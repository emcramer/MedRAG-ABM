Tumors of the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer (TNBC; generally corresponding to the \u201cBasal/Basal-like\u201d subtype of patient datasets, determined by PAM50 gene signatures) lack the expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1, progesterone receptor and HER2, are highly aggressive and are most likely to recur. Unlike the luminal-A tumors that are characterized by better survival, or the HER2+ tumors, TNBC/basal tumors cannot be treated by receptor-targeted therapies and demonstrate high relapse rates following chemotherapy.As with other malignancies, breast tumors develop and progress within an intimate tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies indicate that stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key regulators of tumor progression in cancer. In general, MSCs enrich the TME with tumor-promoting factors, and endow the tumor cells with improved abilities to invade and generate metastases; MSCs also undergo transition to CAFs that promote breast cancer/TNBC progression. Particularly in TNBC, MSCs contribute to higher aggressiveness by promoting the expression of angiogenic factors and pro-metastatic chemokines such as the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts). The axes established by these chemokines and their receptors are well-known for their pro-tumorigenic roles, including in TNBC [e.g., ].Tumor-educated MSCs evolve within a TME enriched with inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which generally promote breast cancer progression. Two such pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). It was demonstrated that despite its potential anti-tumor cytotoxic activities, chronic presence of TNF\u03b1 in tumors has led to tumor progression. Joined with the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory activities of IL-1\u03b2, the two cytokines were identified as pro-metastatic factors in many tumor types. In TNBC, sequencing, serum-profiling and immunohistochemistry studies of small patient cohorts provided initial evidence to relevance of high expression of the two cytokines or of their signaling components to metastasis in TNBC patients; in parallel, studies in animal models have demonstrated causative tumor-promoting roles for TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also connected with pro-malignancy activities of MSCs and CAFs in TNBC. Specifically with regards to chemokines, we and others have shown that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 elevated the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts) by MSCs [; the degree of increase depended on assay conditions], thus promoting the pro-inflammatory and pro-malignancy phenotype of these stromal cells.However, to date, we still lack understanding of the interactions that are established between TNBC cells, stromal cells and their intimate pro-inflammatory TME, and we do not have enough information on the way such interactions affect disease course. Specifically, it is not known whether the pro-metastatic characteristics of the TME and of the tumor cells are increased when TNBC cells interact with MSCs/CAFs in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Thus, the aim of our present study was to identify the influence of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage on the content of pro-metastatic chemokines as proxies for potential pro-malignancy activities that enrich the TME of TNBC tumors, as well as on angiogenesis and on the migratory, invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells.In view of their high relevance to tumor progression in TNBC, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were selected as representatives of the pro-inflammatory TME in our study. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of TNBC:stroma co-cultures by these two cytokines has led to increased pro-metastatic activities at multiple levels, including: expression levels of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, cancer cell morphology, tumor cell migration and tumor cell invasion. Importantly, we found that CXCL8 was a key regulator of the pro-metastatic activities that came into play in the TNBC-stroma-inflammation networks, including angiogenesis, metastasis-related morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Moreover, the tumor-stroma-inflammation network has promoted the metastatic potential of TNBC cells and has led to elevated metastasis in vivo. Parallel in-culture studies that were performed with tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with luminal-A cells demonstrated that in general they were less potent or differently active than those established with TNBC cells.Thus, our findings set the pro-inflammatory inputs acting at the tumor:stroma interface, and their pro-metastatic outputs, as targets for improved therapy in TNBC. Since inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are used vastly in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, our findings suggest that these two cytokines may be considered as novel therapeutic modalities in TNBC. Such an approach, combined with the use of chemokine receptor inhibitors [e.g., of the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2; ], may prevent tumor-stroma interactions that increase metastasis in TNBC.Materials and MethodsAnalyses of Patient DatasetsRNAseq-based gene expression analyses of breast cancer patient data were performed with the TCGA dataset. Subtypes were defined based on the PAM50 annotation file provided within the dataset: Basal (often overlapping the term TNBC): 141 patients; Luminal-A: 421 patients. Gene expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were determined. In all analyses, log2-transformed expression values of the genes were presented. Statistical analyses were performed following Shapiro-Wilk test, determining the normality of distribution for each gene by individual subtype. Comparisons of gene expression levels between the two clinical subtypes were presented in boxplots. p-values were determined by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The distribution of gene expression levels in basal and luminal-A patients was presented in histograms, where statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. In studies correlating the expression levels of the different genes, correlation coefficients and p-values were analyzed using Spearman correlation. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Breast Tumor Cell Lines and Stromal CellsThe human TNBC cell lines (all from ATCC) included: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells that were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Life technologies, Grand island, NY); BT-549 cells that were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Biological Industries); for BT-549 cells, recombinant human (rh) insulin (10 mg/ml; #I9278; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the medium. The human luminal-A cell lines MCF-7 (from ATCC) and T47D [provided by Dr. Keydar who generated the cell line ] were grown in culture in the same medium as MDA-MB-231 cells. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial ST1.6R cells (HPMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Unger and Dr. Kirkpatrick, Institute of Pathology, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. These cells were grown as described in Krump-Konvalinkova et al., with minor modifications.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from Lonza (#PT-2501; Walkersville, MD), which validated them as MSCs based on cell markers and differentiation potential. Routine growth of MSCs took place in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (#PT-3001; Lonza) or in MesenCult (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) and they were used for up to 10 passages. In this study, MSCs of four different healthy donors were used. Patient-derived CAFs from a primary breast tumor (used in ELISA and their accompanying signaling experiments) and from a lung metastasis (used in tumor cell invasion assays) were kindly provided by Dr. Bar, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel). The cells were grown, identified and immortalized as described in Katanov et al..TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Concentrations Used in Different AnalysesTitration studies were initiated by determining the ability of rhTNF\u03b1 (#300-01A, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and rhIL-1\u03b2 (#200-01B, PeproTech) to elevate in MDA-MB-231 cells and/or MSCs/CAFs the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and/or CCL5 to levels that enabled us to perform the required comparisons between different cell combinations in ELISA studies (concentrations studied - TNF\u03b1: 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2: 20, 100, 250, 350, 500, 750 pg/ml). The selected concentrations of 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2 were appropriate also for MSC and CAF experiments. Therefore, in all MDA-MB-231 studies, alone or with MSC/CAF, these selected concentrations were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments.In parallel, titration studies indicated that the above selected concentrations were not optimal for ELISA responses of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cells; thus, based on additional analyses, the concentrations of cytokines were raised in these two cell types: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. These selected cytokine concentrations were used in all studies of MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells, alone or with MSCs.The effects of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 on morphological changes, angiogenesis, migration and invasion with MCF-7 cells were determined in the same concentrations as used for MDA-MB-231 cells (10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2). In ELISA studies (and their accompanying signaling experiments) in MCF-7 and T47D cells cytokine concentrations were raised to 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. Although published data [e.g., ] and our past studies indicated that lower TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (as in MDA-MB-231 cells) induce signaling and up-regulate the levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 in MCF-7 and T47D cells, we expected that these cytokine concentrations will not enable us to clearly distinguish \u201cintermediate\u201d levels of chemokine induction in ELISA assays. Thus, cytokine concentrations were increased, as described above.Western Blot StudiesBased on kinetics analyses (Data not shown), cells were stimulated for 15 min by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle (similar for both cytokines), in medium containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, followed by conventional Western blot (WB) procedures. The following antibodies (Abs) were used: Phosphorylated (P)-p65 [#3033; Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA]; Total (T)-p65 (#8242; CST); P-JNK (#4668; CST); T-JNK (#9258; CST). Abs directed against GAPDH (#ab9485; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) served for loading controls. The membranes were reacted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (#111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (#20-500, Biological Industries).Cell Stimulation in Co-culture ExperimentsTNBC or luminal-A cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs/CAFs (10:1 ratio) in 6-well plates (#3516, Corning, Kennebunk, ME). When relevant, \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures were grown in similar plates, in which the two cell types were separated by an insert of 0.4 \u03bcm permeable polycarbonate membrane (#3412, Corning). In parallel, each cell type was grown individually in the same cell numbers as in co-cultures, in similar plates. The cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS for 12 h, and were then treated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle for 7 h in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Then, media were replaced by cytokine-free media (with 0.5% FBS) for additional 60 h. Cell conditioned media (CM) were removed and taken for ELISA assays. When indicated, CM and cell lysates were produced from cells that were subjected to gene down-regulation by siRNA, as detailed below. Cell lysates were produced from cells grown in larger vessels 7 h or 15 min after the beginning of cytokine stimulation and were used in quantitative real-time PCR analyses (qRT-PCR) or in WB studies.ELISA AssaysCM obtained from different stimulatory conditions were cleared by centrifugation, followed by determining the expression levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 by ELISA. Standard curves at the linear range of absorbance were produced with rhCXCL8, rhCCL2 and rhCCL5 (#200-8M, #300-04 and #300-06, respectively; PeproTech). The following Abs were used (all from PeproTech, unless otherwise indicated): For CXCL8 - Coating Abs: #500-P28; Detecting Abs: #500-P28Bt. For CCL2 - Coating Abs: #500-M71; Detecting Abs: #500-P34Bt. For CCL5 - Coating Abs: #500-M75; Detecting Abs: #BAF278 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (#016-030-084; Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories) was added, followed by the substrate TMB/E solution (#ES001; Millipore, Temecula, CA); then, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To provide data on the contents of chemokines generated in each of the treatments and to clearly denote the differences in chemokine production between the different conditions, the findings are presented in ng/ml.In reversibility experiments, MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 for 67 h or exposed to vehicle control. Media were replaced and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in TNF\u03b1-free media. CM that were collected following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal, were subjected to ELISA analysis of CXCL8 expression as described above.qRT-PCR AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted using the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400; Biological Industries). Using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX), first-strand cDNA was generated from RNA samples. cDNA targets were quantified by qRT-PCR on Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science, Concorde, NSW, Australia). Absolute Blue qPCR SYBR Green ROX mix (#AB-4163/A; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect transcripts, according to manufacturer's instructions. Two pairs of specific primers were used (Supplementary Table 1), designed to span different exons. Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Dissociation curves for each primer set indicated a single product, and \u201cno-template\u201d controls were negative after the 40 cycles used for analysis. Quantification was performed by standard curves, within the linear range of quantification.Endothelial Cell Migration and SproutingTo generate CM for functional in vitro angiogenesis assays, MDA-MB-231:MSC and MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10:1 cell ratio in each) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 7 h; in parallel, CM were produced from tumor cells that were treated by vehicle, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1, or from tumor cells grown with MSCs only. Media were removed and the cells were cultured for additional 60 h in TNF\u03b1-free medium (with 0.5% FBS). CM were collected, cleared by filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane, and loaded in the lower part of migration transwells (#3422, Corning) with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes. The migration of HPMEC cells in direction of the different CM was determined after up to 90 min. At the end of the experiments, cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes, the membranes were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained by Hemacolor (#1.11661; Merck). Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple bright fields were counted.In parallel, CM were also used in sprouting assays of mCherry-expressing HPMECs out of 3D multicellular spheroids (all generated by the same cell number) that were formed in hanging drops for 24 h and embedded into collagen type I (1.3 mg/ml; #354236; Corning). Sprouting of endothelial cells in response to CM was visualized by fluorescent microscopy after 10 days, and was determined quantitatively in multiple spheroids by mCherry signals of cells that sprouted out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ.Tumor Cell Morphology, Migration and InvasionIn morphology assays, \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-expressing tumor cells - MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 - and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 67 h; in parallel, mCherry-tumor cells were grown with vehicle, with TNF\u03b1 only or with MSCs only. Then, tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy at x100 magnification, in multiple fields. In reversibility experiments of MDA-MB-231 cells, media were replaced in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures after 67 h, and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in cytokine-free medium. Morphology was determined following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal.Migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in transwells with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes (#3422, Corning). In these assays, mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were added to the upper part of the chambers, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. The same number of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in parallel transwells, in the presence of vehicle control or of TNF\u03b1 alone. Migration was performed for 12 h toward medium containing 10% FBS [containing TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, as appropriate]. The numbers of migrating tumor cells were determined by staining with rabbit Abs to RPF (recognizing mCherry; #PM005; MBL, Woburn, MA), followed by DyLight 550-conjugated Donkey Abs recognizing rabbit IgG (#ab96920, Abcam). Cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Based on DyLight 550 signals and Hemacolor staining used in preliminary analyses (Data not shown), we validated that close to 100% of migrating cells were the tumor cells. Photos of multiple high power fluorescent fields were taken at \u00d7 100 magnification. Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple fluorescence fields were counted.Migration of Hoechst-labeled MCF-7 cells was determined by using the same experimental groups as in TNBC studies. MCF-7 cells are known as having a relatively low basal migratory potential, thus appropriate conditions were set, based on published studies and preliminary analyses in our lab. Thus, the membranes were coated with fibronectin for 1 h (20 \u03bcg/ml; #03-090-1, Biological Industries), cells were loaded to the upper part and after 21 h photos were taken. Hoechst-expressing tumor cells that migrated to the lower side of the membranes were counted in multiple fields.Tumor cell invasion assays were performed using 3D multicellular spheroids that were generated for 72 h in hanging-drops [, with minor modifications]. Spheroids of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, consisting of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs/CAFs (ratio 10:1) were embedded into matrigel (9\u201310.5 mg/ml; #356234, Corning) and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Spheroids were also formed with mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells alone, and treated by TNF\u03b1 or by vehicle (same number of cells as in co-cultures). Invasion of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells was determined 48 h after the addition of cytokine stimulation (or vehicle). Multiple spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields at x40 magnification. The invaded area was determined by the mCherry signals of cells that invaded out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ. Invasion of MCF-7 cells was determined in a similar manner after 96 h, using mCherry-MCF-7 cells and patient-derived CAFs, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or its vehicle control. Spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields 96 h after the addition of stimulation, at \u00d7 40 magnification.CXCL8 Down-Regulation by siRNAKnock-down of CXCL8 expression by transient siRNA transfections was performed in both MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs, using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (#56531; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGET plus siRNA CXCL8 SMART pool and non-targeting control siRNA pool (siCTRL) were used (#L-004756-00 and #D-001810-10, respectively; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The efficacy of CXCL8 down-regulation was validated by qRT-PCR or ELISA [Data not shown; 80\u201390% as in ] and the cells were used in assays, as necessary.Tumor Growth and Metastasis\u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs (10:1 ratio) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or vehicle control, in 0.5% FBS-containing medium for 67 h. In each group (Group 1: Co-culture with TNF\u03b1; Group 2: Co-culture with vehicle), the same amount of live co-cultured cells was mixed 1:1 with matrigel (final concentration 4.5 mg/ml; #356234; Corning). The cells were administered orthotopically to the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (#NUDE242; Envigo RMS, Jerusalem, Israel). During the experiment, tumors of Group 1 were supplemented every 3 days by CM taken from MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures; these CM were generated as follows: The co-cultures were stimulated for 7 h with TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), after which the cytokine was removed, and CM were collected after additional 60 h of growth in cytokine-free and serum-free medium. These CM were filtered, concentrated \u00d7 10, and administered in proximity to tumors. Cytokine- and serum-free media that were put in parallel flasks have undergone similar procedures, and were administered to tumors of Group 2. At the endpoint of experiments (when tumors reached detectable sizes and had to be removed prior to necrosis), approximately 30 days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were sacrificed and primary tumors and lungs were excised. Tumor weights were determined, and tumor volumes were calculated based on caliper measurements. Lung metastases were determined ex vivo by the CRi Maestro non-invasive intravital imaging system. The total number of mice that were included in two biological repeats were 12 in Group 1, and 11 in Group 2. Statistical analyses of primary tumor weight and volume were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. The proportions of mice bearing lung metastases were compared by Fisher's exact test. Procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines and policies.Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysesThe statistical analyses of TCGA analyses and in vivo experiments were described in their respective sections. In vitro experiments were performed in n \u2265 3 independent experimental repeats, with MSCs from \u22652 different donors, as indicated in respective figure legends. The results of ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, HPMEC sprouting and tumor cell migration and invasion assays were compared by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling the FDR at 0.05. All the significant results remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity, except for some of the WB results. It these latter cases lack of significance was due to high variance between the intensities of effects of the experimental repeats of the test, despite the fact that they all demonstrated the same trend. Thus, in presentation of WB analyses we demonstrate not only the average and standard deviations (SD) of the experimental repeats but also the level of effect in each experiment.ResultsHigh Expression Levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Are Noted in Tumors of Basal Patients and Are Significantly Coordinated With High Expression Levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5To identify the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating tumor-stroma interactions in TNBC, we have extended currently-available studies on TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients and compared the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in two subtypes of breast tumors: (1) Basal tumors, corresponding to the TNBC subtype, which has a most aggressive phenotype; (2) Luminal-A tumors having the best prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes.Here, by using the TCGA breast cancer dataset we found that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were expressed in significantly higher levels in basal tumors than in luminal-A tumors (Figures 1A1,B1). Distribution analyses (Figures 1A2,B2) demonstrated a larger proportion of basal patients with high TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels, than luminal-A patients. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, chosen as proxies for pro-tumorigenic factors that may be enriched in basal patients due to pro-inflammatory signals. These studies demonstrated significantly higher levels of the three chemokines in basal patients than in luminal-A patients (Figures 1C\u2013E).The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their chemokine targets are significantly higher in basal patients than in luminal-A patients. The Figure demonstrates gene expression analyses, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) TNF\u03b1, (B) IL-1\u03b2, (C) CXCL8, (D) CCL2, (E) CCL5.

(A2\u2013E2) Histograms demonstrating the distribution of expression levels of each of the factors in basal and luminal-A patient tumors. RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Moreover, as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are key inducers of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 expression [e.g., ] we also determined the correlation between the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and each of the three chemokines in basal patients. The findings of Figure 2 indicate that the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly correlated and coordinated with the presence of CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 in basal tumors.In basal patients, the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are significantly coordinated with the expression levels of their chemokine targets. The Figure demonstrates correlation analyses of gene expression in basal patients, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) CXCL8 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (A1) and IL-1\u03b2 (A2).

First, we validated that the two cytokines could activate transcription pathways that typically induce the expression of these chemokines, namely NF-\u03baB/p65 and JNK/AP-1. Indeed, these pathways were rapidly activated by a brief TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of 15 min (time point and cytokine concentrations were determined by preliminary analyses) in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and in MSCs (Figure 3A).CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK, determined by WB in MSCs and in human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells upon 15 min stimulation by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle control (based on kinetics and titration studies. Information on cytokine concentrations is given in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). GAPDH was used as a loading control. (A1) A representative experiment and (A2) averages \u00b1 SD of p65 and JNK activation (fold induction) in n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. ***p < 0.001, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between the values obtained for cytokine-stimulated cells and control non-stimulated cells. Dashed line stands for the value of 1 given to control cells. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels were determined in TNBC:MSC co-cultures or each of the cell types grown alone, with or without TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs were generated in \u201cTranswell\u201d and \u201cContact\u201d conditions and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (350 pg/ml) or vehicle control (similar for both cytokines) for 7 h. After change of media and growth for additional 60 h, the extracellular expression of CXCL8 in TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-free CM was determined by ELISA. ***p \u2264 0.001, **p \u2264 0.01, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between TNF\u03b1- or IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells and vehicle-treated cells, within each group. #p-values were <0.01 or <0.001 (in most cases) in comparisons of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments, as well as in comparisons of \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments. The results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.Then, to determine if CXCL8 is regulated by tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures were plated in \u201cContact\u201d conditions that enabled direct physical contacts between the two cell types or in \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions that allowed only for the exchange of soluble factors between tumor cells and stromal cells. These co-cultures and each cell type alone were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (or their vehicle) for 7 h (Cytokine concentrations were selected based on titration assays, as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d); the cytokines were removed and cytokine-free CM were collected 60 h later. These experiments revealed that the highest levels of CXCL8 were produced when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B1), and that they were higher than in all other conditions including non-stimulated co-cultures and individual cell types treated with either cytokine. CXCL8 protein levels were elevated also in cytokine-stimulated \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions; however, their total levels (ng/ml) were significantly lower than in cytokine-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 3B1). Accompanying qRT-PCR analyses indicated that CXCL8 induction was regulated at the transcription level (Supplementary Figure 1A), and that increased CXCL8 levels in cytokine-stimulated co-cultures did not result of elevated proliferation of the cells under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 2). Accordingly, we did not detect any substantial cell death or proliferation of any of the cell types due to cellular interactions or cytokine stimulation (Data not shown).Additional experiments revealed similar regulatory modes for CCL2, demonstrating its highest expression levels in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures, obtained partly in a contact-dependent process (Figure 3B2). With CCL5, absolute dependence on TNBC:MSC contacts was revealed, and its expression was further elevated when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B3). As with CXCL8, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 by elevating their mRNA levels (Supplementary Figures 1B,C).Additional analyses performed with TNBC cells that interacted with breast cancer patient-derived CAFs revealed similar regulatory patterns to those described above with MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures: TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation in CAFs (Figure 4A) and elevated all three pro-metastatic chemokines to their highest levels of expression when tumor-stroma-inflammation interactions took place (Figure 4B); moreover, CXCL8 and CCL2 up-regulation depended partly on cell-to-cell contacts whereas induction of CCL5 was fully dependent on direct physical contacts between the tumor cells and the CAFs, and was further induced by stimulation with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:CAF \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, using similar cytokine concentrations. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.In view of the high heterogeneity of TNBC tumors, we asked if similar regulatory patterns exist in co-cultures of other human TNBC cells - MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 - with MSCs. The findings of Figure 5A indicate that in both cell lines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation and that the highest CXCL8 expression levels were produced when these TNBC cells physically interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5B). Of interest, the elevation in CXCL8 levels following cytokine stimulation of MDA-MB-468:MSC co-cultures partly depended on physical contacts between the two cell types (Figure 5B1), as was seen in MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures (Figure 3B1). In parallel, in BT-549:MSC co-cultures, CXCL8 elevation in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells depended on cell-to-cell contacts, while TNF\u03b1 did not have much of an impact under \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 5B2).Increased production of CXCL8 is a general characteristic of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with TNBC cells. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with human TNBC MDA-MB-468, BT-549 cells and MSCs. Cytokine concentrations: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. \u2227In panel 5B1, this value was significant in 2 out of 3 experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.To follow up on the data of Figure 1, indicating that the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their targets - CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 - were significantly lower in luminal-A patients than in basal patients, we determined how these three chemokines are affected by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of luminal-A:MSC co-cultures. Despite the fact that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced potent p65 and JNK activation in T47D and MCF-7 luminal-A cells (Figures 6A, 7A), CXCL8 levels were not increased but rather were decreased when the tumor cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figures 6B1, 7B). In parallel, CCL2 and CCL5 levels were increased by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated T47D:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (Figures 6B2,B3), but their expression levels were, in general, much lower than those obtained by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures (Figures 3B2,B3). Further studies with MCF-7 luminal-A cells demonstrated elevations in the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 in some of the assays under \u201cContact\u201d co-culture conditions following TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation; however, the expression levels of these chemokines were often too low to provide clear-cut results (Data not shown).CXCL8 expression is down-regulated in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated luminal-A (T47D): MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with T47D cells and MSCs.

To this end, in the TNBC part we focused on the MDA-MB-231 cells because of their high metastatic potential. In luminal-A studies we chose to investigate MCF-7 cells because of our previous research indicating that they expressed more robust metastasis-related properties than T47D cells when stimulated by pro-inflammatory signals; additional investigations by our group also indicated that MCF-7 cells responded vigorously to TNF\u03b1-containing TME signals in in vivo metastasis studies.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Established With TNBC Cells Lead to Elevated AngiogenesisTo determine the functional consequences of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, we first determined the ability of factors released by TNBC:MSC co-cultures stimulated by TNF\u03b1 to promote processes involved in angiogenesis. Here, endothelial cells (HPMEC) sprouting assays demonstrated conclusive evidence to higher angiogenesis-supporting potential of TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC (Supplementary Figure 3) compared to CM obtained from control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, these studies did not reveal concrete information on the angiogenic potential of CM obtained from tumor cells + MSCs or from tumor cells + TNF\u03b1. Thus, additional studies were designed to provide another level of information on the ability of CM derived from the different groups to induce the migration of HPMEC in response to CM derived from different conditions. This assay enabled us to clearly demonstrate that the highest levels of endothelial cell migration were achieved when MDA-MB-231 cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 8A). Moreover, our findings emphasized the contribution of TNF\u03b1 to the angiogenic potential revealed by tumor cells grown in the presence of stromal cells.The pro-angiogenic activities of factors released by tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are promoted by TNF\u03b1 in TNBC but not in luminal-A cells. Studies of endothelial cell (HPMEC) migration in response to CM derived from different cell combinations of MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) (A) and MCF-7 cells (B). (A1, B1) Representative photos of HPMEC migration in response to TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10 ng/ml), from tumor cells alone, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 alone and from tumor cells grown under \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs only.

Photos and their quantifications are representatives of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.We then performed parallel studies with luminal-A MCF-7 cells and found that CM of \u201cContact\u201d MCF-7:MSC co-cultures had strong angiogenic activities as with TNBC cells (Figure 8B); however, in contrast to our studies with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8A), in studies of MCF-7 cells TNF\u03b1 did not push the angiogenic response induced by CM of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures any further.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Promote the Migratory and Invasive Properties of TNBC CellsNext, we determined the effects of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network on tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. First, we found that in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, the tumor cells acquired very elongated morphology (Figure 9A1) which is typical of cells that express high motility capabilities. The morphology of the tumor cells under this condition was robustly different from the morphology of tumor cells grown alone, of tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and of tumor cells grown with MSCs only (Figure 9A1). These studies were followed by migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells, known as having an aggressive phenotype which is manifested by a relatively high basal migratory potential. Despite their high basal motility, the interactions of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 have led to significantly higher migratory capacity of the tumor cells compared to tumor cells grown alone (Figure 9A2). Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells grown in the presence of MSCs only or with TNF\u03b1 alone did not migrate as well as tumor cells grown with MSCs and TNF\u03b1 (Figure 9A2). Supplementary Figure 4 demonstrates representative photos of MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated in the different study groups, identified by fluorescent staining.TNBC cells, and less so luminal-A cells, acquire migration-related characteristics upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1.

Migration assays were performed in response to medium containing 10% FBS, for 12 h. ***p < 0.001, ns=non-significant for differences between migration of tumor cells in different combinations, compared to the migration of non-stimulated TNBC cells. \u2227In panel (A2), this value was significant in 1 out of 3 experiments.

In all sections of Part (B), the Figures demonstrate representative experiments of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of \u22652 different donors.In parallel, experiments performed with MCF-7 cells indicated that their morphology was modified by TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 9B1) toward a metastasis-relevant phenotype [in line with our findings in ]. MCF-7 cells that grew in contact with MSCs also demonstrated modifications in their morphology, different than those induced by TNF\u03b1 stimulation. However, in contrast to our findings with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A1), when TNF\u03b1 was added to MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, no additivity was found between TNF\u03b1 and the MSCs in inducing more robust morphological changes in the tumor cells (Figure 9B1). Of note, the TNF\u03b1-stimulated MCF-7 cells that grew in co-culture with MSCs acquired elevated migratory capacity compared to control cells (Figure 9B2; Supplementary Figure 5). However, the overall migratory potential of MCF-7 cells at the tumor-stroma-inflammation setting (Figure 9B2) was much lower of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A2), although the two cell types were plated in same numbers in migration transwells. The relatively low migratory capacities of MCF-7 cells were noted despite the fact that they were given the proper conditions to support their migration (fibronectin coating of membranes and longer migration time than MDA-MB-231 cells).To follow up on these findings, we investigated the ability of TNBC cells to invade out of 3D spheroids, a process requiring migration and invasion through extracellular proteins. We noted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells when they interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 10), compared to all other cell combinations. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells exerted significantly increased invasion also when they interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the context of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 11A; Please see \u201cNote\u201d in the legend of Figure 11A). In contrast to the TNBC cells, MCF-7 luminal-A cells that interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 demonstrated very minor, if any, invasive properties (Figure 11B), even after longer invasion time compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (96 h for MCF-7 cells; 48 h for MDA-MB-231 cells).TNBC cells acquire elevated invasive properties upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1. The Figure demonstrates tumor cell invasion out of 3D spheroids that were formed by mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) alone or by tumor cells in \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs. The spheroids were imbedded into matrigel and then stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle for 48 h. (A) Representative photos. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.

[\u2227Note: Possibly due to technical reasons (different matrigel batches) TNF\u03b1 stimulation elevated tumor cell invasion in this setting but not in Figure 10]. (A1) Representative photos.

(B) MCF-7 cells have undergone similar procedures to those described in Figure 10, for 96 h (TNF\u03b1 10 ng/ml).

Instead, two representative photos out of many taken in n > 3 independent experiments, are provided for each treatment.

To connect between these two processes, we asked if CXCL8 - selected because of its robust pro-angiogenic activities and pro-metastatic effects at the levels of TME and the tumor cells alike - was involved in mediating the functional properties of TNBC cells when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established.To this end, we generated TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in which CXCL8 was down-regulated in high efficiency by siRNA in the tumor cells and in the MSCs simultaneously [80\u201390% efficiency was found in CXCL8 down-regulation by the siRNA, similar to our findings in our parallel study; that study also demonstrates which of the cells contributed more to CXCL8 production when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established with MDA-MB-231 cells]. The findings of Figure 12 clearly indicate that CXCL8 played significant roles in driving forward all metastasis-related alterations that were induced by the tumor-stroma-inflammation network in TNBC. Here, we found that in the absence of CXCL8 expression, endothelial cell migration in response to CM of TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures was significantly reduced (Figure 12A). Moreover, upon CXCL8 down-regulation, the migration-relevant morphology of the tumor cells was partly reversed (Figure 12B), and the migration and particularly the invasion potentials of the tumor cells were significantly reduced (Figures 12C,D).Tumor-stroma-inflammation networks lead through CXCL8 activities to increased angiogenesis, invasion-related tumor cell morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) and MSCs were both transfected by siCXCL8 or siCTRL. Parallel studies indicated that the efficiency of CXCL8 down-regulation was high [80\u201390% in most experiments, as in; Data not shown]. The cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml); then, the cells or their CM were assayed in the following tests: (A) Endothelial cell migration (Procedures as in Figure 8A). ***p < 0.001; (B) Tumor cell morphology (Procedures as in Figure 9A1). Bar, 50 \u03bcm; (C) Tumor cell migration (Procedures as in Figure 9A2). ***p < 0.001; (D) Tumor cell invasion (Procedures as in Figure 10). (D1) Representative photos. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.

Yet, they have not directly determined the impact of the pro-inflammatory signals on tumor growth and metastasis when TNBC:stroma interactions are established. Our above findings motivated us to determine whether the pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 to TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in vitro would potentiate tumor growth or metastasis in an animal model system.The ability of TNF\u03b1 to potentiate the in vivo aggressiveness of TNBC cells grown with MSCs requires that the in vitro advantages given to the tumor cells by their 3-day exposure to MSCs and to the cytokine, will persist in vivo (the cytokine is removed prior to injection to mice); Thus, we first determined whether the increased pro-metastatic capabilities endowed on the tumor cells by their co-culturing with stromal cells in the presence of TNF\u03b1 withhold when TNF\u03b1 is removed. To this end, TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were established for 67 h with TNF\u03b1 stimulation, leading to high CXCL8 levels and clear changes in tumor cell morphology (Figures 13A,B); then, TNF\u03b1 was removed and the growth of TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures was continued in TNF\u03b1-deprived medium for ~2 weeks. The findings of Figure 13 demonstrate that the effects of TNF\u03b1 were reversible: ~2 weeks after TNF\u03b1 removal the elevation in CXCL8 was completely abolished (Figure 13A) and the elongated cell morphology was almost entirely diminished (Figure 13B).TNF\u03b1 promotes the metastatic potential of TNBC cells grown in contact with MSCs. (A,B) Reversibility of TNF\u03b1-induced tumor-promoting phenotypes, generated in vitro in \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures following TNF\u03b1 removal. mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 67 h (termed \u201c~3 days of TNF\u03b1 stimulation\") (A1,B1). Then, vehicle-treated and TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSCs co-cultures were re-cultured without further TNF\u03b1 stimulation for additional 10\u201314 days (termed \u201c~3 days of stimulation + ~2 weeks W/O TNF\u03b1 stimulation) (A2,B2). At both time points (~3 days and ~2 weeks), extracellular CXCL8 levels were determined in cell supernatants by ELISA (A) and tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy (B). ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant. Bar, 50 \u03bcm. In all panels of section (A,B), the results are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. (C,D) mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, for 67 h (~3 days). Then, co-cultured cells were injected to the mammary fat pad of nude mice in 2 independent experiments (For additional experimental details please see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Total mice numbers were: (1) In the group of mice administered with TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures: n = 12; (2) In the group of mice administered with vehicle-exposed co-cultures: n = 11. At the end of the experiment (~30 days post injection), primary tumor size was determined by volume (C1) and weight (C2). ns=non-significant. (D) Metastases in lungs were detected by mCherry signals using the Cri Maestro fluorescence imaging system. \u2227p = 0.095.Taking into account these findings on reversibility of TNF\u03b1-mediated effects, proposing that the benefits that were provided by TNF\u03b1 stimulation to TNBC:MSC co-cultures may not persist in vivo, we proceeded to the animal system setting. Here, we introduced an experimental design that will enable us to directly assess the impacts of TNF\u03b1 on the metastatic potential of TNBC cells when they interacted with stromal cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 for 67 h, and were compared to vehicle-exposed MDA-MB-231:MSC cultures, serving as controls. The cells were then administered to the mammary fat pads of female mice. To strengthen in vivo the possible effects of TNF\u03b1 when it acted on MDA-MB-231 and MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, CM containing factors released by TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (but deprived of TNF\u03b1 itself) were injected in proximity to tumors generated by TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures; in parallel, control media were administered to tumors arising from injection of vehicle-treated co-cultures. The findings of Figure 13C indicate that the sizes and weights of primary tumors were similar in the two groups of mice; however, most importantly, the metastatic potential of the tumor cells that interacted with MSCs was increased by in-culture TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 13D). This effect was revealed by the elevated incidence of mice carrying lung metastases following MDA-MB-231 co-culturing with MSC under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in vitro, compared to the control group in which the co-cultured cells were not exposed to TNF\u03b1 (Figure 13D).DiscussionThe fundamental roles of the TME in promoting cancer progression are now well-appreciated, with stromal cells and pro-inflammatory elements being key contributors to disease development and metastasis. In the complex milieu that exists in tumors, cross-talks between the different TME players and the tumor cells eventually establish intricate networks whose roles in dictating disease course are still poorly defined and characterized.In the present study, we were particularly interested in elucidating the roles of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks in regulating tumor progression in TNBC, a most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In our study, we have used potent and most clinically relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines - TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 - that are expressed in breast tumors and have pro-metastatic functions in TNBC. Our study provides novel findings indicating that interactions between TNBC cells and MSCs/CAFs in the presence of such pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to significantly enhanced pro-metastatic phenotypes of the TME and of the tumor cells themselves. This was illustrated by increased expression of pro-metastatic chemokines, by elevated ability to induce angiogenesis, as well as by higher migratory and invasive capabilities of the tumor cells. Ultimately, the end result of the activities of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was a higher metastatic potential of TNBC cells in vivo.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network was found in our study to strongly induce the expression of the pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. These chemokines are pro-inflammatory factors and as such contribute to cancer inflammation by recruiting myeloid inflammatory cells, as well as immune-suppressive cells, to tumors and metastases. In addition, of the three chemokines, particularly CXCL8 but also CCL2, are potent angiogenic factors that contribute to TNBC progression. Moreover, direct activities of the chemokines on tumor cells have led to increased invasion in TNBC cells.As part of their pro-metastatic roles in TNBC, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors - for example, CXCR2 for CXCL8 and CCR2 for CCL2 - contributed to the pro-tumorigenic activities of stromal cells in TNBC mouse model systems. MSC/fibroblast-derived chemokines, including murine CXCL1 and CXCL2 (counterparts of human CXCL8), CCL2 and CCL5 were associated with recruitment of neutrophils, tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to TNBC tumors, where they promoted disease course. CXCL8 and CCL5, produced by bone marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs were prime inducers of metastasis in TNBC, acting by elevating the proliferation and invasive properties of the tumor cells, and their resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, MSC-derived CCL2 has attracted macrophages to TNBC tumors, activating them to secrete CXCL8, thus leading to an overall increase in tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells.The above studies strengthen the relevance and importance of our observations on the strong induction of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 when TNBC cells interacted with MSCs/CAFs in the context of pro-inflammatory stimuli, introduced by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. As noted above, both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were found to be responsible for increased aggressiveness in TNBC, and in several studies were connected to increased pro-malignancy functions of MSCs/CAFs. For example, the findings by Shi and colleagues indicated that TNF\u03b1-activated MSCs promoted via CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands the metastatic ability of murine TNBC cells. TNF\u03b1-primed MSCs were also found to reprogram neutrophils to acquire immunosuppressive functions. Other studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-231-derived CM elevated IL-1\u03b2 release by MSCs, increasing their pro-inflammatory nature. In parallel, MSC-derived IL-1\u03b2 increased the proliferation and chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.However, these studies did not address the wider scope of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network, and did not identify the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating TNBC-stroma interactions. Here, our current study provides novel findings, emphasizing the need for both TNBC:MSC cross-talk and pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, in order to achieve the most substantial levels of pro-metastatic activities: high levels of pro-metastatic chemokines, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, our findings suggest that previous studies on TNF\u03b1-treated MSCs that induced anti-tumor activities in TNBC tumors may have overlooked the actual setting that takes place in vivo, when TNBC cells interact with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation.Of major importance in this context is the fact that CXCL8 was revealed in our current study as a key player in mediating the pro-metastatic functional effects of the inflammation-driven tumor-stroma networks in TNBC: angiogenesis, migration-related morphology of the tumor cells, as well as cancer cell migration and invasion. The effects of CXCL8 down-regulation on these pro-metastatic functions in TNBC was pronounced, and our results suggest that it can probably act in cooperativity with other factors that are produced under these network conditions to promote the aggressiveness of TNBC cells that interacted with stromal cells in the context of the pro-inflammatory TME.Here, it is interesting to note that the tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established by luminal-A cells were less potent or differently active than those generated in TNBC, in all aspects: chemokine production, angiogenesis, and tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. These findings may reflect the fact that TNBC cells and luminal breast tumor cells interact differently with fibroblasts. They also agree well with our TCGA results demonstrating lower expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and of the three chemokines in luminal-A patients compared to basal patients. Ultimately, these findings may provide a partial explanation to the more aggressive clinical course of TNBC tumors compared to luminal-A tumors.Overall, our observations suggest that at the TME of TNBC tumors, which is enriched with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the two pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate tumor-stroma interactions that occur at the tumor site, and that under these conditions the in vivo aggressiveness of the tumor cells is increased. It would be interesting to establish similar systems with murine TNBC cells and investigate the possible effects of similar tumor-stroma-inflammation networks and of specific corresponding mouse chemokines on the immune and inflammatory contextures of mice tumors and metastases. Such systems may also enable further analyses that correlate the extent of stroma cell presence with the extent of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as with patterns of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network identified in our study suggests that inhibiting the activities of TNBC-typical pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 would halt tumor-stroma interactions that stand in the basis of TNBC progression. Indeed, inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are in clinical use in inflammatory diseases and were found to inhibit the aggressiveness phenotype of TNBC cells. Obviously, implementation of inhibitory modalities to these cytokines in the in vivo and even more so in the clinical setting would require improved understanding of the entire context of their activities; for example, the activation and regulatory networks of TNF\u03b1 and its TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors take place at multiple regulatory levels that need improved understanding.These considerations emphasize the relevance of the metastatic chemokines that are elevated due to the activity of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage, particularly CXCL8, to therapy. Inhibitors of the axes of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors are also available, suggesting that treatments of TNBC cancers with combination therapies of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may provide novel treatment options for TNBC patients.Ethics StatementAll procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policies.Author ContributionsYL generated all data, and was extensively engaged in study design and manuscript preparation.

Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, shown in Figure 4A, demonstrate the reduction in colonization and establishment of pulmonary metastasis following COX-2 downregulation.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G. Representative \u03b1-SMA immunoblots obtained from an MDA-MB-231 and a Clone 13 tumor are presented in Figure 5H and demonstrate the decrease of \u03b1-SMA expression following COX-2 downregulation.Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from A.

Representative \u03b1-SMA immunoblot obtained from an MDA-MB-231 and a Clone 13 tumor.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse. A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

Recent studies demonstrated that breast tumors are populated by myofibroblasts that express pro-cancerous functions, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Various origins of these cells may exist, including resident tissue fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) that have been continuously exposed to tumor-derived and TME constituents. Such MSCs, originating in bone marrow (BM) or adipose tissues generally have pro-cancerous effects that promote malignancy in many tumor systems, including breast cancer. In vitro, tumor cell products that are present in tumor-derived conditioned medium (CM) convert MSCs to CAFs which become fully and potently functional in promoting malignancy in vivo.The activities of CAFs and MSCs do not take place in the void, but rather are integrated in their intimate TME. In many cancers, the TME is dominated by inflammatory elements, including inflammatory leukocytes and inflammatory soluble factors that generally promote disease progression. The inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) are often present in the inflammatory milieu of many tumors. In contrast to tumor-cytotoxic effects caused by acute local TNF-\u03b1 administration, chronic and persistent presence of TNF-\u03b1 in tumors has strong pro-tumoral effects in many cancers. Accordingly, inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 or its receptors has prominent anti-tumor effects in animal models of breast cancer. In parallel, major causative pro-tumoral roles were attributed to IL-1\u03b2 in breast cancer via angiogenesis and matrix-remodeling activities. Overall, based on recent studies addressing the roles of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in malignancy, both cytokines are now considered potential targets for therapy in cancer.We recently reported that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were minimally expressed by normal breast epithelial cells, but were highly expressed in tumor cells of biopsies from most breast cancer patients. In such individuals, the elevated expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 was significantly correlated with relapse and advanced disease. Despite emerging information on the impact of these inflammatory cytokines on tumor-promoting events in stromal cells, their ability to shape the inflammatory phenotype of CAFs and MSCs has been only partly revealed.Recent studies indicate that CAFs and MSCs promote malignancy through the expression of inflammatory chemokines. In this respect, inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 MCP-1), CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL5 (RANTES) are of major relevance because they promote aggressiveness in tumor cells, they induce tumor-supporting effects in cells of the TME, and they play direct roles in advancing tumor growth and metastasis in many cancer diseases, including cancer of the breast. MSC-derived and CAF-derived inflammatory chemokines promote tumor progression by inducing the infiltration of pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells to tumors (such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)), increasing angiogenesis, elevating tumor cell stemness, invasion and proliferation, and promoting the recruitment of MSCs to primary tumors and metastases. Overall, the outcome of such chemokine activities is a pronounced promotion of cancer progression and tumor cell dissemination to distant organs.Our overall goal in this study was to investigate aspects of inflammation\u2013stroma interactions in breast cancer. To this end, we determined the influence of breast tumor-derived factors and of inflammatory cytokines on the inflammatory phenotype of CAFs and MSCs, manifested by the release of the pro-cancerous chemokines CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 by these cells. The novel findings obtained in this study show intensive inflammation\u2013stroma interactions that act specifically through the designated pathway of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation in stromal cells. Through these interactions, the inflammatory microenvironment shapes the tumor-promoting phenotype of MSCs and CAFs and may thus enhance tumor progression.MethodsBreast tumor cell culturesHuman breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and MCF-7 cells were kindly provided by Prof. Kaye, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. The MCF-7 cells were authenticated on the basis of published characteristics of MCF-7 cells by verifying that they express an active estrogen receptor alpha, respond to estrogen, express low levels of ErbB2, form tumors upon supplementation of estrogen and matrigel, and have low metastatic potential. These cells were grown in enriched Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), including 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin, and 4 mM l-glutamine (Biological Industries, Beit Ha\u2019emek, Israel).Isolation of CAFs from patient breast tumorsCAFs were obtained from surgically resected breast tumors of patients who provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sheba Medical Center. Tissues were cut into small pieces, shaken overnight at 37\u00b0C in collagenase type 4 (250 U/ml, #S3J6523; Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ, USA) in DMEM, filtered (100 mm cell strainer; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and plated in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM l-glutamine, minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids, antibiotics and 60 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Biological Industries; and Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells propagated in these conditions had typical fibroblastic phenotype: their identity was verified by the absence of the epithelial marker cytokeratin and the presence of the typical mesenchymal markers vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1) and fibroblast-activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1) (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). The cells were routinely grown in medium as above or in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 to 20% FBS with regular tissue culture additives.Two human patient-derived CAF isolates were generated and characterized for CAF phenotype as described above. CAFs #1 cells were derived from a lung metastasis of breast cancer and were immortalized by human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), as described previously. CAFs #2 cells were derived from a primary breast tumor of a different patient and were kept in culture without hTERT immortalization.Origins and growth of MSCsTwo sources of human BM-derived MSCs of healthy individuals were used in the study. First, in the earlier stages of the study, human MSCs were isolated from unprocessed BM of healthy individuals obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MD, USA; Cambrex at that time) and were cultured in mesencult medium (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). Following establishment in culture, the isolated MSCs were cultured in \u03b1-minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin (as in). In line with typical characteristics of MSCs, the isolated cells expressed CD44, CD105, CD90, HLA-ABC and Stro1, while they were negative for CD45, HLA-DR and CD11b (see; data not shown), as determined by flow cytometry using FITC-labeled antibodies (BD Biosciences). Expanded cultures of human BM-derived MSCs were analyzed for adipogenic, osteogenic and myogenic differentiation in vitro, to determine multipotency (data not shown). Second, at the advanced stages of the study, fully characterized MSCs were purchased from Lonza. As indicated in Lonza\u2019s datasheet, the cells had typical MSC characteristics. They expressed CD44, CD29, CD105, and CD166 and did not express CD45, CD14 and CD34. Also, the cells can differentiate to adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages when cultured in the recommended differentiation medium. The cells were thawed into enriched mesencult medium (Stemcell Technologies Inc.) and then were subcultured every 5 to 7 days in enriched DMEM medium. In all cases, cell growth was continued in DMEM medium for a limited number of passages (generally up to 10 passages).Long-term growth of MSCs with Tumor CM, followed by TNF-\u03b1 stimulationMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast tumor cells were grown in enriched DMEM culture medium (as above). Tumor CM from these cancer cells was collected after 18 to 24 hours, centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes and supernatants were passed through sterile filters with 0.45 \u03bcm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). MSCs were exposed to such fresh Tumor CM twice a week for a ~30-day time period, following the protocol described in that has generated CAFs which promoted tumor growth in vivo in past experiments. In parallel, control MSCs from the same initiating cell stock were cultured with enriched DMEM medium. To verify the CAF-like phenotype of cells generated by this process (termed herein CAFs), in this study we used criteria of modified morphology and typical CAF markers: the expression of vimentin, upregulation of \u03b1SMA expression (Figure S2 in Additional file 1) and elevated expression of FSP1 (performed for MCF-7 CM only; data not shown).CAFs obtained by stimulating MSCs for ~30 days and their control MSCs were trypsinized, centrifuged and counted. The cells were plated at equivalent density and, following an additional 24 hours of incubation, supernatants from the differentiated CAFs and from control MSCs were frozen in \u221220\u00b0C. In parallel, an aliquot of the original Tumor CM was frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. All supernatants were then thawed at the same time (from CAFs obtained by incubation with Tumor CM, from control MSCs that were grown for the same time period and the CM of the tumor cells themselves) for determination of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 levels in these supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).In other assays, this same procedure was utilized in the presence of short stimulation by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), carried out during the last 24 hours of culture. TNF-\u03b1 working concentrations were chosen based on criteria described next in Stimulation of MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. As control for TNF-\u03b1, the cells were incubated with the vehicle of the cytokine (0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 levels in cell supernatants were determined by ELISA.Stimulation of MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2MSCs were cultured for 24 hours in enriched DMEM medium. The medium was then removed, and cells were incubated for 24 hours in medium containing TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) or IL-1\u03b2 (500 pg/ml) (PeproTech). Cytokine working concentrations were chosen based on calibrations performed in other cell systems in our laboratory and are in the accepted range used in vitro in other studies (several selected publications). Chemokine expression in cell supernatants was determined by ELISA. In controls, we verified that the vehicle of the cytokines (0.1% BSA) did not induce chemokine release by the MSCs.In specific cases, neutralizing antibodies or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used. For experiments with antibodies to TNF-\u03b1 receptors, MSCs were plated in enriched DMEM medium for 24 hours. The cells were then washed and incubated in DMEM medium supplemented with 1% FBS, in the presence of neutralizing antibodies for tumor necrosis factor receptors TNF-RI and TNF-RII (10 \u03bcg/ml, #MAB225 and #MAB726, respectively; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or isotype-matched nonrelevant antibody control (10 \u03bcg/ml, #400101; BioLegend, Roselle, San Diego, USA) for 1 hour. Antibody concentrations were chosen based on preliminary analyses, in which several concentrations of neutralizing antibodies were tested (data not shown). Following this incubation period, TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) or its vehicle (as above) was added to cells. After 24 hours, cell supernatants were collected for ELISA assays.For experiments with siRNAs to c-Jun or p65, MSCs were plated in enriched DMEM medium for 24 hours. The cells were then transiently transfected with siRNA to c-Jun (60 nM, #L-003268-00; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA), siRNA to p65 (30 nM, #MU-003533-02; Dharmacon; kindly provided by Prof. Wiemann, DKFZ, Heidelberg Germany) or control siRNA (same concentrations) by Lipofectamine RNAiMAX\u2122 transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cells were washed and incubated in DMEM medium overnight, and then stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 (25 ng/ml; a suboptimal concentration of TNF-\u03b1 was used in order to facilitate detection of inhibitory effects) for 24 to 48 hours. Cell supernatants were collected for ELISA assays.MSC stimulation by CM derived from MDA-MB-231 cells, transfected with TNF-\u03b1-expressing vectorMDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector or with the same vector coding for human TNF-\u03b1, by ICAFectin\u2122 441 DNA transfection reagent (InCellArt, Nantes, France) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After 24 hours, Tumor CM was harvested and TNF-\u03b1 expression was determined by ELISA, as described below. In parallel, on the day of MDA-MB-231 cell transfection, MSCs were plated in enriched DMEM medium. The MSCs were then incubated for 24 hours with Tumor CM from MDA-MB-231 cells transfected by control vector or by TNF-\u03b1-expressing vector, or with enriched DMEM medium as control. Part of the above MDA-MB-231 Tumor CM was frozen in \u221220\u00b0C, as was also the case for CM of MSCs alone. All CM was then thawed at the same time (from MSCs stimulated with supernatants of MDA-MB-231 cells transfected by control vector or by TNF-\u03b1-expressing vector, from control MSCs and the CM of the tumor cells themselves). As appropriate, CCL2, CXCL8, CCL5 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in these supernatants were determined by ELISA.Stimulation of patient CAFs by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2CAFs #1 and CAFs #2 isolates were cultured for 24 hours in CAF growth medium (as above). The cells were then washed twice in LPM starvation medium (Biological Industries), and incubated for 48 hours in LPM starvation medium in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (500 pg/ml) or cytokine vehicle (as above). CCL5 levels in the supernatants of the cells were determined by ELISA.Confocal analysesHuman BM-derived MSCs that were grown in the absence of or in the presence of MDA-MB-231-derived or MCF-7-derived Tumor CM for ~30 days (as above) were cultured for 24 hours on sterilized cover slips at 37\u00b0C. The cells were washed, fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% triton, blocked with 2% BSA in PBS, and then incubated with antibodies against \u03b1SMA (#A-2547; Sigma-Aldrich) and vimentin (#sc-6260; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Negative controls included samples in which the primary antibodies were replaced by isotype-matched nonrelevant antibody controls (data not shown). The cells were then stained with the secondary antibodies, as appropriate. In parallel, cells were counterstained with the nuclear dye 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cell-coated cover slips were removed from the wells, embedded in mounting gel and imaged by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510; Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).Polymerase chain reactions (PCR)To determine the expression of human TNF receptors, total RNA was isolated by the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400-100; Biological Industries) from patient CAFs #1 and CAFs #2 isolates, from MSCs and from HL-60 cells that served as positive control. First-strand complementary DNA was generated using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The expression of TNF-RI (TNFRSF1A) and TNF-RII (TNFRSF1B) was determined using the following primers: TNF-RI, forward 5\u2032-GCACTGCCGCTGCCACACT-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-AAGGCGATCTCGCAGGACG-3\u2032, expected PCR product size 1,480 base pairs; and TNF-RII, forward 5\u2032-ATGGCGCCCGTCGCCGTCT-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-CCTGGTTAACTGGGCTTCATC-3\u2032, expected PCR product size 1,390 base pairs. PCR amplification of TNF-RI was performed over 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 90 seconds). PCR amplification of TNF-RII was performed over 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 65\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 90 seconds). The sequence of the resulting PCR products was verified as TNF-RI and TNR-II. No-template controls were negative.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assaysELISA assays were performed in the linear range of absorbance using standard curves generated with recombinant proteins. The ELISA for CCL2 involved mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human CCL2 (#500-M71; PeproTech) for coating, and biotinylated rabbit anti human CCL2 antibodies (#500-P34Bt; PeproTech) for detection. The ELISA for CXCL8 involved mouse mAbs against human CXCL8 (#511502; BioLegend) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human CXCL8 (#500-P28; PeproTech) for coating, and biotinylated goat anti human CXCL8 antibodies (#BAF208; R&D Systems) or biotinylated rabbit anti human CXCL8 antibodies (#500-P28Bt; PeproTech) for detection. The ELISA for CCL5 involved mouse mAbs against human CCL5 (#500-M75; PeproTech) for coating, and biotinylated goat anti human CCL5 antibodies (#BAF278; R&D Systems) for detection. The ELISA for TNF-\u03b1 involved mouse mAbs against human TNF-\u03b1 (#500-M26; PeproTech) for coating, and biotinylated rabbit anti human TNF-\u03b1 antibodies (#500-P31ABt; PeproTech) for detection. Following the addition of streptavidin\u2013horseradish peroxidase, the substrate TMB/E (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) was added. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4, and was measured at 450 nm.ImmunohistochemistryThe expression of CCL2 by CAFs in biopsies of patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was determined as described previously. Briefly, serial sections (5 \u03bcm thick) obtained from archived paraffin blocks of patients were processed and stained by antibodies against human CCL2. Staining was evaluated by a breast-cancer specialized pathologist.Western blottingTo determine the activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1 stimulation was carried out at time points that were determined by preliminary kinetics analyses (based on published literature and on our experience in other cell systems; data not shown). In all of the experiments described below, control cells were incubated with the relevant vehicles of the reagents. The following primary antibodies were used: phosphorylated p65 (#3033; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), total p65 (#4764; Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated c-Jun (#1527-s; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA), total c-Jun (#610326; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA) and I\u03baB\u03b1 (#4814; Cell Signaling Technology). To determine the characteristics of patient CAFs and of Tumor CM-derived CAFs, the following primary antibodies were used: pan-cytokeratin (#MA5-13203; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), \u03b1SMA (#A-2547; Sigma-Aldrich and #ab5694; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), vimentin (#sc-6260; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FSP1 (#ab12480; Abcam) and FAP\u03b1 (#sc-135069; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Loading controls were determined using antibodies against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; #ab9485; Abcam), \u03b2-tubulin (#ab6046; Abcam) and Erk (#sc-154; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as indicated in the figures. After washing, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies. In all cases, conventional western blot procedures were taken and membranes were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) solution and X-ray film.Migration of monocytic cellsMonocytic THP-1 cells were grown in suspension in enriched RPMI medium and their migration in response to CM of MSCs, stimulated or not stimulated by TNF-\u03b1, was determined. To this end, MSCs were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 24 hours, while control cells were exposed to the vehicle of the cytokine (0.1% BSA) in DMEM starvation medium. Supernatants from control and from stimulated cells were then collected and divided into groups as follows: supernatants from untreated control MSCs; supernatants from TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs, treated by neutralizing antibodies against CCL2 (2 \u03bcg/ml, #MAB679; R&D Systems); and supernatants from TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs, treated by isotype-matched nonrelevant antibody (2 \u03bcg/ml, #401201; BioLegend). Recombinant human CCL2 (rhCCL2) was used at 100 ng/ml as positive control in the migration assays. rhCCL2 was either untreated or treated by neutralizing antibodies against CCL2 (as above). All antibody treatments were performed for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The migration of human THP-1 monocytic cells in response to these cell supernatants was assessed by a 48-well modified Boyden chamber through a polycarbonate polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filter (8 \u03bcm pore size; Osmonics, Livermore, CA, USA). After 2 hours, the filters were fixed by methanol, and stained with a Diff-Quik kit (Dade Behring, Dudingen, Switzerland). The cells were counted in five high-power fields (HPF) by light microscopy in triplicate.Statistical analysesImpact of prolonged stimulation by Tumor CM on the release of inflammatory chemokines by the resulting CAFs. Human BM-derived MSCs were cultured with Tumor CM from MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA) (A) or MCF-7 cells (B) over a prolonged period of time (~30 days; MSCs + MDA CM or MSCs + MCF-7 CM, respectively). Twenty-four hours after medium exchange to fresh Tumor CM, cell supernatants were collected and the expression of CCL2 (A1, B1), CXCL8 (A2, B2) and CCL5 (A3, B3) was determined in comparison with supernatants of MSCs that were not supplemented with CM (MSCs) and with the original Tumor CM of MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells alone (MDA CM or MCF-7 CM, respectively). Chemokine expression was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. (A1), (A2), (B1) Representatives of n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results. (A3), (B2), (B3) Ratios between MSCs and MSCs + Tumor CM were not consistent in different experimental repeats. Therefore, in these panels, the findings are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of normalized values (MSCs were given the value of 1) obtained in relevant experimental repeats (at least n = 3).Student\u2019s t test was used to calculate P values for ELISAs and chemotaxis assays. P <0.05 was considered significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure. Using this procedure, all of the significant results that were presented in the manuscript remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity. The ELISA results presented in the paper show a representative experiment out of n \u2265 3 independent experiments that have shown similar trends. An exception is shown in Figure\u00a01A3,B2,B3, where the effect of Tumor CM on chemokine release was not consistent; therefore, in these cases, the results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the different experiments (MSCs were given the value of 1). The confocal pictures are representatives of many pictures that were taken in at least three independent experiments.Results and discussionThe effects of long-term stimulation of MSCs by Tumor CM on the inflammatory nature of the resulting CAFsPublished reports indicate that prolonged stimulation of BM-derived human MSCs with breast tumor-derived factors (Tumor CM) has led to conversion of MSCs into functional CAFs that promoted tumor growth. We began this study by determining the influence of such tumor-derived factors on the inflammatory traits of CAFs generated by MSCs exposed to Tumor CM, using the expression of the inflammatory/pro-malignancy chemokines CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 as readouts. To this end, we followed our published procedure on generation of CAFs that are functional in vivo in promoting breast cancer, by stimulating MSCs with Tumor CM for ~30 days. Following such stimulation with Tumor CM of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast tumor cells, the resulting cells have undergone conversion to CAF-like cells (to be termed herein CAFs), as expected (Figure S2 in Additional file 1).The generation of such CAFs by Tumor CM has been only partly accompanied by enhanced inflammatory profile of the resulting CAFs. Tumor CM of MDA-MB-231 cells has increased the release of CCL2 and CXCL8 but not of CCL5 (Figure\u00a01A), while Tumor CM of MCF-7 cells did not promote the release of CXCL8 and CCL5 by the Tumor CM-generated CAFs (Figure\u00a01B2,B3) and downregulated the expression of CCL2 by the cells (Figure\u00a01B1). These results indicate that when CAFs are generated by exposure to breast tumor-derived factors, the process leads to only marginal increases in the inflammatory phenotype of the resulting CAFs. Moreover, only the CM of the more aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells upregulated chemokine production by the resulting CAFs, revealing heterogeneity in the content of the factors produced by different breast tumor cells and in their impact on the expression of inflammatory traits by CAFs. The content of Tumor CM is complex (for example); thus, the identity of the factors regulating the expression of the different chemokines is yet to be explored and the question of whether these same factors also induce the conversion of MSCs to CAFs needs to be addressed in future studies.TNF-\u03b1 prominently induces the release of pro-cancerous chemokines by Tumor CM-generated CAFs and by patient CAFsTNF-\u03b1 induces potent elevation in inflammatory traits in MSCs and Tumor-CM-generated CAFs. Human BM-derived MSCs were cultured with Tumor CM from MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA) (A) or from MCF-7 cells (B) over a prolonged period of time (~30 days). TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) or its vehicle (in control cells) was added for the last 24 hours. Expression of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 was then determined in supernatants of the cells. (A) Expression of the chemokines in the four experimental groups included in the study: MSCs grown in culture for ~30 days without any additional stimulus (MSCs); MSCs grown in culture for ~30 days in the presence of Tumor CM derived from MDA-MB-231 cells (MSCs + MDA CM); MSCs grown in culture for ~30 days and stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 at the last 24 hours of culture (MSCs + TNF-\u03b1); and MSCs grown in culture for ~30 days in the presence of Tumor CM derived from MDA-MB-231 cells and stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 at the last 24 hours of culture (MSCs + MDA CM + TNF-\u03b1). Expression of CCL2 (A1), CXCL8 (A2) and CCL5 (A3) was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. (B) Experimental design as in (A), but with MCF-7-derived CM. In each panel, the findings are representatives of at least n = 3 experiments that have shown similar results. In comparisons between MSCs and all other groups: *P <0.05, **P \u22640.01, ***P \u22640.001. NS, not significant. #Differences between the two indicated groups have shown variability in n \u2265 3 independent experiments and overall were not significant.TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are highly expressed by cancer cells of patients in human breast tumors (and also by adjacent stromal cells and leukocytes). Of the two cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 is of particular interest because of its divergent and at times opposing roles in the TME, and also because it induces the release of inflammatory chemokines by breast tumor cells and normal tissue cells (for example). Also, as we show in Figure S3 in Additional file 1, the expression of TNF-RI and TNF-RII was denoted in MSCs. Thus, we questioned what is the impact of TNF-\u03b1 on the inflammatory traits of CAFs derived from MSCs stimulated by Tumor CM. Breast tumor cells are known to lose in culture the capacity to release endogenous inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (lack of endogenous TNF-\u03b1 expression is shown in Figure S4 in Additional file 1, under nontransfected and control vector cells; results for IL-1\u03b2 are not shown). Therefore, we have used exogenous TNF-\u03b1 for stimulating the CAFs that were generated from MSCs by Tumor CM. We then determined the release of the inflammatory chemokines by the stimulated cells (Figure\u00a02).To determine the effects of TNF-\u03b1 stimulation on Tumor CM-generated CAFs, MSCs that were exposed to Tumor CM for ~30 days were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 during the last 24 hours of culture (MSCs + MDA CM + TNF-\u03b1 or MSCs + MCF-7 CM + TNF-\u03b1) followed by determination of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 expression in cell supernatants. In parallel, chemokine expression was determined in MSCs that were exposed to Tumor CM alone for the same prolonged time period (MSCs + MDA CM or MSCs + MCF-7 CM) and in MSCs that were grown in culture for ~30 days without Tumor CM and were then stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 during the last 24 hours (MSCs + TNF-\u03b1). The results shown in Figure\u00a02 demonstrate that when CAFs were generated by prolonged exposure of MSCs to Tumor CM, the resulting CAFs responded to TNF-\u03b1 by elevated release of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5. In parallel, stimulation of MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 has also induced the release of the three chemokines (Figure\u00a02). However, there were no significant differences in chemokine levels induced by stimulation of Tumor CM-generated CAFs with TNF-\u03b1 when compared with stimulation of MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 (two right-hand bars in Figure\u00a02). These results indicate that Tumor CM did not cooperate with TNF-\u03b1 in upregulating chemokine release and did not have much of an added value. TNF-\u03b1 thus had a dominant role in inducing the inflammatory traits in Tumor CM-generated CAFs and in MSCs. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 induced the release of the inflammatory chemokines even when the Tumor CM alone (as shown in Figure\u00a01 for CCL5 stimulation by MDA CM and for CXCL8 and CCL5 stimulation by MCF-7 CM) had no effect. These results indicate that the different chemokines are commonly regulated by TNF\u03b1, unlike their differential response to breast Tumor CM.These findings suggest that, following their recruitment to the tumor site, MSCs are exposed to tumor constituents that promote their differentiation to CAFs and to some extent can also elevate their ability to release pro-malignancy chemokines. However, since the TME is enriched with TNF-\u03b1 released by the tumor cells, this inflammatory cytokine turns into a most powerful inducer of chemokine release by CAFs. TNF-\u03b1 thus enriches the TME with high levels of inflammatory/tumor-promoting chemokines presenting many deleterious pro-cancerous effects.Basal and cytokine-induced release of inflammatory chemokines by patient CAFs. CAFs were isolated from lung metastasis of a breast cancer patient (CAFs #1) or from a primary tumor of a different breast cancer patient (CAFs #2). (A1, B1) Expression of the pro-malignancy chemokines CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. (A2, B2) Expression of CCL5 was determined following TNFa and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation (TNF-\u03b1, 50 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2, 500 pg/ml; 48 hours). Control cells were stimulated by vehicle. Expression of the chemokines was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. In all panels, the findings are representatives of at least n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.To examine the potential clinical relevance of these observations we tested the content of inflammatory chemokines in CAFs obtained directly from a lung metastasis of a breast cancer patient (CAFs #1) and from a different patient\u2019s primary breast tumor (CAFs #2). Two such CAF isolates showed production of CCL2 and of CXCL8 (Figure\u00a03A1 and 3B1, respectively). Both patient CAF isolates did not secrete CCL5 (Figure\u00a03A1,B1).To better understand the regulation of chemokine release by patient CAFs, we asked whether CCL5 \u2013 which was not released constitutively by these cells \u2013 would be upregulated by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 that are known to prevail at the TME of breast tumors. Indeed, in line with the expression of both TNF-RI and TNF-RII by the two patient CAF isolates (Figure S3 in Additional file 1), both isolates responded to TNF-\u03b1 with increased release of CCL5 (Figure\u00a03A2,B2). Similar upregulation of CCL5 expression was observed after stimulation by IL-1\u03b2 (Figure\u00a03A2,B2), suggesting that chemokine induction by inflammatory cytokines may be a general effect and not necessarily limited to TNF-\u03b1. These findings support the clinical relevance of our previous findings, showing that TNF-\u03b1 upregulated CCL5 in CAFs generated from MSCs by MDA Tumor CM (Figure\u00a02A3) and by MCF-7 Tumor CM (Figure\u00a02B3), and suggest that they reflect the clinical conditions of breast cancer.Overall, the results obtained in this part of the study indicate that while tumor constituents had marginal effects on the inflammatory traits of Tumor CM-generated CAFs, the effects of the inflammatory microenvironment \u2013 represented here by TNF-\u03b1 \u2013 were more prominent and may lead to pronounced upregulation of inflammatory chemokines in the TME. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 highly prevail in breast tumors, and thus the inflammatory phenotype gained by patient CAFs in response to such inflammatory cytokines may form the basis of inflammation\u2013stroma associations that promote breast cancer progression in patient tumors.TNF-\u03b1 amplifies the inflammatory phenotype of MSCs by activating TNF-RI and TNF-RIITNF-\u03b1 upregulates the inflammatory profile of MSCs via receptors TNF-RI and TNF-RII. (A) Relative induction of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 in MSCs by TNF-\u03b1. Human BM-derived MSCs were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 24 hours and the expression of the inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 in supernatants of MSCs was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. Results are from an experiment in which all three chemokines were analyzed in parallel, and the ratios between the three chemokines are representatives of the values obtained in many experimental repeats. (B) Human BM-derived MSCs were exposed to neutralizing antibodies against tumor necrosis factor receptors TNF-RI and TNF-RII or nonrelevant isotype-matched control antibodies (Control Ab) 1 hour prior to stimulation with TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml), and in the course of 24 hours of stimulation by the cytokine. Control, cells stimulated with vehicle. Expression of CCL2 was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. The findings are representatives of at least n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.MSCs that populate tumors are candidates for activation by inflammatory factors that are present at the TME. The findings shown in Figure\u00a04A indicate that, following stimulation by TNF-\u03b1, CXCL8 was the chemokine most prominently induced in MSCs, followed by CCL2 and then CCL5, which underwent relatively low levels of induction. Moreover, the elevations in CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 production obtained in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs were recapitulated by CM of MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells that were transfected to express TNF-\u03b1 (Figure S5 in Additional file 1). Specifically, TNF-\u03b1 expression by the tumor cells led to prominent upregulation of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 production by MSCs (Figure S5 in Additional file 1). The inflammatory impact was not limited to TNF-\u03b1 but was also detected following stimulation of MSCs by exogenous IL-1\u03b2 (Figure S6 in Additional file 1). Overall, all three chemokines \u2013 CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 \u2013 were induced in MSCs by the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, suggesting that they all may be upregulated in the TME by inflammatory mediators that are highly prevalent at breast tumor sites.CCL2 is expressed by CAFs localized in vicinity to breast cancer cells in tumors of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients. CCL2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in biopsy sections of patients diagnosed with IDC: (A) IDC #1, (B) IDC #2. CCL2 staining was detected in cancer cells and in adjacent fibroblasts. Some of the CCL2-expressing CAFs are indicated by arrows.Of the three chemokines induced in MSCs by TNF-\u03b1, CCL2 was of most interest to us. This chemokine is highly versatile and promotes the inflammatory and pro-cancerous nature of the TME by acting at many divergent levels, not all shared by CXCL8 and CCL5. Furthermore, CCL2 has very high relevance to our current study because we discovered that it was expressed by CAFs residing in proximity to human cancer cells in biopsies of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients (Figure\u00a05). To further understand the molecular mechanisms mediating inflammation\u2013stroma interactions, we focused on the mechanisms mediating the process of TNF-\u03b1-induced CCL2 secretion by MSCs. Using neutralizing antibodies to TNF-RI and to TNF-RII, the secretion of CCL2 was significantly inhibited compared with isotype-treated controls (Figure\u00a04B; inhibition of TNF-RI gave rise to 36 to 55% reduction in CCL2 secretion and inhibition of TNF-RII to 34 to 54% reduction), indicating that both receptors mediate the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on CCL2 release by MSCs (based on analyses combining the two antibodies at different concentrations (data not shown), we believe that the inhibition levels could not reach higher levels due to insufficient neutralizing activities of the antibodies). These findings are of major interest because TNF-RI is abundant in most cell types, while the expression of TNF-RII is not as promiscuous but nevertheless was found to be upregulated in breast cancer.Induction of inflammatory traits in MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 is tightly regulated by the NF-\u03baB pathwayInduction of CCL2 and CLXL8 in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MSCs is not mediated via the AP-1 pathway. (A) Human BM-derived MSCs were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 5 and 10 minutes. Control cells were treated by the vehicle of TNF-\u03b1. c-Jun levels and phosphorylation were determined by western blot (WB) analyses. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as loading control. (B) Human BM-derived MSCs were transiently transfected by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to c-Jun or by control siRNA. (B1) c-Jun expression was determined by WB analyses. \u03b2-Tubulin was used as loading control. (B2) Following siRNA transfection, the cells were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (25 ng/ml; in this part of the study we used a suboptimal concentration of TNF-\u03b1 in order to facilitate detection of inhibitory effects) for 24 hours. Expression levels of CCL2 and CXCL8 in the supernatants of the cells were determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. #siRNA to c-Jun has yielded minor increases or reductions in CCL2 and CXCL8 secretion in different experiments (see Results and discussion), and thus overall there was no significant effect on CCL2 and CXCL8 secretion. In all panels, the findings are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.The AP-1 and NF-\u03baB transcription factors are known to induce the expression of inflammatory chemokines in the immune context; however, their extent of involvement in inducing such chemokines depends on the cell type and stimulus. From the therapeutic perspective it is crucial to know whether both or only one of these transcription factors are mediating the response of MSCs to inflammatory stimuli that give rise to increased production of pro-malignancy chemokines. We began this part of the study by determining the involvement of AP-1 in induction of CCL2 and CXCL8, the two inflammatory chemokines that we found to be most relevant to the clinical setting, as shown by their expression by patient CAF isolates #1 and #2 (Figure\u00a03). While AP-1 was activated by TNF-\u03b1 stimulation of MSCs, it did not play a role in inducing CCL2 and CXCL8 (Figure\u00a06). Specifically, in response to TNF-\u03b1, c-Jun \u2013 the active component of AP-1 \u2013 was rapidly induced in MSCs (possibly due to elevated stability), as was the phosphorylated form of c-Jun (Figure\u00a06A). However, downregulation of c-Jun expression by siRNA (Figure\u00a06B1) did not lead to reduction in CCL2 and CXCL8 expression following TNF-\u03b1 stimulation (Figure\u00a06B2; impact on CCL2 was in the range of 21% inhibition to 33% increase and for CXCL8 was in the range of 29% inhibition to 27% increase).NF-\u03baB is essential in mediating TNF-\u03b1-induced release of chemokines by MSCs. (A) Human BM-derived MSCs were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 15 minutes. The levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 (the negative regulator of the NF-\u03baB pathway) were determined by WB analyses. GAPDH was used as a loading control throughout. (B) CAFs were generated by culturing MSCs with Tumor CM from MDA-MB-231 (MDA) or MCF-7 breast tumor cells over a prolonged period of time (~30 days). TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) was added for the last 24 hours to MSCs + Tumor CM cells and I\u03baB\u03b1 levels were determined by WB analyses. (C) CAF #1 cells were stimulated for 48 hours by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml). I\u03baB\u03b1 levels were determined by WB analyses. (D) Human BM-derived MSCs were stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 10 minutes. p65 phosphorylation was determined by WB analyses. (E) Human BM-derived MSCs were transiently transfected by siRNA to p65 or by control siRNA. (E1) p65 expression was determined by WB analyses. (E2) Following siRNA transfection, the cells were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (25 ng/ml; a suboptimal concentration of TNF-\u03b1 in order to facilitate detection of inhibitory effects) for 48 hours. Expression of CCL2 and CXCL8 in the supernatants of the cells was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. In all panels, the findings are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.Different results were obtained for NF-\u03baB, showing that this transcription factor is cardinal in CCL2 and CXCL8 upregulation by TNF-\u03b1 in MSCs. First, we found that TNF-\u03b1 stimulation induced significant reduction in the expression levels of I\u03baB\u03b1, the negative regulator of the NF-\u03baB pathway, in MSCs (Figure\u00a07A). Similar results were obtained in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated Tumor CM-derived CAFs, as well as in patient CAFs (Figure\u00a07B,C). In parallel, p65 was activated by TNF-\u03b1 stimulation of MSCs (Figure\u00a07D) and direct roles for NF-\u03baB in CCL2 and CXCL8 induction were revealed when p65 was downregulated by siRNA to p65 (Figure\u00a07E1). Specifically, p65 knockdown by siRNA resulted in almost complete inhibition of CCL2 (78 to 88%) and CXCL8 (82 to 90%) release by TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs (Figure\u00a07E2).In contrast to the results obtained with TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, a different pattern was obtained with regards to the impact of Tumor CM on the cells: while factors released by tumor cells resulted in MSC conversion to CAFs (Figure S2 in Additional file 1) and to elevated release of some of the inflammatory chemokines (Figure\u00a01), no activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway was observed in MSCs exposed to Tumor CM (Figure\u00a07B). Here, we need to take into account the fact that the cells were exposed to Tumor CM for 1 month and thus it is possible that the rapid NF-\u03baB activation signals could no longer be detected.To summarize, the results of this part of the study clearly indicate an NF-\u03baB-based pathway that regulates the expression of inflammatory and pro-malignancy chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL8 in MSCs and in CAFs in response to TNF-\u03b1. NF-\u03baB, but not AP-1, was involved in TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory patterns of CAFs and MSCs, despite the fact that the promoter domains of both these chemokines contain binding sites for c-Jun. This dichotomy between the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors in controlling CCL2 and CXCL8 production in MSCs indicates that the inflammatory profile of MSCs is tightly regulated. The preference of one transcription factor over another needs to be considered when potential therapeutic measures are directed to intracellular components involved in inflammation-induced tumor progression, such as NF-\u03baB and AP-1.The inflammatory traits gained by MSCs following stimulation by TNF-\u03b1 lead to potential pro-cancerous effectsThus far, we have demonstrated that the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced inflammatory traits in CAFs and MSCs; furthermore, we have delineated the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes. To follow on these observations, we asked whether the inflammatory traits induced by TNF-\u03b1 in MSCs have functional relevance to tumor-promoting events taking place at the TME.MSCs promote monocyte migration through TNF-\u03b1-induced secretion of CCL2. Supernatants (sups) were collected from human BM-derived MSCs that were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) or by its vehicle for 24 hours. Thereafter, the sups were incubated with neutralizing antibodies for CCL2 or with nonrelevant isotype-matched control antibody (I.C.) for 30 minutes. The migration of monocytic cells in response to control medium (without chemokine), to recombinant human CCL2 (rhCCL2; 100 ng/ml) or to sups from TNF-\u03b1-stimulated or TNF-\u03b1 nonstimulated MSCs was determined by Boyden chamber migration assays. Cells were counted under a high-power field (HPF). The findings are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.CCL2 induces the recruitment to tumors of myeloid subpopulations that exert prominent pro-cancerous effects, including TAMs and MDSCs. We examined the in vitro migration of monocytic cells and found that it was induced by supernatants of TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs (Figure\u00a08), which have been previously found to be enriched with CCL2 (Figures\u00a02 and 4A). Furthermore, this migratory response was absolutely dependent on CCL2 because neutralization of this chemokine abolished the increase in monocytic cell migration in response to supernatants derived from TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs (Figure\u00a08). These results suggest that TNF-\u03b1, which is prevalent in the TME, acts on MSCs that reside in the tumors, leading to high production of CCL2 by these cells. This chemokine, in turn, may induce the recruitment of deleterious myeloid infiltrates to the tumor and thus further promote the malignant phenotype of the tumor. Chemokine pro-cancerous activities may thus not only be initiated by the tumor cells directly, but may also be induced by inflammatory factors of the TME acting on stromal cells residing in proximity to the cancer cells.Furthermore, our findings suggesting that MSC-derived CCL2 promotes the recruitment of TAMs and MDSCs to breast tumors emphasize the important roles of inflammation\u2013stroma interactions. These findings gain high relevance with the fact that CCL2 is indeed expressed in breast cancer cells, as we have shown in our study of biopsies of invasive ductal carcinoma patients (Figure\u00a05).ConclusionsMuch prominence has been given to inflammation-driven activities that promote tumor progression by acting on cancer cells, infiltrating leukocytes and adjacent stromal cells. In the current study we provide new findings on the networks that control the inflammatory phenotype of CAFs and MSCs, demonstrating key roles for the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in upregulating the release of inflammatory, tumor-promoting chemokines by these two cell types.TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are highly relevant to the inflammatory setup of breast tumors. They are minimally expressed by normal breast epithelial cells while their expression by breast tumor cells was detected in ~85% of breast tumors in patients; elevated incidence of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression was highly correlated with relapsed and advanced disease. In the current study we found that TNF-\u03b1 upregulated the inflammatory phenotype of Tumor CM-derived CAFs and patient-derived CAFs, manifested by the increased release of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 which are inflammatory chemokines having strong tumor-promoting activities in general and in breast cancer, particularly when derived from stroma cells. TNF-\u03b1 was also demonstrated to be a key inducer of inflammatory characteristics in MSCs, with activities that were much more pronounced and general than those induced by tumor constituents (Tumor CM). As a result of TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, the stromal cells acquired the ability to release high levels of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5. The increased release of these chemokines from CAFs and MSCs may lead to exacerbated inflammatory and pro-cancerous nature of the TME and, based on our results (Figure\u00a08), may lead to increased levels of deleterious myeloid infiltrates in breast tumors. The findings of our study thus suggest that stromal cells located near the cancer cells have a major role in promoting the inflammatory nature of the TME. Overall, a coordinated inflammatory network may be established at the tumor site between the cancer cells and stromal cells, set up by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.In this study we have also revealed the important role of NF-\u03baB, but not of AP-1, in mediating the activities of TNF-\u03b1 on MSCs and CAFs. These findings support other reports, indicating that the NF-\u03baB pathway is a key cellular component that controls inflammatory events at the TME. The ultimate need for NF-\u03baB activation in this process provides novel insights into specificity in regulatory pathways and may thus have clinical therapeutic implications. This need shows that NF-\u03baB may be a preferred target for inhibition and that its roles are not limited to the tumor cells themselves and to infiltrating leukocytes, but rather extend to stromal cells at the tumor milieu. Thus, our study strongly supports the positioning of NF-\u03baB as a master regulator that may serve as a therapeutic target, whose inhibition may lead to significant downregulation of inflammatory, pro-cancerous events in the entire tumor.Currently, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB in cancer has not entered the stage of clinical trials, and may be hampered by the fact that this pathway regulates a number of essential cellular processes and immune activities. Such hurdles can be overcome by directing the NF-\u03baB-inhibiting modalities to specific target cells, in which this transcription factor is the key inducer of undesired inflammatory, tumor-promoting effects. In this respect, the results of our study imply that MSCs and CAFs could serve as appropriate targets for NF-\u03baB inhibition, through which downregulation of the inflammatory TME could be achieved.Additional fileAbbreviations\u03b1SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinBMbone marrowBSAbovine serum albuminCAFcancer-associated fibroblastCMconditioned mediumDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFAP\u03b1fibroblast activation protein alphaFBSfetal bovine serumFSP1fibroblast specific protein 1GAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHPFhigh power fieldILinterleukinIDCinvasive ductal carcinomamAbmonoclonal antibodyMDSCmyeloid-derived suppressor cellMSCmesenchymal stem/stromal cellNFnuclear factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNATAMtumor-associated macrophageTMEtumor microenvironmentTNF-\u03b1tumor necrosis factor alphaTNF-Rtumor necrosis factor receptorWBwestern blotChristina Katanov, Shalom Lerrer, Debabrata Banerjee and Adit Ben-Baruch contributed equally to this work.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors\u2019 contributionsCK and SL were the major contributors to the acquisition of data and performed most of the experiments included in the study.

        "content": "Accumulating evidence suggests that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit the growth of breast tumors by inhibiting the synthesis of estrogen. However, it remains unknown whether the aromatase inhibitor letrozole has an additional impact on CAFs, which further influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Primary CAFs were isolated from primary estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumors. Estrogen-deprived culture medium was used to exclude the influence of steroids. In co-culture, primary cultured CAFs increased MCF7 cell adhesion, invasion, migration and proliferation, and letrozole treatment inhibited these increases, except for the increase in proliferation. In total, 258 up-regulated genes and 47 down-regulated genes with an absolute fold change &gt;2 were identified in CAFs co-cultured with MCF7 cell after letrozole treatment. One up-regulated genes (POSTN) and seven down-regulated genes (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, IL-8, CXCL5, LEP and NGF) were further validated by real-time PCR. The changes in CCL2 and CXCL1 expression were further confirmed using an automated microscopic imaging-based, high content analysis platform. Although the results need further functional validation, this study is the first to describe the differential tumor-promoting phenotype of CAFs induced by letrozole and the associated gene expression alterations. Most importantly, our data revealed that down-regulation of several secreted factors (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1 etc.) in CAFs might be partially responsible for the efficacy of letrozole. ",

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

        "title": "Targeting multiple tyrosine kinase receptors with Dovitinib blocks invasion and the interaction between tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer.",
        "content": "A constitutive and dynamic interaction between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma is a prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (collectively called cancer associated fibroblasts, CAFs) often represent the major cellular components of tumor stroma. Tumor cells secret different growth factors which induce CAFs proliferation and differentiation, and, consequently, CAFs secrete different chemokines, cytokines or growth factors which induce tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In this study we showed here that CAFs from breast cancer surgical specimens significantly induced the invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Most interestingly, the novel multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dovitinib significantly blocked the CAFs-induced invasion of breast cancer cells by, at least in part, inhibition of the expression and secretion of CCL2, CCL5 and VEGF in CAFs. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could be responsible for the effects of Dovitinib, since Dovitinib antagonized the promoted phosphorylated Akt after treatment with PDGF, FGF or breast cancer cell-conditioned media. Treatment with Dovitinib in combination with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitors Ly294002 or RAD001 resulted in additive inhibition of cell invasion. This is the first in vitro study to show that the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor has therapeutic activities against breast cancer metastasis by targeting both tumor cells and CAFs. ",

With rapid advances in BC treatment, better clinical outcomes have been achieved. Nevertheless, metastasis is still the main cause of death for BC patients, with a median overall survival of only 2-3 years. The premetastatic niche (PMN) created by primary tumors in a specific secondary organ is crucial to the subsequent colonization and metastasis of tumor cells, including vascular permeability and angiogenesis, immunosuppression, inflammation, reprogramming and organotropism. Moreover, the initial stages of PMN formation are characterized by angiogenesis and vascular permeability. The function and mechanism of blood vessels in primary tumor sites have been well studied, but little is known about the changes in blood vessels in secondary metastasis sites. Several PMN biomarkers related to angiogenesis and vascular permeability have been reported to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of metastatic cancer. However, the mechanisms regulating PMN formation are complex and have their own characteristics in different tumors. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of PMN formation in a tumor may provide useful insights and valuable strategies for the treatment of metastatic cancer.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major stromal component of the tumor microenvironment, are critical to tumor development. Our and other previous studies have shown that CAFs can promote cancer growth and metastasis by secreting cytokines and exosomes, synthetizing and remodeling the extracellular matrix, and metabolic remodeling in the primary tumor microenvironment. CAFs are also major players in angiogenesis by secreting cytokines, including VEGFA, PDGFC, SDF1, WNT2, and WNT5a. However, little is known about whether primary CAFs can affect metastasis in distant organs. Recently, CAFs have been reported to increase the permeability of lymphatic and brain endothelial cells to facilitate cholangiocarcinoma cells and BC cells crossing the vascular endothelial layer, leading to colonization in the brain. Another interesting study showed that primary CAFs can deliver integrin \u03b21-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs) to lung fibroblasts to cause lung metastasis. These studies indicate that CAFs in the primary tumor can affect metastatic formation, but the details remain unknown.Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to RNAs that are longer than 200 nucleotides and exhibit non-encoding functions. Accumulating evidence over the past decade has indicated that lncRNAs are implicated in multiple pathophysiological processes, including proliferation, metastasis, drug resistance, stemness, metabolism, immune escape and angiogenesis. LncRNAs specifically interact with DNA, RNA, and proteins depending on their localization to modulate chromatin function, regulate cytoplasmic mRNA stability and translation, or interfere with signaling pathways. However, the underlying functions and mechanisms of stromal lncRNAs in CAFs remain poorly understood.In this study, we identified a significantly upregulated lncSNHG5 in primary breast CAFs, which plays an essential role in PMN formation via vascular leakage and angiogenesis. lncSNHG5 can interact with IGF2BP2 to augment the stability of ZNF281 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner. The enhanced ZNF281 transcriptionally regulates CCL2 and CCL5 expression in CAFs, which then activates P38 MAPK signaling in endothelial cells to induce PMN formation in the metastatic environment.Material and MethodsClinical samplesThe human paired breast cancer tissue and paracancerous tissue used in this study were collected from breast cancer patients, all of whom had not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy at the First Affiliated Hospital and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The investigation was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University.Isolation, immortalization and cell culture of stromal fibroblastsCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their corresponding normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from BC tissues and immortalized, as described in our previous study. CAFs and NFs were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Australia) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Australia) and placed in incubators containing 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A) and breast cancer cells (SK-BR-3, MCF-7, Hs578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The above cells were all cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Australia) with 10% FBS in a 5% CO2 standard humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C.LncRNA microarray and RNA sequencingLncRNAs in CAFs and NFs were analyzed using the Agilent SBC human lncRNA Microarray V5 (4*180K), which was performed by Shanghai Biotechnology Corporation. The microarray data are presented in the Supplementary File.Total RNA was extracted from NFs/Ctrl and NFs/lncSNHG5. Then, RNA was purified through rRNA depletion and subsequently used for cDNA synthesis and RNA amplification. Next, random hexamer primer cDNA libraries were sequenced on the DNBSEQ-T7 sequencing platform according to the manufacturer's instructions for paired-end 150 bp reads (Lifegenes, Shanghai, China). HTSeq v0.13.5 was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene. Differential expression analysis of two samples was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.26.0). The raw RNA-seq data were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive database (SRA; Identifiers: SRP392164).Bioinformatics analysesFor Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the clusterProfiler R package (v3.12.0). For Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, KOBAS v3.0 software was implemented to test the statistical enrichment of differentially expressed genes in KEGG pathways. GO or KEGG terms with P values less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by differentially expressed genes. GSEA was performed using GSEA 4.0.3 software and the functional gene sets defined by GSEA websites (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/downloads.jsp) to analyze the TCGA-BRCA dataset according to the levels of gene expression.Reagents, RNA interference and plasmidsThe following reagents were used in our work: rCCL2 and rCCL5 (R&D Systems, USA), axitinib (Selleck, USA), RS102895 (Selleck, USA), maraviroc (Selleck, USA), cenicriviroc (Selleck, USA), and SB203580 (Selleck, USA).To construct the engineered cells with stable knockdown or overexpression of target genes, the lentivirus carrying shRNA against lncSNHG5, ZNF281, IGF2BP2, CCL2 and CCL5 and lentiviral lncSNHG5-, ZNF281-, IGF2BP2-, CCL2- and CCL5-overexpressing constructs and their controls were infected into CAFs or NFs according to the manufacturer's instructions. The shRNA sequences are provided in Table S1.Full-length and deletion mutants of IGF2BP2 (FL, T1, T2 and T3) were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pcDNA3.1-Flag-tagged plasmid. The 5\u2032-UTR, CDS, and 3\u2032-UTR of ZNF281 were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector with biotin RNA labeling. The primer sequences used for plasmid construction are listed in Table S2.RNA preparation and qRT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted with TRIzol and then reverse transcribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, China). A SYBR Premix Ex Taq\u2122 II Kit (TaKaRa, China) was used to perform quantitative real-time PCR for the amplification of cDNA. The relative gene expression level was measured by the 2-\u0394\u0394CT method and normalized to \u03b2-actin expression. The primer sequences used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S3.Western blotting and ELISAsTotal protein was extracted by lysing whole cells or tissues in RIPA lysis buffer (Boster, China), and the protease inhibitor PMSF (Boster, China) was added to prevent protein degradation. A total of 50-80 \u03bcg protein was separated using 8-12% SDS-PAGE gel and electrically transferred to 0.22 \u03bcM PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, USA), which was blocked with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 3 h and then incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight with the special primary antibodies: Occludin (Abcam, ab216327, 1:1000), ZO-1 (Cell Signaling, #8193, 1:1000), ZNF281 (SAB, #43566, 1:1000), IGF2BP2 (Proteintech, 11601-1-AP, 1:2000), VEGFA (Abcam, ab1316, 1:1000), CCL2 (SAB, #45065, 1:500), CCL5 (SAB, #32935, 1:500), p-AKT (CST, #12694, 1:1000), AKT (CST, #9272, 1:1000), p-STAT3 (CST, #9131, 1:500), STAT3 (CST, #4904, 1:500), p-P38 (CST, #4631, 1:500), P38 (CST, #9212, 1:1000), p-VEGFR2 (Sangon, D155165, 1:800), VEGFR2 (Sangon, D151118, 1:800), and \u03b2-Actin (Biosharp, 1:1000). The PVDF membranes were incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature, followed by visualization of the protein bands using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with ECL detection reagents (Bio-Rad, USA). Protein concentrations of CCL2, CCL5 and VEGFA were measured in CM derived from CAFs or NFs or serum from healthy donors and BC patients using ELISA kits (R&D, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)The cellular localization of lncSNHG5 in CAFs was detected using a fluorescence in situ hybridization kit and FISH probe (GenePharma, China) following the manufacturer's protocol. Next, CAFs were incubated with Cy3-labeled lncSNHG5 probes at 4 \u00b0C overnight, after which DAPI was utilized to stain the nuclei. Images were taken using a confocal microscope.Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionationCytoplasmic and nuclear RNA from CAFs was extracted using the PARISTM Kit (Invitrogen, USA). GAPDH mRNA and U6 RNA were used as internal controls for cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA, respectively. Cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA were further quantified by qRT\u2010PCR.Immunohistochemistry (IHC)The paraffin-embedded tumor tissues obtained from nude mice and breast cancer patients were sectioned at a thickness of 4 \u00b5m. After being deparaffinized with xylene, dehydrated, and incubated with 10% goat serum for antigen retrieval, the tissue sections were subsequently incubated with CD31 (Abcam, ab9498, 1:100) and ZNF281 (SAB, #43566, 1:200) primary antibodies for 1 h and then with HRP secondary antibody for 20 min at room temperature. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used to stain the tissue sections. The IHC images were visualized and captured under an Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon, Japan).Preparation of conditioned medium (CM)CAFs or NFs (1\u00d7106) were plated in a 6-well plate. The growth medium with serum was replaced by 1 mL of serum-free medium, and the cells were further cultured for nearly 30 h. Following centrifugation at 500 rpm for 5 min, the collected supernatant was used as CM for subsequent experiments.Three-dimensional sprouting and tube formation assaysFor tube formation assays, HUVECs were plated in a 96-well plate precoated with growth factor-deprived Matrigel and cultured in 150 \u00b5L CM for 6 h. Images were captured using a microscope and analyzed using ImageJ. For three-dimensional sprouting assays, 1\u00d7103 HUVECs were cultured in 0.24% carboxymethylcellulose medium in round-bottom 96-well plates for 24 h. Spheroids of suspended endothelial cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended with collagen type I (Corning, USA) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Then, the three-dimensional collagen gels were incubated with the indicated CM for more than 24 h. The sprouting capacity of HUVECs was assessed by counting the number of branches under a microscope with at least 10 spheroids per group.In vitro permeability assays and trans-endothelial invasion assaysFor in vitro permeability assays, HUVECs were treated with supernatant from CAFs or NFs for 48 h to form an endothelial monolayer, and then rhodamine B-dextran was added to the upper layer of the transwell filters (0.4 \u03bcm, Corning). After 30 min, the medium in the lower layer of the chamber was collected to measure the fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence was detected at 544 nm excitation and 590 nm emission. For trans-endothelial invasion assays, 2\u00d7104 GFP-labeled Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into transwell filters (8 \u03bcm, BD Biosciences) with endothelial cell monolayers pretreated with CM. After 14 h, the Hs578T or MDA-MB-231 cells in the upper layer of the chamber were removed, while those labeled with GFP in the lower layer were observed and counted under a fluorescence microscope.RNA stability assaysCAFs or NFs were treated with actinomycin D (10 \u00b5g/mL) to block mRNA transcription. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol at the designated time. The mRNA levels of ZNF281 were evaluated using qRT-PCR, and \u03b2-actin served as the internal reference.RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assaysFull-length antisense or sense lncSNHG5 was transcribed using a T7 in vitro Transcription Kit (Roche, USA) following the manufacturer's procedures. Biotinylated lncSNHG5 or ZNF281, which was bound to streptavidin-labeled agarose beads (Invitrogen), was incubated with whole-cell lysates of CAFs. Then, the bead-bound complexes of RNA and protein were carefully eluted with elution buffer. The eluted proteins were used for silver staining and mass spectrometry or WB.For antisense DNA probe pull-down assays, antisense or sense biotin-labeled DNA probes specifically against lncSNHG5 were incubated with CAF lysates for 2 h. Streptavidin-coupled agarose beads were added to separate the RNA-protein or RNA-RNA compound, and western blotting or qRT-PCR was then performed. The primer sequences used in the pull-down assay can be found in Table S4.RIP assays were conducted using an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation kit (Millipore, USA) based on the manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, 3\u00d7107 CAFs were lysed in lysis buffer at 4 \u00b0C, and the magnetic beads were incubated with 5 \u00b5g of IGF2BP2 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the cell lysate was incubated with the antibody-bead complex in immunoprecipitation buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The IGF2BP2-RNA immunoprecipitates binding with magnetic beads were eluted using elution buffer for 0.5 h at 55 \u00b0C. RNA was purified and then used for qRT-PCR.Luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assaysFor the luciferase reporter assay, the ZNF281 promoters, CCL2 and CCL5 promoters with ZNF281 binding motifs (WT) or their mutant promoters were inserted into the pGL3 vector (Promega). The pGL3-ZNF281-promoter-WT, pGL3-CCL2-promoter (WT or Mut) and pGL3-CCL5-promoter (WT or Mut) were transfected into CAFs with the pCMV-Renilla control. The luciferase activity was measured approximately 36 h after transfection.ChIP assays were performed using the Chromatin IP Kit (CST, #9005, USA). Briefly, CAFs were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and glycine to cross-link histones and nonhistone proteins to chromatin. The anti-ZNF281 antibody or corresponding IgG was used to pull down the chromatin associated with ZNF281. Subsequently, the specific DNA fragments were quantified by qRT-PCR. The primer sequences used for the ChIP assay are listed in Table S5.Gene-specific m6A qPCR assaysGene-specific m6A qPCR assays were performed using the Magna MeRIP m6A Kit (Millipore, Billerica). In short, 100 \u00b5g of total RNA was sheared by metal ion-induced fragmentation to approximately 200 nt in length, and the sheared RNAs were purified and incubated with the beads combined with m6A or IgG antibody in IP buffer (500 \u00b5L, 1\u00d7) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, the methylated ZNF281 mRNA was eluted from the bead-bound immunoprecipitation complex. The MeRIP RNA was further quantified by qRT-PCR, and one-tenth of fragmented RNA was kept as an input control. The relative levels of m6A in each group were normalized to the tenfold input.Tissue fluorescence stainingTissue sections were first blocked with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution to block endogenous peroxidase, then blocked with BSA, incubated overnight with primary antibody CD31, incubated with HRP secondary antibody at room temperature for 50 min, and reacted with TYR-520 fluorescent dye in the dark for 10-15 min. These sections were reincubated with the primary antibodies ZO-1 and Occludin, and the above steps were repeated, switching to TYR-570 and TYR-690 fluorescent dyes. Fluorescence scanning was performed after DAPI staining.Xenograft Mouse ModelOrthotopic tumor xenografts were established as described previously. MDA-MB-231 cells (1\u00d7106 cells/mouse) were mixed with an equivalent number of NFs/Ctrl, CAFs/shNC, CAFs/sh lncSNHG5, CAFs/shZNF281, CAFs/sh lncSNHG5/ZNF281, CAFs/RS102895, CAFs/Maraviroc or CAFs/Cenicriviroc in 200 \u00b5l PBS:Matrigel at a ratio of 1:1. The cell mixture was subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old female nude mice (n=10 for each group). Mice were fed RS102895, maraviroc or cenicriviroc every 3 days by gavage. For the in vivo permeability assay, 100 \u03bcg/g rhodamine B isothiocyanate-dextran was intravenously administered to nude mice for 3 h, followed by cardiac perfusion to remove excess dye. After 2 weeks, the mice (6 weeks old) were sacrificed for tissue collection and assessment. The lungs of the mice were used for frozen sections and fluorescent staining with CD31, ZO-1 and Occludin antibodies, and the blood of the mice was used to measure the serum levels of CCL2 and CCL5. Six weeks later, the nude mice (10 weeks old) were sacrificed. The mouse lungs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to detect lung metastases. All animal experiments were approved by the animal care ethics committees of Chongqing Medical University.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. Differences between groups were compared using paired/unpaired t test, a chi-square test, or one-way ANOVA. Kaplan\u2012Meier analysis was conducted to assess the rate of overall survival and relapse-free survival. The data are presented as the means \u00b1 SDs from the data of experiments that were independently repeated at least three times. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsLncSNHG5 is highly expressed in breast CAFs and closely related to tumor metastasisTo identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs in CAFs, we performed a lncRNA microarray using primary NFs and CAFs isolated from BC tissues. The top 50 dysregulated lncRNAs are shown in a heatmap (Figure 1A). To confirm the aberrantly enhanced lncRNAs identified by microarray, ten of the upregulated lncRNAs were randomly selected and verified using qRT-PCR in paired CAFs and NFs (Figure S1A), among which lncSNHG5 was the most significantly upregulated. We confirmed that lncSNHG5 was a cytoplasmic RNA in breast CAFs using RNA-FISH (Figure 1B) and nucleocytoplasmic fractionation assays (Figure 1C). To understand the potential relationship between the expression levels of lncSNHG5 and the clinical characteristics of breast tumors, we performed qRT-PCR in 3 pairs of immortalized and 30 pairs of primary NFs and CAFs isolated from breast tumors, the results of which showed that the expression of lncSNHG5 was stably increased in CAFs (Figure 1D-E). Moreover, the lncSNHG5 expression levels of CAFs were significantly higher than those of breast cancer cells (SK-BR-3, MCF-7, Hs578T, BT549 and MDA-MB-231) and normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A; Figure 1F). Next, we evaluated the levels of lncSNHG5 in human breast tumor tissues with or without metastasis and their adjacent normal tissues and found that lncSNHG5 expression was higher in breast tumor tissues than in normal tissues, and that it was highly expressed in breast tumors with metastasis compared to those without metastasis (Figure 1G). After analysis of the GEO dataset GSE5460 (n=64), enhanced lncSNHG5 was positively correlated with tumor recurrence (Figure 1H). In addition, data analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) further confirmed that the increased lncSNHG5 was positively related to T stage, distant metastasis and a poor prognosis (Figure 1I-K). Finally, we assessed the relationship between lncSNHG5 levels and clinical pathological characteristics in 92 BC patients. Increased lncSNHG5 was closely related to lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and TNM stage (Table S6). In summary, lncSNHG5 is highly expressed in CAFs and closely related to BC malignancy.To investigate the biological function of lncSNHG5 in CAFs, we overexpressed ectopic lncSNHG5 in NFs (Figure S1B) and compared the differentially expressed genes between NFs-NC and NFs-lncSNHG5 using RNA-seq. We identified more than one thousand dysregulated genes by setting a threshold value of \u201cP < 0.05 and fold change \u22651.5\u201d. As visualized by the volcano plot, 621 upregulated and 528 downregulated genes were found to be differentially expressed between NFs/NC and NFs/lncSNHG5 (Figure S1C). The top 50 dysregulated genes are shown in the heatmap (Figure S1D). Interestingly, after analysis by bioinformatics, lncSNHG5 was found to be potentially involved in the regulation of angiogenesis (Figure S1E) and cell migration (Figure S1F), and KEGG enrichment results also indicated that lncSNHG5 was mainly related to cytokine-related biological processes (Figure S1G), suggesting that lncSNHG5 in stromal fibroblasts potentially affects tumor metastasis by regulating angiogenesis and cytokine-related biological processes in breast tumors.LncSNHG5 in breast CAFs primes a premetastatic niche by inducing angiogenesis and vascular leakinessOur and other previous studies have shown that CAFs in primary tumors play a crucial role in lung metastasis of breast cancer, and premetastatic niche (PMN) formation is considered to be an important step for tumor metastasis in distant organs. We next asked whether CAFs in primary tumors contribute to PMN formation. Active angiogenesis and increased vascular permeability are initial steps and key features of premetastatic niche formation; therefore, we explored whether lncSNHG5 regulates angiogenesis and vascular permeability to prime the premetastatic niche. When lncSNHG5 was knocked down in CAFs using two independent lentiviruses (Figure S2A), the conditioned medium (CM) derived from lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs dramatically decreased the tube formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure 2A). In contrast, CM from lncSNHG5-overexpressing NFs clearly increased the tube formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure S2B-C), supporting the idea that lncSNHG5 potentially regulates angiogenesis. To understand whether lncSNHG5 can regulate endothelial permeability, trans-endothelial invasion assays and in vitro permeability assays were then carried out. Compared with the control, CM from lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs markedly dampened endothelial permeability (Figure 2B-C), while CM from lncSNHG5-overexpressing NFs clearly promoted endothelial permeability (Figure S2D-E). Coculture of HUVECs with the supernatant from lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs or lncSNHG5-overexpressing NFs showed that lncSNHG5 knockdown in CAFs markedly increased expression of tight junction biomarkers ZO-1 and Occludin in HUVECs (Figure 2D-E), whereas overexpression of lncSNHG5 in NFs clearly reduced ZO-1 and Occludin levels in HUVECs (Figure S2F-G).To evaluate whether lncSNHG5 in CAFs plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability in the premetastatic niche, a mixture of MDA-MB-231 and NFs or CAF/shNC or CAF/shSNHG5 was orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of nude mice to establish a premetastatic mouse model for 2 weeks. Rhodamine-dextran was intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice to assess lncSNHG5-mediated vascular permeability in vivo, and fluorescent staining was performed to determine the levels of vascular markers CD31 and tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin in lung tissue to reflect the angiogenesis and permeability changes of lung blood vessels. We observed that the permeability (Figure 2F-G) and microvessel density (MVD; Figure 2H) of pulmonary capillaries were significantly increased, and the ZO-1 and Occludin levels (Figure 2I-J) were clearly decreased in the tumor-bearing mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs (MDA-MB-231/CAFs shNC) before lung metastasis, while the lung capillary permeability and MVD were markedly decreased, and the expression levels of ZO-1 and Occludin were increased in the tumor-bearing mice injected with the mixture of MDA-MB-231 cells and NFs (MDA-MB-231/NFs Ctrl) or lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs (MDA-MB-231/CAFs shlncSNHG5; Figure 2F-J). These data demonstrate that lncSNHG5 in breast CAFs can induce angiogenesis and vascular leakiness to promote premetastatic niche formation.LncSNHG5 promotes angiogenesis and endothelial permeability by regulating ZNF281 in CAFsTranscription factors play a pivotal role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. To search for the potential target genes of lncSNHG5, we analyzed the upregulated genes with a cutoff value of \u201cP < 0.05 and fold change \u22651.5\u201d in the gene expression profile (NFs/lncSNHG5 vs. NFs/NC, and CAFs vs. NFs) and found that the transcription factors ZNF281, SP100 and GLI1 were potentially regulated by lncSNHG5 (Figure 3A). The mRNA and protein levels of ZNF281 were significantly elevated in lncSNHG5-overexpressing NFs (Figure S3A) but remarkably reduced in lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs (Figure 3B). The increased ZNF281 in CAFs was verified by qRT-PCR in 30 pairs of primary breast NFs and CAFs (Figure 3C) and 3 pairs of immortalized NFs and CAFs (Figure S3B). Using Pearson correlation analysis, we further validated that ZNF281 levels were positively correlated with lncSNHG5 expression (Figure 3D), suggesting that ZNF281 is the target of lncSNHG5. Furthermore, ZNF281 was highly expressed in BC and was more highly expressed in metastatic breast tumors than in those without metastasis (Figure 3E). To understand whether ZNF281 is related to angiogenesis, we performed GSEA. The results showed that ZNF281 is positively related to endothelial cell migration and vasculature development (Figure S3C).To test the role of ZNF281 in endothelial cells, we successfully established lentivirus-mediated ZNF281 knockdown CAFs and ectopic ZNF281-overexpressing NFs (Figure S3D-E). Compared with the control, CM from ZNF281-overexpressing NFs clearly facilitated tube formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure S3F-G) and endothelial permeability (Figure S3H-I) and suppressed the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin (Figure S3J). Conversely, knockdown of ZNF281 in CAFs dramatically dampened tube formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure 3F) and endothelial permeability (Figure 3G-H) and increased the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin in HUVECs (Figure 3I). Moreover, restoration of ZNF281 expression in lncSNHG5 knockdown CAFs partially rescued these aforementioned phenotypes and the levels of ZO-1 and Occludin in HUVECs (Figure 3F-I). Thus, these data demonstrate that lncSNHG5 can promote angiogenesis and endothelial permeability by regulating ZNF281 in CAFs.lncSNHG5 enhances ZNF281 mRNA stability by binding with the m6A reader IGF2BP2We then asked how lncSNHG5 increases ZNF281 expression. First, we tested the impact of lncSNHG5 on the transcriptional regulation of ZNF281 expression. A luciferase reporter assay showed that lncSNHG5 knockdown in CAFs or ectopic lncSNHG5 in NFs had no impact on the promoter activity of ZNF281 (Figure S4A-B). Based on the cytoplasmic distribution of lncSNHG5 (Figure 1B-C), we hypothesized that lncSNHG5 might serve as a scaffold to regulate ZNF281 mRNA stability at the posttranscriptional level, as most cytoplasmic lncRNAs do. Indeed, when lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs or ectopic lncSNHG5-overexpressing NFs were treated with actinomycin D, the half-life of ZNF281 mRNA dramatically decreased in lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs in a time-dose-dependent pattern, whereas it increased in lncSNHG5-overexpressing NFs (Figure 4A-B), suggesting that lncSNHG5 plays a role in ZNF281 mRNA stability at the posttranscriptional level. To identify the potential lncSNHG5-binding proteins, we performed RNA pulldown followed by silver staining and mass spectrometry analysis. IGF2BP2 was significantly enriched in the precipitates with synthesized sense lncSNHG5 compared to antisense lncSNHG5 (Figure 4C). RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were subsequently performed using an antibody against IGF2BP2, and qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the RNA levels of lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 in the IGF2BP2 immunoprecipitates. As expected, lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 mRNA were notably enriched in the IGF2BP2 immunoprecipitates (Figure 4D). To further investigate whether IGF2BP2 could bridge lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 mRNA, we conducted a pull-down assay with a biotinylated antisense DNA probe against lncSNHG5 followed by western blotting to detect IGF2BP2, and qRT-PCR to test ZNF281 mRNA in the precipitates. The data confirmed that ZNF281 mRNA and IGF2BP2 were in the precipitates (Figure 4E), suggesting that IGF2BP2 acts as a mediator for the interaction between lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 mRNA. Next, we asked which fragment of lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 is necessary for interacting with IGF2BP2, and performed deletion-mapping and RNA pull-down assays. We found that the lncSNHG5 fragment Del1 (1-170 nt) and ZNF281 fragment 3'-UTR could bind with IGF2BP2 (Figure 4F-G), which has four K homology (KH) domains and two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs; Figure S4C). Furthermore, we observed that the KH1/2 domain (T2) of IGF2BP2 was essential for lncSNHG5 binding and that the KH3/4 domain (T3) was associated with ZNF281 (Figure 4H), suggesting a ternary complex among lncSNHG5, IGF2BP2 and ZNF281 3\u2032-UTR.Next, we asked whether the lncSNHG5-mediated recruitment of IGF2BP2 is necessary for ZNF281 mRNA stability. IGF2BP2 can function as an m6A reader for m6A-modified mRNAs and increase mRNA stability. Knockdown of lncSNHG5 had less impact on the protein level of IGF2BP2 in CAFs (Figure S4D). Loss of lncSNHG5 or IGF2BP2 in CAFs (Figure S4E) notably decreased lncSNHG5, IGF2BP2 and ZNF281 mRNA levels in the pull-down precipitates, and restoration of IGF2BP2 in IGF2BP2-knockdown CAFs recovered the levels of lncSNHG5, IGF2BP2 and ZNF281 mRNA in the precipitates (Figure S4F-H), suggesting that lncSNHG5-recruited IGF2BP2 is necessary for the formation of the ternary complex among lncSNHG5, IGF2BP2 and ZNF281. In addition, by conducting gene-specific m6A assays, we detected less m6A-modified ZNF281 mRNA in the precipitates of lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs or IGF2BP2-knockdown CAFs, which were restored by ectopic IGF2BP2 (Figure 4I). Accordingly, we observed that ZNF281 mRNA stability (Figure 4J) and mRNA and protein levels of ZNF281 (Figure S4I-J) were significantly decreased in lncSNHG5- or IGF2BP2-knockdown CAFs, and the decreased half-life of mRNA stability and mRNA and protein levels of ZNF281 caused by loss of lncSNHG5 or IGF2BP2 could be partially rescued by ectopic IGF2BP2 in CAFs (Figure 4J, Figure S4I-J). Taken together, these data demonstrate that lncSNHG5-mediated IGF2BP2 recruitment facilitates m6A methylation in the 3\u2032-UTR of ZNF281 to promote ZNF281 mRNA stability and ZNF281 protein levels.ZNF281 transcriptionally regulates CCL2 and CCL5 expression in CAFsNext, we asked how lncSNHG5-mediated ZNF281 is involved in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Using GSEA in the TCGA dataset, we found that lncSNHG5 can positively regulate cytokine-related biological processes (Figure 5A), which is consistent with the data mentioned above (Figure S1G). To identify the target cytokines of ZNF281 in breast CAFs, we compared the top 30 increased and decreased cytokines potentially regulated by ZNF281 (Figure S5A) with the upregulated cytokines acquired by microarray screen in both NFs/lncSNHG5 and primary CAFs, and found that CCL2, CCL5 and SPP1 were candidate targets of ZNF281 (Figure 5B). Furthermore, we confirmed that ectopic ZNF281 in NFs markedly upregulated stromal CCL2 and CCL5 expression and enhanced their secretion in the supernatant but had no effect on VEGFA (a known pro-angiogenic factor) levels (Figure S5B-F). Similarly, knockdown of ZNF281 or lncSNHG5 in CAFs significantly decreased CCL2 and CCL5 expression and reduced their secretion, and the loss of lncSNHG5 leading to decreased CCL2 and CCL5 was restored by ectopic ZNF281 in CAFs (Figure 5C-G). However, the VEGFA levels were not impacted by ZNF281 or lncSNHG5 in CAFs. After evaluating CCL2 and CCL5 expression in 30 pairs of CAFs and NFs by qRT\u2012PCR and their secreted proteins in the supernatant by ELISA, CCL2 and CCL5 were clearly higher in primary CAFs than in NFs (Figure S5G-H). In addition, the potential ZNF281-binding sites on the CCL2 and CCL5 promoters were analyzed by bioinformatics prediction (http://jaspar.genereg.net), and a luciferase reporter assay verified that ZNF281 can promote the transcriptional activity of the wild-type CCL2 and CCL5 promoters but not the mutant CCL2 and CCL5 promoters (Figure 5H-I). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further verified that ZNF281 binds to the CCL2 promoter region (-1077 to -1067 nt) and CCL5 promoter region (-36 to -26 nt) (Figure 5J-K). Taken together, these data support the idea that ZNF281 can transcriptionally regulate CCL2 and CCL5 expression.Breast CAF-derived CCL2 and CCL5 activate P38 MAPK signaling in endothelial cellsTo investigate the functional role of CCL2 and CCL5 on endothelial cells, the potential downstream signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, p38 MAPK) activated by CCL2 and CCL5 were assessed in HUVECs. Knockdown of lncSNHG5 or ZNF281 in CAFs did not affect the activation of STAT3, AKT or VEGFR2 in HUVECs. However, loss of lncSNHG5 or ZNF281 in CAFs clearly led to a reduction in phosphorylated P38 (p-P38) in HUVECs, which was rescued by ectopic ZNF281 in lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs (Figure S6A), indicating that the lncSNHG5-ZNF281-CCL2/5 signaling axis activates P38 MAPK signaling in HUVECs. Knockdown of CCL2 and CCL5 in CAFs (Figure S6B) resulted in reduced secretion of CCL2 and CCL5 by CAFs (Figure S6D-E, right panels) and decreased p-P38 and increased ZO-1 and Occludin in HUVECs (Figure 6A-B and Figure S6F, right panels), as well as overexpression of ectopic CCL2 and CCL5 in NFs (Figure S6C), which led to increased CCL2 and CCL5 in the supernatant (Figure S6D-E, left panels), dramatically increased p-P38 levels and reduced ZO-1 and Occludin levels in HUVECs but had no effect on VEGFR activity (Figure 6A-B and Figure S6F, left panels). Furthermore, treating HUVECs with recombinant human CCL2 (rCCL2) and/or CCL5 (rCCL5) notably increased p-P38 levels and decreased ZO-1 and Occludin expression (Figure 6C-D left panels, and Figure S6G), whereas rCCL2- and rCCL5-induced changes were partially reversed by RS102895 (CCR2 inhibitor) and maraviroc (CCR5 inhibitor) and completely reversed by cenicriviroc (CCR2 and CCR5 inhibitor) but not by axitinib (VEGFR inhibitor) (Figure 6C-D right panels, and Figure S6G). Correspondingly, CM derived from CCL2- and CCL5-overexpressing stromal fibroblasts significantly facilitated tube formation and endothelial permeability of HUVECs, while CM from CCL2- and CCL5-knockdown CAFs impeded the tube formation and endothelial permeability of HUVECs (Figure 6E-F, and Figure S7A). Treatment of HUVECs with RS102895, maraviroc or cenicriviroc clearly inhibited rCCL2- and rCCL5-stimulated tube formation and vascular permeability, and cenicriviroc had the most dramatic effect (Figure 6G-H, and Figure S7B). Furthermore, inhibition of P38 MAPK signaling with SB203580 markedly abolished rCCL2- and rCCL5-induced tubule formation and vascular permeability and increased ZO-1 and Occludin levels in HUVECs (Figure S7C-E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the lncSNHG5-ZNF281-CCL2/5 signaling axis promotes angiogenesis and vascular permeability by activating P38 MAPK signaling in HUVECs.LncSNHG5/ZNF281 signaling-mediated CCL2 and CCL5 secretion contributes to premetastatic niche formation by promoting angiogenesis and vascular permeabilityTo further evaluate whether the lncSNHG5-ZNF281-CCL2/CCL5 signaling axis contributes to PMN formation, we established mouse models and evaluated PMN formation via angiogenesis and vascular permeability as described above. Indeed, we observed that the permeability and MVD of pulmonary capillaries were significantly increased in the tumor-bearing mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and CAFs (MDA-MB-231/CAFs shNC) before lung metastasis, and the expressions of ZO-1 and Occludin were decreased. By contrast, the lung capillary permeability and MVD were markedly decreased in the tumor-bearing mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and NFs (MDA-MB-231/NFs Ctrl) or CAFs with shRNA against lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 (CAFs/sh lncSNHG5, CAFs/shZNF281), or CAFs with inhibitors RS102895 or Maraviroc or Cenicriviroc (CAFs/RS102895, CAFs/Maraviroc, CAFs/Cenicriviroc), and the ZO-1 and Occludin levels were increased in these groups. lncSNHG5 knockdown induced a decrease of lung vascular permeability and angiogenesis, and the increase of ZO-1 and Occludin was rescued by overexpression of ectopic ZNF281 in CAFs (Figure 7A-C). Correspondingly, the serum CCL2 and CCL5 levels were highest in the mice injected with MDA-MB-231/CAFs shNC and MDA-MB-231/CAFs sh lncSNHG5/ZNF281, and decreased serum CCL2 and CCL5 levels were observed in tumor-bearing mice injected with MDA-MB-231/CAFs shRNAs against lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 (CAFs/sh lncSNHG5, CAFs/shZNF281; Figure 7D-E). Consistent with the changes in serum CCL2 and CCL5 in tumor-bearing mice, there were corresponding changes in ZO-1, Occludin and phosphorylated p38 protein levels in these premetastatic mouse lungs. In addition, after injection of RS102895 or maraviroc or cenicriviroc to block the binding of CCL2/CCR2 or/and CCL5/CCR5, the levels of phosphorylated p38 were decreased, and the levels of ZO-1 and Occludin were increased (Figure 7F). These data illustrate that the lncSNHG5-ZNF281 axis induction of enhanced CCL2 and CCL5 in CAFs facilitates angiogenesis and permeability of pulmonary capillaries to promote lung premetastatic niche formation in vivo.The lncSNHG5-ZNF281-CCL2/CCL5 signaling axis facilitates BC metastasisIt has been previously reported that the establishment of a premetastatic niche is critical for the colonization of tumor cells in distant metastatic organs. To determine whether lncSNHG5-ZNF281-CCL2/CCL5 signaling in CAFs promotes BC metastasis, we established a metastatic mouse model for 6 weeks. Compared with the tumor-bearing mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, the tumor-bearing mice injected with the mixture of MDA-MB-231 cells and NFs or CAFs with shRNA against lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 (CAF/sh lncSNHG5, CAF/shZNF281) or CAFs with inhibitors RS102895 or marviroc or cenicriviroc (CAFs/RS102895, CAFs/Maraviroc, CAFs/Cenicriviroc) had fewer and smaller lung metastases, whereas overexpression of ectopic ZNF281 in the lncSNHG5-knockdown CAFs (CAFs/sh lncSNHG5/ZNF281) rescued the lung metastases (Figure 8A-C). Accordingly, the serum levels of CCL2 and CCL5 were accompanied by lncSNHG5 and ZNF281 changes in these mouse models (Figure S8A-B). Taken together, these data illustrate that the lncSNHG5-ZNF281-CCL2/CCL5 signaling axis in CAFs plays an important role in breast cancer metastasis in vivo.To expand our findings of CCL2 and CCL5 regulated by lncSNHG5-ZNF281 signaling in promoting tumor metastasis, we evaluated CCL2 and CCL5 levels in tumor tissues and serum CCL2 and CCL5 of healthy donors and BC patients with or without metastasis. Our data showed that CCL2 and CCL5 were more highly expressed in BC tissues than in normal tissues and that these proteins were increased to a greater extent in tumors with distant metastasis than in those without metastasis (Figure 8D-E). Similarly, high levels of serum CCL2 and CCL5 were observed in BC patients in contrast to healthy donors, and metastatic BC patients had higher levels of serum CCL2 and CCL5 than those without metastasis (Figure 8F-G). Analysis of the TCGA and GSE25066 datasets showed that high levels of CCL2 or CCL5 were closely related to distant metastasis (Figure S8C-D) and poor relapse-free survival (Figure S8E-F). Interestingly, when both CCL2 and CCL5 were highly expressed, patients had the worst prognosis (Figure 8H). In addition, the high levels of CCL2 and CCL5 were a good diagnostic index of poor prognosis for BC patients as assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Figure 8I). Taken together, our work demonstrates that activated stromal lncSNHG5-ZNF281-CCL2/CCL5 signaling plays a vital prometastatic role in BC.DiscussionAngiogenesis and vascular permeability are crucial for PMN formation. The activated CAFs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that promote tumor progression are well known. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying breast CAFs in PMN formation remain less understood. In the current study, we show that lncSNHG5 is enhanced in breast CAFs and is closely related to poor survival of BC patients. The increased lncSNHG5 in breast CAFs plays a key role in PMN formation by regulating angiogenesis and vascular permeability by recruiting IGF2BP2 to increase ZNF281 mRNA stability in an m6A-dependent pattern. Furthermore, ZNF281 in CAFs upregulated CCL2 and CCL5 rather than VEGFA expression, which stimulated angiogenesis and vascular permeability through P38 MAPK signaling in endothelial cells, consequently contributing to lung PMN formation in tumor metastasis.The functions of lncRNAs depend on their subcellular localization. It is well established that nuclear lncRNAs are involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin modification and RNA processing, while cytoplasmic lncRNAs are involved in maintaining the stability and translation of mRNA and affect cell signaling cascades. However, many lncRNAs remain unknown. lncSNHG5 was previously reported to play a role in tumors mainly through competitive binding of miRNA. For example, lncSNHG5 works as a ceRNA by binding with miR-26a-5p, miR-132-3p or miR-154-5p to increase PCNA, GSK3\u03b2 and CREB5 expression to drive cell proliferation, migration and metastasis of tumor cells. Here, we show that stromal lncSNHG5 is largely localized in the cytoplasm of CAFs and interacts with IGF2BP2, which functions as a reader of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) to recognize m6A sites through the KH domain. Several studies have shown that IGF2BP2, as an RNA-binding protein, carries out a binding role with specific mRNAs to increase their stability. For instance, IGF2BP2 enhances DANCR stability, functioning as an m6A reader for m6A-modified DANCR mRNA in the maintenance of pancreatic cancer stemness. Moreover, LINC00460 was found to interact with IGF2BP2 in promoting the proliferation and metastasis of colorectal cancer by increasing the stability of HMGA1 mRNA via an m6A-mediated modification. Here, we show that lncSNHG5-mediated recruitment of IGF2BP2 binds to the mRNA 3'-UTR of ZNF281, a transcription factor, and increases ZNF281 levels through m6A modification to regulate CCL2 and CCL5 transcription and secretion, leading to PMN formation. Nevertheless, the m6A modification status may also depend on the function of m6A methyltransferase or m6A demethylases; whether there are aberrantly expressed methylases or demethylases in CAFs that play a pivotal role in the m6A modification of ZNF281 needs further exploration.Premetastatic niche formation is the precursor or determinant of tumor colonization and the emergence of metastases in distant organs. Previous studies have found that primary tumors can promote PMN formation by secreting factors and tumor-shed extracellular vesicles. It has been reported that primary tumor-released LOXL2 can promote the expression of FN, MMP9 and CXCL12 and the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) to facilitate the generation of lung PMN in hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, BC cell-derived exosomal miR-21 contributes to PMN formation by inducing osteoclast differentiation to promote bone metastasis. However, the role of primary TME stromal cells in the formation of the PMN in distant organs is less well studied. Only a few studies have shown that primary TME stromal cells may participate in PMN construction. For example, CYP4A in tumor-associated macrophages is involved in PMN formation and metastasis by regulating the expression of TGF-\u03b2, SDF-1 and VEGF. A recent study showed that CAF-derived EVs boost lung PMN formation in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma. Here, we confirmed that primary CAFs are involved in PMN formation via angiogenesis and vascular permeability in breast cancer.In the current study, we demonstrate that the lncSNHG5-ZNF281 signaling axis in breast CAFs plays a central role in lung PMN formation in breast cancer by regulating CCL2 and CCL5 expression. Notably, angiogenesis and vascular permeability are the key steps in PMN formation. Cancer-secreted miR-105 can destroy vascular endothelial barriers to accelerate BC metastasis by decreasing ZO-1 levels during the early premetastatic stage. Calcineurin-NFAT-angiopoietin-2 signaling was found to activate endothelial cells to trigger angiogenesis in early metastatic lesions. Moreover, VEGFA is considered a crucial factor in regulating angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Intriguingly, our study revealed that the lncSNHG5-ZNF281 signaling axis plays a key role in VEGF-independent angiogenesis and vascular leakage by regulating CCL2 and CCL5 expression in CAFs. This may be a reason for the limited effectiveness of antiangiogenic therapy for some solid tumors, including breast cancer. CCL2-CCR2 signaling has been shown to trigger vascular permeability and metastasis via p38 MAPK and JAK2-STAT5 signaling. This is in line with our findings that CAF-derived CCL2 and CCL5 bind to CCR2 and CCR5 receptors, specifically activating p38 MAPK signaling in endothelial cells, thus critically impacting PMN formation. In this study, we verified that lncSNHG5-ZNF281-mediated CCL2/CCL5 release into serum notably decreases ZO-1 and Occludin levels in endothelial cells, increases MVD and leads to activation of p-P38 in lung tissues, which promotes angiogenesis and permeability of pulmonary capillaries to facilitate PMN generation in lung tissues before the occurrence of lung metastasis. Excitingly, blocking CCL2/CCR2 and CCL5/CCR5 signaling in vivo with the inhibitors RS102895, maraviroc and cenicriviroc significantly inhibited angiogenesis and vascular permeability in the lung PMN, especially cenicriviroc, which inhibited both CCR2 and CCR5 and was observed to have a powerful inhibitory effect on BC metastasis in this study, indicating a new strategy for the clinical prevention and treatment of BC metastasis.ConclusionsTaken together, our work highlights the role of stromal lncSNHG5 in CAFs in PMN formation via ZNF281-CCL2/5-p-P38 signaling in the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular permeability, thus triggering tumor metastasis in BC. The enhanced lncSNHG5 and CCL2/CCL5 may serve as potential novel diagnostic markers, and RS102895, maraviroc or cenicriviroc, and inhibitors of CCR2 and/or CCR5, may be potential molecules to prevent lung metastasis in BC patients.Supplementary MaterialAbbreviationsLncRNALong noncoding RNABCBreast cancerCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsPMNPremetastatic nicheNFsNormal fibroblastsHUVECsHuman

IntroductionBreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Clinically, breast cancers are categorized into four subtypes based on their intrinsic characteristics of cancer cells to facilitate targeted therapy. Immunohistochemical determinations of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki67 status are used to categorize these tumors. In accordance with the more recent criteria, breast cancers are classified as: (1) luminal A (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative); (2) luminal B (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or Ki67 > 20%); (3) HER2-enriched (HER2 amplified, ER- and PR-negative); and (4) triple-negative (ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative) subtypes.Prognosis and survival are different depending on these subtypes. Luminal tumors, the most frequent (accounting for 50\u201360% of breast cancers), are associated with the most favorable prognoses, while HER2-overexpressing and triple-negative tumors are associated with worst prognoses. However, a biological heterogeneity exists in luminal tumors, and numerous patients with these tumors died of relapsed disease. For this reason, novel markers to improve prognosis and to decide therapeutic strategies are required.Tumors are complex tissues composed of a heterogeneous mixture of cells, including cancer-cells and stromal cells. It is known that characteristics of stromal cells may dictate tumor outcome in breast cancer. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute the principal component of the tumor stroma. CAFs display a high proliferation rate and show capacity to facilitate tumor progression by degrading and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), activating the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting an angiogenic shift, inducing a metabolic reprogramming toward a reverse Warburg phenotype, or stem cell trait achievement, compared with normal fibroblasts. CAFs promote these actions by the secretion of growth factors and cytokines that influence the epithelium behavior. In this context, CAFs can activate the NF\u03baB signaling pathway to evoke a pro-inflammatory response, and through the secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and SDF-1, induce the recruitment of immune cells.In the present study, we have investigated the gene expression of 19 factors implicated in tumor progression in CAFs from luminal breast carcinomas, and their variation after co-culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Those factors were: the calcium-binding protein S100A4, several growth factors (FGF2, FGF7, HGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA, and IGF2), and we also studied inflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL8), chemokines (CCL2, CXCL12), important proteases (uPA, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP11), the nuclear factor NF\u03baB, and the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP1.2. Material and Methods2.1. Patient Selection and Their Characteristics, and Tissue Specimen Handling This study is a non-randomized prospective research which includes 19 women with a histological confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma of luminal type. We selected consecutive cases of T1 or T2 invasive ductal carcinoma of luminal type with sufficient tissue for cell culture, during the period between July 2011 and August 2013, who underwent for a tumor resection as their first therapeutic approach. The exclusion criteria were: prior history of malignant tumor, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, uterine cervix cancer in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ of breast cancer, and a history of having received any type of therapy prior to surgery. Table 1 shows characteristics of the 19 patients with invasive breast carcinoma, all included in the analyses performed in this study and classified as luminal A (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative) or luminal B (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or Ki67 > 20%).During the follow-up period, a total of 6 patients developed distant metastases. The follow-up period was 43 months for patients with recurrence and 58 months for patients without. Women were treated according to the guidelines used in our Institution (Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital de Jove). Before the evaluation of tumor samples, all patients gave their written informed consent. The study adhered to National regulations and was approved by the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital de Jove Ethics and Investigation Committee.2.2. Cell LinesThe estrogen-independent human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and the estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, were both purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).The MCF-7 cell line was cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Lonza, Visp, Switzerland), and the MDA-MB-231 cell line was maintained in high glucose DMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Both media were supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA, North Darmouth, MA, USA) and the antibiotic mixture 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, Paisley, UK).2.3. Primary Cell Culture Tumor samples were cut into 1 mm3 pieces and enzymatically dissociated in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Roche, Hertfordshire, UK) at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h.After enzymatic digestion, the suspension obtained was centrifuged at 400\u00d7 g for 5 min. Cell pellet was resuspended and cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 5 \u03bcg/mL insulin (Gibco), 1 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 5 ng/mL EGF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell cultures exhibited, predominantly, fibroblast morphology after three or four passages. Fibroblast culture purity was analyzed by flow-cytometry (Figure 1) using the antibody CD90 clone AS02 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) incubated at 1:50 (4 \u00b5g/mL) for 45 min. After, two washes with PBS 1X, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (FITC, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, ref.: 0103) for 30 min. CD90 clone AS02 antibody specificity was confirmed by immunohistochemistry before being used on study samples. Also, we analyzed the expression of CD34 (555822, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), which is expressed by hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors as well as by a multitude of other non-hematopoietic cell types, including epithelial progenitors and vascular endothelial progenitors.2.4. Co-Culture ExperimentsTranswell 24-well plates were used to perform co-cultures of fibroblasts with breast cancer cell lines. Fibroblast cells were plated at 2 \u00d7 104 cells in the bottom of the wells, whereas breast cancer cell lines were seeded (2 \u00d7 104 cells) in the 0.24 \u03bcm pore size tissue culture inserts, which were introduced into the fibroblasts-containing wells later on. Cells were co-cultured for 72 h in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Then, RNA extraction was performed using the following protocol.2.5. Real Time-PCR \u201cRNeasy Mini Kit\u201d (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) including the DNAse treatment was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for total RNA isolation. As described previously, the integrity and concentration of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by using a NanoDrop Technologies device, (Wilmington, DE, USA). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the \u201cTranscriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit\u201d (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The reverse transcription step was carried out using the following program: firstly, an incubation at 65 \u00b0C during 10 min was performed to ensure denaturation of RNA secondary structures, and then, the reverse transcription reaction was performed as follows: 10 min at 25 \u00b0C, 60 min at 50 \u00b0C, and 5 min at 85 \u00b0C.Expressions of different factors were measured using RealTime ready custom panel plates (Roche). These custom-designed plates contained the specific primers and probes for the factors studied and for three reference genes (Table 2). The mRNA levels were measured in a LightCycler 480 II (Roche) with the following cycling conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 s.The expression was quantified using advanced relative quantification. In this method, the crossing point (Cp) is automatically calculated using the LightCycler software as the first maximum of the second derivative of the curve. A combination of two housekeeping genes (\u03b2-actin and SDHA (Succinate dehydrogenase subunit A)) as a normalization factor was used to minimize sample variability and to increase the accuracy and resolution of gene expression normalization.2.6. ImmunohistochemistryTo study the protein expression of IGF2, immunohistochemistry staining was performed on tissue sections of breast cancer using a TechMate TM50 autostainer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), a primary antibody against IGF2 (ab9574, Abcam, antigen retrieval pH6, incubation 1 h) and the EnVision Detection kit (Dako). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol and permanently coverslipped, as previously described.2.7. Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test was used to determine whether sample data were normally distributed. As data were normally distributed, comparison between groups was performed with the Student\u2019s t test. Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Differences were considered significant when the p-value \u2264 0.05. The PASW Statistics program was used for all calculations.3. Results3.1. Molecular Profile of CAFsWe determined whether CAFs from luminal tumors presented phenotypic variability at their basal expression of several genes implicated in tumor progression (S100A4, FGF2, FGF7, HGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA, IGF2, IL6, IL8, CCL2, CXCL12, uPA, MMP2, MMP9, MMP11, NF\u03baB, and TIMP1). CCL2 and MMP9 gene expressions were significantly higher in CAFs from luminal B tumors compared to CAFs from luminal A tumors (p = 0.003 and p = 0.02, respectively, Figure 2). However, we found no significant differences in other pro-tumoral factors between CAFs from these two tumor subtypes.3.2. Molecular Profile of CAFs Co-Culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Cancer Cell LinesWe next examined the effect of breast tumor cell lines over different CAFs from luminal A or luminal B subtypes. We found different patterns in the expression of pro-tumoral factors depending on the CAF\u2019s luminal type co-cultured with the different cancer cell lines. CAFs from luminal A tumors co-cultured with the luminal cell line MCF-7, showed an increase in VEGFA levels (p = 0.028) (Figure 3A), but a decrease in the gene expression of HGF (p = 0.028), CCL2 (p = 0.028), NF\u03baB (p = 0.046), and MMP-9 (p = 0.028) (Figure 3A). CAFs from luminal B tumors co-cultured with MCF-7 showed a decrease in CCL2 (p = 0.003) and NF\u03baB (p = 0.009) gene expression, while they showed an increased gene expression of other important pro-tumoral factors such as TGF\u03b2 (p = 0.007), CXCL12 (p = 0.013), MMP-2 (p = 0.039) and VEGF A (p = 0.003) (Figure 3B). When CAFs were co-cultured with the triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell line, CAFs from luminal A tumors showed an increased gene expression of MMP-2 and VEGFA (p = 0.028, for both) (Figure 3C), whereas CAFs from luminal B tumors showed an increased expression in VEGFA (p = 0.003), S100A4 (p = 0.019), TGF\u03b2 (p = 0.004), IL6 (p = 0.049), and IL8 (p = 0.009), but a decrease of NF\u03baB expression (p = 0.028) (Figure 3D). All together, these data suggest that CAFs from luminal B tumors showed, globally, a higher gene expression profile of stromal pro-tumoral factors when co-cultured with any one of these two breast cancer cell lines.3.3. Relationship between CAFs\u2019 Molecular Profile and Development of Distant MetastasisWe also compared the relapse-free survival period with the basal molecular profiling of CAFs. Six patients developed distant metastasis during the follow-up period: two patients with luminal A tumors and four with luminal B tumors. Then, we re-analyzed the gene expression of CAFs comparing those patients developing metastasis with the rest of patients. Interestingly, we found that high IGF2 gene expression (>median) in CAFs was significantly associated with a shortened relapse-free survival (Figure 4A). In addition, higher basal IGF2 gene expression was found in CAFs from metastasic tumors than in CAFs from non-metastasic tumors in all luminal tumors (Figure 4B), and especially, in luminal B tumors (Figure 4C). No significant data was obtained for luminal A tumors due to the low recurrence rate in this population and the small sample size. Finally, we also observed that higher IGF2 gene expression in CAFs from metastatic tumors remained increased after co-culture with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4D,E).In order to confirm the protein expression of IGF2, we stained primary tumors tissue sections and observed the expression by fibroblast (Figure 5). However, we could not analyze all samples (no access to tissue block for all patients) and therefore we could not establish its concordance to metastasis development.4. DiscussionToday, breast tumors are categorized based on cancer cell characteristics for their management. Four main intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B, HER2\u2212enriched and basal-like) have been established over the last 15 years. Each of these subtypes has different features, clinical behaviors, and treatment response profiles. Luminal tumors, the most frequent type (accounting for 50\u201360% of breast cancers), are associated with the most favorable prognoses. However, a biological heterogeneity exists in luminal tumors, and numerous patients with these tumors died of relapsed disease. Our results indicate that CAFs from luminal B tumors show more pro-tumor characteristics compared with CAFs from luminal A tumors, which provide evidence of a possible contribution of the stroma to the different biological and clinical behavior between these tumors. Luminal A breast cancers are associated with a most favorable short-term prognosis due to its positive response to endocrine therapy. Luminal B tumors are recognized to have a more aggressive clinical behavior and unfavorable prognosis compared with luminal A tumors. In fact, many of the luminal B tumors are ER+/HER2\u2212/high Ki-67. However, expression profiles also classify the ER+/HER2+ tumors as luminal B, and these patients receive a different therapy regimen (that incorporates targeted anti-HER2 therapy) compared to other luminal B breast cancer. In addition, according to the 2013 St. Gallen Consensus, the diagnosis of a portion of patients with the luminal A subtype with poor prognosis was changed to the luminal B subtype, which was determined based on ER positivity, HER2 negativity, Ki67 expression > 14%, and PgR expression < 20%. Thus, luminal B breast tumors (that accounted for nearly 40% of all breast cancers) constitute the most heterogeneous molecular subtype at the clinical and molecular levels. Unfortunately, the immunohistochemistry of the luminal B subtype, based on intrinsic genetics characteristics from cancer cells, remains poorly defined, and it has now become a paramount importance to find new markers capable of segregating luminal tumors into clinically meaningful subgroups that may be used clinically to guide patient management. With this in mind, in the present study, we have tried to identify CAFs populations differing in their pro-tumor capabilities in these luminal tumors.In the present study, we found variability in the gene expression of factors implicated in tumor progression in CAFs from luminal breast carcinomas (Table 1), and after co-culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, depending whether those CAFs are from luminal A or B tumors. CAFs from luminal B tumors showed higher gene expression of MMP-9 and CCL2 compared to CAFs from luminal A tumors. These findings are relevant if we consider that MMP-9 (also known as Gelatinase B) is related to tumor invasion and metastasis by its capacity to degrade the type IV collagen found in basement membranes, and to induce angiogenesis. Likewise, MMP-9 has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and/or poor prognostic in patients with breast cancer. On the other hand, CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP1) is a chemokine that exerts a potent chemotactic, stimulatory, and mitogenic effects on mononuclear cells. High levels of CCL2 in the tumor microenvironment, as well as high circulating concentrations of this chemokine, have been associated with poor prognosis in breast carcinoma patients. CCL2 also stimulates the migration of mammary carcinoma cell lines, and mediates the recruitment of specific monocyte populations that support the establishment of metastatic disease.Especially relevant were our findings showing that different CAFs populations differentially expressed pro-tumor factors depending on co-cultured cancer cell lines. Thus, after co-culture with the luminal cell line MCF-7, CAFs from luminal A tumors showed an increase in VEGFA levels, but a decreased expression levels of other pro-tumor genes (HGF, CCL2, NF\u03baB, and MMP-9) while CAFs from luminal B tumors although showed decreased levels of CCL2 and NF\u03baB gene expression, but increased gene expression of other important pro-tumor factors like TGF\u03b2, CXCXL12, MMP-2, and VEGF A. Likewise, different patterns of gene expression were found in CAFs from Luminal A tumors, with increased expression of MMP-2 and VEGFA, or CAFs from luminal B tumors, with increased levels of VEGFA, S100A4, TGF\u03b2, IL6, and IL8, but decreased levels of NF\u03baB, after being co-cultured with the cell line MDA-MB-321.In general, CAFs from luminal B tumors showed higher expression of pro-tumor factors when co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines, which is in accordance with the fact that these tumors are associated with higher tumor aggressiveness. These overexpressed factors are of importance promoting several biological aspects of tumor progression. TGF\u03b2 is a well-known cytokine that induces malignant mammary epithelial cell to undergo EMT, leading to the acquisition of highly migratory, invasive and metastatic phenotypes. It has been also described that TGF\u03b2 can induce the expression of different proteins, such as growth factors, cytokines, and ECM proteins in CAFs, which promote tumor development in the adjacent epithelium. CXCL12 is a highly pleiotropic chemokine, influencing a variety of biological processes through the interaction with its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7. CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 signaling has been shown to play a role in tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis and bone marrow cell recruitment. In line with this, it has been demonstrated that co-implantation of tumor cells with fibroblasts expressing CXCL12 enhances tumor growth and CXCL12 overexpression has been linked to increased metastasis and poor prognosis. In addition, a number of different agents have been used to block the CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 interaction to inhibit metastasis.MMP-2 (Gelatinase A) together with MMP-9 (Gelatinase-B) are related to tumor invasion and metastasis by their special capacity to degrade type IV collagen in basement membrane, and to induce angiogenesis. MMP-2 production increased during the early phase of breast cancer, but also high levels of MMP-2 have been related to poor outcome in breast carcinomas. VEGFA is a potent regulator of angiogenesis and thereby involved in the development and progression of solid tumors, such as breast cancer. S100A4, a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein superfamily, has been described as a key player in promoting metastasis, acting as an angiogenic factor, inducing cell motility, and increasing the expression of MMPs. In fact, elevated levels of the calcium-binding protein S100A4 have been associated with poor patient survival in breast cancer patients and to induce metastasis in rodent models.Interestingly, we have observed high expression levels of IL6 and IL8 in CAFs from luminal B tumors after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells. Previous reports showed that both cytokines are important to maintain the aggressiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly tumorigenic cell line which appears to be devoid of stemness-related features. In addition, clinical studies have showed that both high levels of IL-6 or IL-8 have been associated with breast cancer recurrence. In addition, several strategies to disrupt IL-6 signaling or IL-8 signaling, in vitro or in vivo, significantly reduce tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer cells.Together, these gene expression data may to contribute to a better characterization of tumor stroma of luminal breast carcinomas.Finally, we reclassified the CAFs gene expression analysis considering patients developing or not distant metastasis during the follow-up period. An obvious limitation of the present study is the reduced number of patients who developed distant metastasis during the follow-up period. Nevertheless, and interestingly enough, we have observed that CAFs from metastatic luminal tumors had the highest IGF-2 gene expression, either in basal levels or after being co-cultured with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cell lines. These findings seem to be in agreement with previous data revealing that IGF2, which is overexpressed in a wide spectrum of human cancers, is associated with more aggressive tumors and with a poor prognosis. IGF-2 promotes excessive growth and anti-apoptotic effects in cancer cells. In fact, it has been shown that IGF-2 signaling is important to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. In addition, IGF-2 has been recently implicated in a positive feedback circuit as a critical mechanism to increase stemness and maintain breast cancer cells. More importantly, it has been suggested that CAFs derived from breast metastatic tumors have increased protumorogenic properties due to the increased expression of IGF2. On the other hand, there are several lines of evidence linking IGF signaling and luminal tumors. In one large follow-up study on breast cancer in postmenopausal women, serum levels of IGF-2, but not IGF-1, were positively associated with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer risk. Likewise, it has been reported that both the co-expression and interactions of IGF1R (receptor for IGF-1 and IGF-2) and ER signaling systems suggest a role for the IGF1R network in the resistance to endocrine therapy. It is also remarkable that IGF-2 is known to play an important role during fetal growth and development, and its expression in malignant tumors might implicate a more primitive cellular phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest that IGF-2 expression may be a potential useful marker of tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in luminal tumors.In summary, our data may contribute to a better biological characterization of the interaction between cancer cells and tumor stroma in luminal breast carcinomas. In this way, our results allow us to consider that, among the complex array of soluble factors produced by CAFs, it could arise possible new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for luminal breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization: N.E., M.F., L.O.G., and F.J.V.; Data curation: N.E., M.F., J.R.C., L.O.G., and F.J.V.; Formal analysis: N.O., S.C., M.F., and L.O.G.; Investigation: N.E., S.C., and M.F.; Methodology: N.E. and S.C.; Project administration: N.E. and F.J.V.; Resources: L.O.G. and F.J.V.; Writing\u2014original draft: N.E., S.C., M.F., and F.J.V; Writing\u2014review & editing: N.E., J.R.C., and F.J.V.

        "content": "Tumor initiation and progression are not only ascribed to the behavior of cancer cells, but also profoundly influenced by the tumor microenvironment. Inside, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have become key factors to accelerate growth and metastasis for the abundance in most solid tumors. Our group previously reported that Oroxylin A (OA), a flavone from Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi, possess the ability to suppress growth and invasion of several tumor cells. However, the regulatory effect of OA on stromal microenvironment is poorly understood. In this study, breast cancer-induced fibroblasts and primary breast CAFs from MMTV-PyMT mice were used to evaluate the influence of OA on the activation of fibroblasts. Results showed that OA could decrease the expression of \u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Thus, OA-deactivated CAFs did not further promote the proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. In vivo experiments, OA could also impede tumor metastasis through exhausting progressive CAFs. Mechanically, OA could specifically bind ACTN1 and significantly inhibit its expression to prevent CAF activation. As a consequence, OA could decrease the phosphorylation of FAK and STAT3, and reduce the secretion of CCL2 in CAFs. Altogether, OA could remodel stromal microenvironment and it is a potential therapeutic agent in breast cancer.",

Antibodies that block IFN receptors reduced CAF-dependent chemoprotection.ConclusionsCAF-induced activation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBCs results in chemoresistance. Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

        "content": "It is established that the interaction between microenvironment and cancer cells has a critical role in tumor development, given the dependence of neoplastic cells on stromal support.

Taken together, these data provide new insights into the role of miR-9 as an important player in the cross-talk between cancer cells and stroma.Tumorigenesis is not considered anymore a tumor cell-autonomous mechanism triggered by accumulation of somatic aberrations, but fostered by a two-way interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment.Cancer cells are indeed integrated in a biologically complex stroma, composed of different cell types (such as immune system components, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes) as well as extracellular matrix (ECM), which originates the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel.

IntroductionObesity is a global epidemic, and the World Health Organization estimates that obesity rates have nearly tripled since 1975. At the time of breast cancer diagnosis, obese women frequently have larger, higher grade tumors and an increased risk of metastasis, resulting in shorter disease-free and overall survival. Breast tumors from obese women also demonstrate increased desmoplasia, compared to tumors from lean women. Desmoplastic tumors, characterized by increased numbers of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and deposition of fibrillar collagens and extracellular matrix proteins within the stroma, are associated with diminished survival in breast cancer patients. The origins of increased tumor collagen and desmoplasia, particularly in obesity, are not completely understood.Obesity causes a state of chronic, macrophage-driven inflammation, as macrophages are recruited by necrotic adipocytes and form crown-like structures. This inflammation is in large part driven by the expression of chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), also referred to as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a chemokine which is first expressed by adipocytes in obese adipose tissue, and then by recruited macrophages. In obese mice with germline deletion of CCL2 or its receptor, CCR2, macrophage recruitment to adipose tissue is significantly reduced. Inflammation can also promote tumor growth, and increased CCL2 expression is correlated with more aggressive breast tumors as well as recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. Chronic inflammation has also been implicated in promoting adipose tissue fibrosis, which is characterized by deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins surrounding adipocytes. Within the mammary gland, elevated CCL2 expression driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter in epithelial cells resulted in enhanced collagen deposition surrounding mammary ducts. Within the breast tumor microenvironment, CCL2 expression by CAFs has been shown to enhance macrophage recruitment and promote cancer cell proliferation and cancer stem cells. The link between inflammation and stroma formation, including the development of CAFs, in breast tumors is poorly understood. Although CAFs frequently express marker smooth muscle actin (SMA), CAFs are a heterogeneous population of cells that can be separated into subsets based on the expression of other markers, including fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein-1, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2). It is currently not clear how obesity promotes the growth of tumors with enhanced desmoplasia and potentially alters tumor CAF populations.Understanding the impact of obesity on human breast tumors has been challenging to investigate due to the limited model systems to assess stromal changes during tumor progression. When transplanted into mouse mammary glands, human breast epithelial cells have limited ability to form epithelial structures. However when transplanted with cells isolated from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of reduction mammoplasty tissues, breast stromal cells support the growth of normal human breast epithelial cells to produce ductal and alveolar structures containing polarized luminal and basal epithelial cells. We have previously characterized a Human-In-Mouse (HIM) model to study how inflammation driven by CCL2 impacts breast tumor development and progression in vivo. In the HIM model, SVF cells isolated from a patient with a body mass index in the normal range support the growth and progression of premalignant lesions from oncogenic human breast epithelial cells. These SVF cells do not have an \u201cactivated\u201d phenotype as has been observed in adipose stromal cells from obese women, allowing for investigation of the effects of CCL2 expression within the developing tumor microenvironment. Transplantation of human breast epithelial cells transduced with lentivirus containing oncogenes results in the stepwise progression of human breast epithelium through distinct stages of premalignancy. These lesions as well as the resulting invasive carcinomas are histologically and molecularly similar to triple negative breast tumors, which lack expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Using this mouse model, formation of tumors by human breast epithelial cells can be examined in vivo, in an inflammatory microenvironment with similarities to obese breast adipose tissue.Here, we show that stromal CCL2 expression within developing mammary tumors enhanced end-stage tumor fibrosis. Myeloid-lineage CD11b + cells recruited early during tumor formation were critical for formation of CAFs and collagen deposition within tumors. With enhanced recruitment of macrophages, we also observed a significant increase in myeloid progenitor cells. Myeloid progenitor cells are a heterogenous cell population which give rise to multiple myeloid-lineage cell types, including bone marrow-derived fibrocytes, a cell population with characteristics of both macrophages and myofibroblasts. Fibrocytes have been identified in diseases characterized by both chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Fibrocytes may be a novel target within the tumor microenvironment to limit tumor fibrosis. Understanding how CCL2 expression recruits myeloid-lineage cells to promote tumor progression and desmoplasia may lead to identification of new therapeutics to enhance treatment options for obese breast cancer patients.2. Results2.1. CCL2 Expression Enhances Collagen Deposition in End-Stage TumorsGiven the relationship between inflammation and adipose tissue fibrosis, we utilized the HIM model to examine how elevated macrophage-driven inflammation within developing mammary tumors affects collagen deposition. Inguinal mammary fat pads of 3-week-old nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice were cleared of endogenous mammary epithelium and humanized with SVF cells expressing empty vector (SVF/EV) or CCL2 (SVF/CCL2) (Figure 1A). Human breast epithelial cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding KRasG12V and SV40ER and implanted with SVF/EV or SVF/CCL2 stromal cells into humanized mammary fat pads 2 weeks later. Mammary tumors were collected after 10 weeks when tumors that formed in SVF/CCL2 humanized mammary glands reached 1 cm in diameter (end-stage). Similar to our previous studies, tumors grew significantly larger in SVF/CCL2 humanized glands compared to tumors from SVF/EV glands (p = 0.03; Figure 1B).Although tumors grew faster in SVF/CCL2 humanized mammary glands, no significant differences were observed histologically among tumors in the SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 groups (Figure 1C). To examine epithelial cells within SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 tumors, tumor sections were stained with luminal epithelial cell marker cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and basal/myoepithelial cell marker cytokeratin 14 (CK14). Similar to human breast tumors, we observed distinct stromal and epithelial compartments (Figure 1C, Figure S1A). No significant differences were observed in the percent of cells that expressed CK8 or CK14 within SVF/EV or SVF/CCL2 tumors (Figure S1A). Isolated tumor cells demonstrated variable CCL2 expression, however no significant difference was observed among tumor cells from SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 tumors (Figure S1B). SV40 expression was only observed within epithelial cells (Figure S1C). Epithelial cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the KRasG12V lentiviral construct were distinct from SMA + stromal cells within the tumors (Figure S1D). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we have previously shown that mouse-derived stromal cells are recruited to form CAFs within tumors, while human-derived stromal cells are limited. Together, these data indicate that the epithelial component of the tumors is transformed human breast epithelial cells whereas the stromal compartment is mouse-derived stromal cells.To understand the composition of the mouse stroma within these tumors, we examined recruitment of F4/80 + macrophages and SMA + CAFs. Although we previously observed significant increases in macrophages early in tumor development in glands humanized with SVF/CCL2 stromal cells, no differences were observed within the SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 mammary tumors for F4/80 + macrophages at end-stage (p = 0.5, Figure 1D). Similarly, no differences were observed for SMA + CAFs within tumors at end-stage (p = 0.4, Figure 1E), suggesting that increased CCL2 expression within the microenvironment early in tumor development did not have lasting effects on either macrophage or CAF numbers in end-stage tumors. Given the association of inflammation with adipose tissue fibrosis, we examined collagen deposition within the end-stage tumors. We observed a significant increase in collagen measured using picrosirius red and Masson\u2019s trichrome staining in the SVF/CCL2 tumors of mice compared to SVF/EV tumors (p = 0.002, Figure 1F, Figure S1E), suggesting that early inflammation promotes a more fibrous mammary tumor microenvironment, similar to what is observed clinically in breast tumors of obese women.2.2. Temporal Changes in Macrophages and CAFs Are Observed in Developing SVF/CCL2 Mammary TumorsTo investigate how early changes in tumor development lead to increased collagen deposition in end-stage SVF/CCL2 tumors, we examined early time points following transplantation of oncogenic breast epithelial cells. When transplanted in the HIM model, breast epithelial cells isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissue form alveoli with lumens surrounded by an inner layer of epithelial cells that express estrogen receptor alpha and an outer layer of basal/myoepithelial cells. At 1.5 weeks following transplantation, we observed breast epithelial cells that filled the lumens surrounded by stromal cells in mammary glands humanized with either SVF/EV or SVF/CCL2 cells (Figure 2A). After 2.5 weeks, tumors were not yet palpable, however, disorganized epithelial cells could be observed surrounded by stromal cells (Figure 2A). Similar to our observations in end-stage tumors, we did not observe significant differences in the percentage of cells expressing CK8 or CK14 at either 1.5 or 2.5 weeks (Figure S2A,B). These results suggest that transplanted epithelial cells progressed through hyperplastic stages prior to invasive tumor growth.Within the transplanted mammary glands at 1.5 weeks, we observed a significant increase in F4/80 + macrophages in the stroma of SVF/CCL2 transplants compared to SVF/EV transplants (p = 0.002, Figure 2B). The macrophages were primarily recruited to the transplant site, as no crown-like structures were observed within the surrounding mammary adipose tissue (data not shown). Interestingly, at 2.5 weeks post-transplant, F4/80 + cells were similar in both groups (Figure 2B). To further examine changes in macrophages, we quantified CD11b + cells from transplanted mammary glands using flow cytometry (Figure S2C\u2013G). We observed a significant increase in CD11b + cells within SVF/CCL2 transplants at 1.5 weeks compared to SVF/EV transplanted mammary glands (p = 0.003, Figure 2C). This difference in CD11b + cells was no longer apparent at 2.5 weeks post-transplant (Figure 2C). In response to CCL2, myeloid-lineage cells are recruited from the bone marrow. To assess changes in CD11b + cells within the bone marrow, we quantified myeloid-lineage cells using flow cytometry (Figure S3A\u2013E). No significant differences were observed in CD11b + cells within the bone marrow of SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 mice at either 1.5 or 2.5 weeks post-transplant, although the percentage of CD11b + cells was decreased within the bone marrow from transplanted mice at 2.5 weeks compared to 1.5 weeks (Figure S3F,G), suggestive of increased CD11b + cell recruitment to the developing tumors. Together these data demonstrate that humanization of mouse mammary glands with CCL2 expressing stromal cells enhances macrophage recruitment early in tumor formation.While CAFs have been examined extensively in invasive ductal carcinoma, CAFs also play a role in progression of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive ductal carcinoma. Within developing tumors of our HIM mice, limited SMA expression was observed in the stroma of both SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 transplants at 1.5 weeks, and no significant differences were observed between the two groups (Figure 2D). However, at 2.5 weeks following transplantation, we observed a significant increase in SMA + CAFs within the SVF/CCL2 transplant sites compared to SVF/EV transplants (p = 0.008, Figure 2D). Together, these data suggest that early increases in macrophage-driven inflammation lead to enhanced CAF formation within developing tumors.2.3. Depletion of CD11b + Cells Early in Tumor Formation Reduces Tumor Growth and Collagen DepositionTo examine the relationship between the influx of macrophages and the other stromal changes observed during tumor progression, we depleted CD11b + cells using DTR-CD11b (Mac/SCID) mice. In these mice, expression of the simian diphtheria toxin receptor is regulated by the CD11b promoter, and upon treatment with diphtheria toxin (DT), monocytes and macrophages are selectively depleted. We transplanted human breast epithelial cells transduced with SV40ER and KRasG12V into inguinal mammary glands of Mac/SCID mice humanized with SVF/CCL2 stromal cells. At 1.5 weeks following transplantation, mice were treated with two doses of DT administered 24 h apart to reduce the number of CD11b + cells present at this early time point (Figure 3A). Transgenic mice treated with DT demonstrated significantly reduced CD11b + cells within the bone marrow and within transplant sites 24 h after the second injection of DT, compared to either non-transgenic mice treated with DT or vehicle-treated transgenic mice (Figure S4A\u2013D). We have previously shown that this reduction of CD11b + cells lasts for at least 7 days within the mammary gland.Treatment of Mac/SCID mice with DT resulted in significantly reduced tumor growth compared to tumors from vehicle-treated Mac/SCID mice or non-transgenic littermates treated with DT (p = 0.05; Figure 3B). At end-stage, tumors from DT-treated Mac/SCID mice had significantly reduced tumor weights compared to vehicle-treated Mac/SCID mice (p = 0.03; Figure 3C). Consistent with slower tumor growth, we observed significantly reduced Ki67 staining (Figure 3D) and mitotic figures (Figure 3E) in end-stage tumors of DT-treated Mac/SCID mice compared to either vehicle-treated Mac/SCID mice or DT-treated non-transgenic mice. When Ki67 staining was examined further, the majority of Ki67 positive cells were observed in the GFP + human epithelial cell population, not in the stromal compartment (Figure S4E). Although we observed significantly decreased tumor cell proliferation within the end-stage tumors of DT-treated Mac/SCID mice, we did not observe significant differences in the ratio of CK8 or CK14 expressing tumor cells (Figure S4F), suggesting that DT treatment did not significantly alter the composition of tumor cell populations. Together, these results suggest that depletion of CD11b + cells during early tumor development resulted in lasting changes in tumor cell proliferation and growth at end-stage.Interestingly, we observed increased areas of tumor cells within the end-stage tumors of DT-treated Mac/SCID mice compared to tumors of either vehicle-treated Mac/SCID or non-transgenic DT-treated mice (Figure S4F), suggestive of changes within the stroma of these tumors. To quantify changes in macrophages that might be present within end-stage tumors of DT-treated Mac/SCID mice, we stained tumor sections for F4/80. No significant differences were observed in F4/80 + macrophages within end-stage tumors of DT-treated Mac/SCID mice compared to vehicle-treated Mac/SCID or non-transgenic DT-treated mice (Figure S4G), indicating that the macrophage population had recovered in end-stage tumors following depletion with DT. However, SMA + CAFs were significantly reduced in tumors of DT-treated Mac/SCID mice compared to either vehicle-treated Mac/SCID or non-transgenic DT-treated mice (Figure 3F), indicating an overall loss in recruitment and/or differentiation of CAFs within these tumors. Consistent with reduced numbers of CAFs, DT-treated Mac/SCID mice demonstrated significantly reduced collagen deposition within end-stage tumors compared to either vehicle-treated Mac/SCID or non-transgenic DT-treated mice, quantified by staining for picrosirius red (Figure 3G), which stains both fibrillar and non-fibrillar collagens, and collagen I (Figure S4H). Together, these results demonstrate that depletion of CD11b + cells early in mammary tumor development resulted in reduced CAFs and collagen deposition.2.4. Myeloid Progenitor Cell Population Is Increased in Early Tumor Development and Is Enriched for FibrocytesCCR2 is expressed on multiple cell types of the myeloid lineage, including monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, and plays a critical role in recruitment of these cells from the bone marrow. To investigate the recruitment of CCR2 + myeloid-lineage cells into tumors, we used SVF/CCL2 stromal cells to humanize the inguinal mammary glands of heterozygous CCR2/SCID mice, which have the CCR2 coding sequence replaced with red fluorescent protein (RFP). We then transplanted human breast epithelial cells transduced with SV40ER and KRasG12V into the humanized mammary glands. Within end-stage tumors, we observed that CD11b + cells comprised approximately 31.5% of the tumor cells, while F4/80 + cells were approximately 21.8% (Figure S5A,B). The majority of CD11b + cells expressed RFP (78.7%), while 20.2% expressed CD11b alone (Figure S5C). These RFP-cells may be consistent with neutrophils. We also observed RFP + cells within the tumor stroma, with a population of RFP + cells having an elongated morphology similar to CAFs (inset, Figure 4A). To investigate these cells further, we co-labeled tumors for RFP and SMA. Within the tumor stroma, we observed elongated cells that co-expressed both markers with a frequency of 8.7 \u00b1 3.9% of SMA + cells (Figure 4B, Figure S5D,E). Similarly, we observed elongated cells within the tumor stroma that co-expressed CD11b and SMA (Figure 4C, Figure S5F).Within the myeloid lineage, fibrocytes are recruited from the bone marrow under conditions of chronic inflammation and fibrosis and differentiate into myofibroblasts. Fibrocytes are identified by expression of myeloid progenitor cell markers coupled with markers for myofibroblasts, including SMA and collagen I. To examine changes in the myeloid progenitor cell population during tumor development, we humanized NOD/SCID mice with either SVF/EV or SVF/CCL2 cells, then transplanted human breast epithelial cells transduced with SV40ER and KRasG12V into the humanized mammary glands. At 1.5 weeks following transplantation, we observed a significant increase in CD45 + CD11b + CD34 + myeloid progenitor cells within SVF/CCL2 transplants compared to SVF/EV transplants (p = 0.02; Figure 4D). Similar to our observations of total CD11b + cells (Figure 2C), no significant difference in myeloid progenitor cells was observed between SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 at 2.5 weeks following transplantation (Figure 4D). To assess changes in myeloid progenitor cells systemically, we isolated bone marrow cells from mice with transplanted mammary glands. At 1.5 weeks following transplantation, no significant difference was observed in myeloid progenitor cells within the bone marrow of SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 transplanted mice (Figure 4E). However, at 2.5 weeks following transplantation, SVF/CCL2 transplanted mice had significantly reduced myeloid progenitor cells within the bone marrow (p = 0.04; Figure 4E), suggestive of recruitment of myeloid progenitor cells out of the bone marrow niche. Taken together, these data suggest that myeloid progenitor cells are recruited from the bone marrow to the transplants of SVF/CCL2 humanized glands early in tumor formation.To further investigate the presence of fibrocytes, CD45 + CD11b + CD34 + myeloid progenitor cells and CD45 + CD11b + CD34-monocytes/macrophages were isolated from transplanted HIM mammary glands using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). When plated in culture, a portion of the myeloid progenitor cell population formed adherent colonies with cellular morphology similar to myofibroblasts, while no colony formation was observed within the monocyte/macrophage population (Figure 4F). This data suggests that a subset of cells within the myeloid progenitor cell population can differentiate into adherent cells and proliferate. These adherent colonies grown in culture co-expressed SMA and collagen I (Figure 4G), consistent with fibrocyte colony formation. The colonies that formed were negative for expression of macrophage marker, F4/80 (data not shown). These data suggest that fibrocytes may contribute to the CAF population within the developing mammary tumors through differentiation into SMA + and collagen I + stromal cells.2.5. Fibrocytes Are PDGFR Responsive CellsPreviously, fibrocytes have been shown to express PDGFR\u03b1 and migrate in response to PDGF-AA signaling. Consistent with this, fibrocyte colonies grown in culture from FACS-isolated mammary myeloid progenitor cells co-expressed PDGFR\u03b1 and SMA (Figure 5A). To examine PDGFR\u03b1 expression within the tumor stroma, sections from end-stage tumor sections from the HIM model were stained for PDGFR\u03b1. Tumors from SVF/CCL2 humanized glands demonstrated significantly increased PDGFR\u03b1 expression compared to tumors from SVF/EV humanized glands (p = 0.03; Figure 5B). Depletion of CD11b + cells in SVF/CCL2 HIM transplanted mice resulted in a significant reduction of PDGFR\u03b1 expression within the stroma of end-stage tumors compared to vehicle-treated Mac/SCID or non-transgenic DT-treated mice (Figure 5C). Together, these results indicate that early increases in CD11b + cells during tumor formation lead to increased PDGFR\u03b1 + stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment.To assess the role of PDGFR\u03b1 in regulating fibrocyte differentiation and growth, we utilized imatinib mesylate, a clinically utilized tyrosine kinase inhibitor of PDGFR, stem cell factor (c-Kit), and Abelson non-receptor tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) that has shown some promise in the treatment of fibrotic diseases. CD11b + cells were sorted from mammary glands using magnetic beads, and sorted cells were then treated in culture with increasing doses of imatinib. After 10 days of treatment with vehicle, 5 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M, or 20 \u00b5M imatinib, fibrocyte colonies were fixed and stained with crystal violet (Figure 5D). Both colony number and colony size were decreased following treatment with imatinib in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5E,F). These results suggest that treatment with imatinib inhibited fibrocyte colony formation through either reduced cellular proliferation or increased apoptosis. In contrast, when isolated CD11b + cells were treated in culture with the selective c-kit inhibitor ISCK03, inhibition of colony number and size were only observed at the 20 \u00b5M dose (Figure S5G). When isolated CD11b + cells were plated in serum-free media supplemented with vehicle or up to 100 ng/mL PDGF-AA, no colony formation was observed (data not shown), suggesting that PDGFR\u03b1 signaling is not sufficient for fibrocyte colony formation and growth. Together, these results suggest that targeted inhibition of fibrocytes may reduce CCL2-induced desmoplasia within breast tumors to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy.3. DiscussionObese mammary adipose tissue demonstrates both increased macrophage-driven inflammation and adipose tissue fibrosis. Obesity is also correlated with desmoplasia in human breast tumors. Understanding the relationship between obesity-associated inflammation and tumor desmoplasia is challenging, because obesity induces both local and systemic changes that could contribute to fibrosis. Here, we use the HIM model to examine inflammation induced by CCL2, which is significantly increased in obese adipose tissue, and the consequences within developing mammary tumors. A strength of this model is that transformed human breast epithelial cells progress through stages of breast cancer growth in a similar time frame, allowing for temporal examination of early tumor progression. We observed that elevated recruitment of macrophages into developing tumors led to increased collagen deposition within end-stage tumors (Figure S5H). This was associated with an increase in myeloid progenitor cells, containing fibrocytes, a cell population which expresses markers for both myeloid-lineage immune cells and myofibroblasts. Although fibrocytes are a relatively rare immune cell population, these cells may be enhanced in the context of obesity, as increases in circulating myeloid progenitor cells have been observed in obese patients. In cancer, fibrocytes have been found to contribute to tumor fibrosis as well as resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies. Fibrocytes may be an important therapeutic target to reduce tumor desmoplasia and treatment-resistance in obese patients with breast cancer.Within the tumor microenvironment, CAFs comprise a large portion of breast tumor stroma. CAFs are a heterogeneous population of cells, and CAF populations expressing different markers may arise from various cells of origin. Although not well-examined in the context of cancer, fibrocytes may contribute to CAF populations. Within tumors of the HIM model mice, we observed SMA + stromal cells that also expressed CD11b and CCR2, suggestive of differentiating fibrocytes. Fibrocytes within tissues are challenging to identify, as specific markers do not exist for this cell population. Fibrocyte cells express markers consistent with myeloid progenitor cells, which are thought to be the cells of origin. However, following differentiation, fibrocytes may lose immune cell markers and become indistinguishable from resident tissue fibroblasts. Consistent with these observations, RFP expression controlled by the CCR2 promoter may be lost during differentiation of fibrocytes within tumors. In breast cancer specimens, CD34 expression is reduced and SMA expression is increased within the stroma of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ, which may reflect differentiation of fibrocytes within the developing tumor stroma. Although we observed that fibrocytes expressed PDGFR\u03b1 in culture, PDGFR\u03b1 is also expressed by mammary fibroblasts, and this marker may identify CAFs arising from multiple origins. Lineage tracing approaches to examine fibrocytes in wound healing, such as the Vav-Cre model, which directs cre recombinase expression under control of the promoter for pan-hematopoietic cell-specific protein Vav-1, may enhance the identification of fibrocyte-derived CAF populations.Cancer has been described as a wound that will not heal. In the context of wound healing, macrophages secrete multiple soluble mediators that stimulate local and recruited myofibroblasts to differentiate and facilitate wound closure and synthesis of extracellular matrix. This function of macrophages may be critical in developing tumors to form the supportive tumor stroma. We observed that early depletion of CD11b + myeloid lineage cells resulted in the disruption of CAF formation and collagen deposition within the end-stage tumor stroma, suggesting a critical role for these myeloid lineage cells in early tumor growth that is not replicated by tumor cells. Similar results were observed with the growth of Lewis lung carcinoma cells in macrophage-deficient op/op mice. Macrophages can also produce collagen family members and have themselves been implicated in collagen remodeling in tumors, as well as during mammary gland development and involution. We also observed the emergence of CD11b + fibrocytes, which may also enhance collagen deposition within developing tumors. Macrophages may promote fibrocyte differentiation through local secretion and activation of TGF\u03b21. Similar to macrophages, CAFs within the tumor microenvironment may enhance fibrocyte differentiation, potentially though secretion of the proteoglycan, lumican. Although myeloid progenitor cells are thought to be the cells of origin of fibrocytes, others have described a macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition in renal fibrosis, indicating that multiple pathways may exist for myeloid lineage cell contribution to the CAF population. Increased understanding of interactions among stromal cells may improve strategies to therapeutically target the tumor microenvironment.Within the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages are thought to promote tumor growth through angiogenesis as well as through secretion of multiple cytokines implicated in enhancing aggressive tumor cell populations. In breast cancer, CD68 + tumor-associated macrophages are correlated with Ki67 expression in epithelial cells, suggesting that increased numbers of macrophages enhance tumor cell proliferation. Following early depletion of CD11b + myeloid lineage cells, we observed a significant reduction in tumor cell expression of Ki67, decreased numbers of mitotic figures and diminished tumor growth rates. It is tempting to speculate that depletion of macrophages during tumor development had a direct impact on tumor cell populations, possibly through secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines. However, this depletion of myeloid lineage cells also led to reductions in CAF number and collagen deposition within end-stage tumors, while macrophage number was not significantly different at end-stage. CAFs have also been implicated in promoting cancer cell proliferation within tumors. Although both tumor-associated macrophages and CAFs secrete factors that enhance tumor cell proliferation, the loss of collagen could also significantly impact tumor growth. Tumor stiffening due to increased extracellular matrix deposition and collagen crosslinking has been implicated in promoting proliferation and invasion of mammary tumor cells through mechanical signaling. Further studies are necessary to determine whether the reduced proliferation of tumor cells was a direct or indirect effect of myeloid lineage depletion. However, these studies suggest that chemoprevention strategies targeting the microenvironment early in tumor formation could reduce the aggressiveness of tumors that form regardless of genetic abnormalities present within the tumor cells.Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is a clinically available receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia patients long-term with limited side effects. Unfortunately, phase I clinical trials suggested that imatinib alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents did not significantly improve survival outcomes in patients with treatment-resistant metastatic breast cancer. However, imatinib has significant anti-fibrotic effects through inhibition of PDGFR signaling as well as by blocking c-Abl upregulation of TGF\u03b21 pathways, resulting in effects such as reduced human breast fibroblast-mediated collagen deposition. In a preclinical model of pulmonary fibrosis, imatinib reduced recruitment of fibrocytes to the lungs, and we observed that imatinib also decreased the ability of fibrocytes to form colonies in vitro, suggesting that imatinib may inhibit fibrocyte-mediated fibrosis. Currently, imatinib is in clinical trials for treatment of multiple fibrotic conditions. Obesity enhances adipose tissue fibrosis, and in a preclinical model, treatment of obese mice with imatinib significantly reduced inflammation, enhanced adipogenesis, and diminished adipose tissue fibrosis. Obese breast cancer patients may benefit from adjuvant treatment with imatinib to reduce fibrosis within breast tumors. Further studies to identify the contribution of fibrocytes to CAF populations with breast tumors may lead to improved treatment strategies to reduce desmoplasia in breast tumors of obese patients and enhance chemotherapeutic responses.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Human Breast TissueAll human breast tissues were obtained in compliance with the laws and institutional guidelines, as approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Human Subjects Assurance Number: FWA00005399). De-identified, non-cancerous breast tissues were obtained from patients undergoing elective reduction mammoplasty with informed consent through the BioBank (Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA). These studies were categorized as \u201cnot human subjects research.\u201d Patient data were limited to date of service, body mass index, and age.4.2. Transgenic MiceAll animal procedures were conducted in compliance with a protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and housed and handled in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in AAALAC accredited facilities (Animal Welfare Assurance Number: D16-00239). NOD/SCID (001303), SCID (001913), DTR CD11b-EGFP (008547), and CCR2-RFP (017586) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). DTR CD11b and CCR2-RFP mice were crossed with SCID mice to generate DTR CD11b-EGFP/SCID (Mac/SCID) and CCR2-RFP/SCID (CCR2/SCID) mice homozygous for the SCID transgene. Genotyping was performed by Transnetyx (Cordova, TN, USA). Mice were given food and water ad libitum.4.3. Human-in-Mouse ModelSVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 breast stromal cell lines were generated from the SVF of human reduction mammoplasty tissue as described. To humanize mice, endogenous mammary epithelium was removed from the fourth mammary glands of 3-week-old female NOD/SCID, Mac/SCID, or CCR2/SCID mice and either SVF/EV or SVF/CCL2 cells were injected into the fat pad as described. Two weeks following humanization, epithelial cells were isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues, transduced overnight with lentiviruses encoding oncogenes KRasG12V and SV40ER, and transplanted into the humanized area of mammary fat pads with SVF/EV or SVF/CCL2 cells, as previously described. Briefly, lentiviral particles encoding pLenti 7.3 vector (ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA; V53406), pLenti-KRasG12V-GFP, and pLenti-SV40 ER-blasticidin were generated and concentrated as described. Reduction mammoplasty tissues were enzymatically digested as described, the epithelial organoids were dissociated to single cells and transduced in suspension with lentivirus with a multiplicity of infection of 3. Transduced epithelial cells (1 \u00d7 105/gland) were mixed with either SVF/EV or SVF/CCL2 cells (2.5 \u00d7 105/gland) in a 1:1 mixture of 2 mg/mL rat tail collagen (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA; 354236) and Matrigel (Corning, Inc; Corning, NY, USA; 35428) and injected into the humanized fat pads. Transplants were collected at early time points of 1.5 or 2.5 weeks following transplantation or at end-stage when tumors reached 1 cm in diameter. For CD11b + cell depletion, mice were treated with 12.5 mg/kg of diphtheria toxin (DT, Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis, MO, USA; D0564) in 2 doses injected subcutaneously 24 h apart starting 1.5 weeks after epithelial cell transplant. To examine depletion of CD11b + cells, Mac/SCID mice were treated with vehicle or DT, and mammary tissue and bone marrow were collected 24 h after the second dose. HIM model experiments were repeated 3 times with epithelial cells isolated from 3 different reduction mammoplasty samples.4.4. Isolation of Cells From Mammary GlandsMammary tissue collected 1.5 and 2.5 weeks post-transplant and end-stage tumors were mechanically minced then enzymatically dissociated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C in media composed of DMEM/F-12 (Corning Inc.; Corning, NY, USA; 10-090-CV) supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich; I0516), 0.5 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA; H0888), 10 ng/mL human epidermal growth factor (hEGF, Sigma-Aldrich; E9644), 5% calf serum, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Corning, Inc.; Corning, NY, USA; 30-004-CI) with 1.5 mg/mL collagenase A (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA; COLLA-RO) and 125 U/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA; H3506). Following digestion, the tissue was left to settle at room temperature for 10 min. The surface lipid layer was discarded. Red blood cells were lysed using ACK Lysing Buffer (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland; 10-548E). Epithelial organoids were dissociated to single cells using 0.25% Trypsin, 0.1% EDTA (Corning; 25-053-CI) at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 50 \u00b5g/mL DNase (Millipore Sigma; St. Louis, MO, USA; 10104159001). Cells were then passed through a 40 \u00b5m Falcon cell strainer (Corning, Inc.; Corning, NY, USA; 352340). All cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2.4.5. Flow Cytometry and FACS IsolationIsolated cells from mammary glands and bone marrow were stained at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (1:1000; ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA; 65-0865) followed by blocking of the Fc receptors with unconjugated CD16/32 antibodies at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min (0.5 ng/\u00b5L; ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA; 14-0161-85). Cells were resuspended at 1 \u00d7 107/mL, then incubated with BV421 CD34 (16 ng/\u00b5L; BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA; 562608), APC CD11b (2.5 ng/\u00b5L; ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA; 17-0112-82), and PE CD45 (2.5 ng/\u00b5L; ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA; 12-0451-82) in PBS with 2% FBS at 4 \u00b0C for 45 min. Bone marrow cells isolated from DT-treated mice were stained with Fixable Viability Dye, blocked with CD16/32 antibodies, then incubated with APC CD11b antibodies. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on a BD FACS Aria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA, USA). Gates were set using fluorescence-minus-one controls. Flow cytometry data from early time point transplanted mammary glands were analyzed with a fold change relative to cells isolated from SVF/EV transplants. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software package version 10 (Becton, Dickinson and Company; Ashland, OR, USA).4.6. Magnetic Bead Sorting and Fibrocyte CultureFor magnetic bead sorting, CD11b antibody (0.1 \u00b5g/\u00b5L; ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA; 14-0112-85) was rotated with magnetic beads (ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA; 11035) at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Beads were washed and resuspended, then incubated with dissociated cells resuspended at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 2 mM EDTA with 100 \u00b5L beads/1 \u00d7 107 cells. Cells and beads were mixed with rotation at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. Bead-conjugated cells were isolated with a magnet, then plated at 20,000 cells/well on 24-well plates. Cells were treated with PBS or imatinib mesylate (AdooQ Bioscience, Irvine, CA, USA; A10468) or DMSO or ISCK03 (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; 73732) at 5 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M, or 20 \u00b5M for 10 days, with a media/treatment change on day 5. Cells were fixed in 100% cold methanol for 15 min at \u221220 \u00b0C followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Wells were imaged with a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope, and ImageJ software was used to quantify both colony number and colony size. FACS-isolated myeloid progenitor cells (CD45 + CD11b + CD34 +) and monocytes/macrophages (CD45 + CD11b + CD34-) from developing mammary tumors were plated at 500 cells/well on 8-well chamber slides (ThermoFisher; 15434) coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; P4707) and grown for 10 days. All sorted cells were grown in triplicate in MesenCult Expansion Kit Media (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; 05513) in at least 3 experiments.4.7. Histology and ImmunofluorescenceTissue was paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Masson\u2019s trichrome by the Experimental Animal Pathology Laboratory (Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Madison, WI, USA). Picrosirius red staining was completed as described. Immunofluorescence was performed as described. Primary antibodies included F4/80 (1:250; Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; 123101), \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA; 1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO, USA; A5228), collagen I (1:500; Abcam; Cambridge, MA, USA; ab34710), Ki67 (1:200; Abcam; ab15580), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1; 1:200; ThermoFisher; Waltham MA, USA; PA5-16742), CD11b (1:100; Novus; Centennial, CO, USA; NB110-89474), green fluorescent protein (GFP; 1:200; Abcam; Cambridge, MA, USA; ab13970), red fluorescent protein (RFP; 1:50; Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.; Limerick, PA, USA; 200-101-379), cytokeratin 8 (CK8; 1:500; Agilent; Santa Clara, CA, USA; M3652), cytokeratin 14 (CK14; 1:500; ThermoFisher; Waltham, MA, USA; RB-9020), SV40 T antigen (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Dallas, TX, USA; sc-147). Secondary antibodies were obtained from ThermoFisher (Waltham, MA, USA) and included Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (A11001), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG (A11006), Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (A11030), Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (A11010). Sections were counterstained with 25 \u00b5g/mL 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min. Slides were then treated with the TrueView Autofluorescence Quenching Kit (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA, USA; SP-8400) at room temperature for 5 min, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and mounted using Vectashield Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA, USA; H-1700).Tissue sections were blinded and then imaged using a Leica TCS SP8 Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) or Nikon Eclipse E600 Microscope and QICAM Fast 1394 camera (Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, NY, USA). Stained slides for quantification were stained and imaged in parallel with identical image acquisition settings and exposure times. Five images were taken from each tissue section. Area of staining was quantified using Image J software using the whole image. Staining was assessed by setting a threshold using the thresholding tool. Thresholding tool settings were set and duplicated on all tissues in the groups compared. For Ki67 staining, labeled nuclei and total nuclei were counted in each image using the cell counter plug-in. For fibrocyte colonies, the freehand selection tool was used to trace the border of crystal violet-stained colonies, followed by use of the analyze/measure function.4.8. Quantitative RT-PCRDissociated tumor cells from primary SVF/EV and SVF/CCL2 tumors were isolated based on GFP expression using FACS. RNA was isolated from tumor cells using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD, USA; 74104). RNA was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosciences, Waltham, MA, USA; 4368814) and Techne Thermal Cycler. Quantitative PCR was performed using iTaq SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad; 172-5121) with a Bio-Rad CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA, USA). Transcripts were normalized to housekeeping gene GAPDH. Data were analyzed using the \u2206Cq method. Primers for CCL2 are F: 5\u2032 GAGAGGCTGAGACTAACCCAGA and R: 5\u2032ATCACAGCTTCTTTGGGACACT, and GAPDH are F: 5\u2032 GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT and R: 5\u2032 TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG.4.9. Statistical Analysisp-Values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. Data were tested for normality using Bartlett\u2019s test prior to further statistical analysis. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 s.e.m. unless otherwise stated. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism v.8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).5. ConclusionsObesity is significantly correlated with diminished breast cancer responses to chemotherapy, which may occur in part due to increased breast tumor desmoplasia. Under conditions of obesity, adipocytes increase CCL2 expression, leading to elevated recruitment of inflammatory macrophages. Within the tumor microenvironment, we observed that elevated CCL2 expression enhanced recruitment of macrophages during early tumor growth, followed temporally by significant increases in CAF formation and collagen deposition. Depletion of macrophages led to significant reductions in tumor growth, CAF number, and collagen deposition. Understanding how macrophages contribute to CAF formation during early tumor progression may lead to new chemoprevention strategies to reduce breast tumor growth and progression for at-risk obese women. We also identified that CCL2 expression increased recruitment of myeloid progenitor cells into growing tumors. The myeloid progenitor cell population contained fibrocytes, which were inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate in vitro.

This microenvironment provides all the necessary stimuli for tumour survival, growth, and invasiveness. Inflammatory cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines they produce are essential components of this microenvironment.Monocytes originating from blood differentiate into either M1 or M2 subtype macrophages, depending on the environmental stimuli they receive. Human M1 macrophages demonstrate elevated expressions of CD14, CD16, CD64, CD86, and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR\u03b1; whereas, CD163 and CD206 are markers associated with M2 macrophages. In breast cancer, macrophages represent up to 50% of the tumour mass and there exists a correlation between the number of tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) and poor prognosis. Macrophages have roles in almost all stages of tumour progression. In the primary tumour, they stimulate angiogenesis and facilitate invasion. During metastasis, macrophages prepare the pre-metastatic site and promote tumour cell dissemination as well as growth. They also generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment by disrupting natural killer (NK) and T cell functions. TAMs usually resemble M2 macrophages. During tumour development, tumour-infiltrating M1-polarized macrophages are generally identified by an IL-12high IL-10low phenotype and they enhance immune reactions that display anti-tumour effects. During late-stages of tumour progression, TAMs generally skew to an M2-like phenotype that is characterized by an IL-12low IL-10high phenotype and diminished tumouricidal activity. The identification of molecules driving macrophage plasticity in the cancer microenvironment could provide a basis for macrophage-focused diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Fibroblasts are one of the most abundant cell types found in the tumour stroma. Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. As tumours are described as \u201cwounds that never heal\u201d, CAFs are very similar to myofibroblasts, which are spindle shaped activated fibroblasts. Although there is no specific marker that is exclusively expressed by CAFs, alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) is widely used as a CAF marker. CAFs not only play an active role in tumour initiation and progression, but also sculpt the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as regulators of immune cell recruitment as well as functions. Studies in breast cancer investigating the effects of stromal fibroblasts on monocytes/macrophages are very limited. In this study, we report for the first time that CAFs obtained from invasive breast cancer differentiated monocytes to M2-like pro-tumoural macrophages in terms of both phenotypic features and functions, in contrast to fibroblasts obtained from normal breast. We also demonstrated that CAFs were very effective in recruiting monocytes. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) were found to be crucial monocyte chemotactic cytokines that were secreted from stromal cells.ResultsCAFs, which are \u03b1-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to NFs, effectively recruit monocytesCAFs are \u03b1-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to NFs. CAFs and NFs were cultured in 8-well chamber slides, then stained for vimentin (A,D), pan-cytokeratin (B,E) and \u03b1-SMA (C,F). Both CAF and NF cells were positive for vimentin and negative for pan-cytokeratin. However, CAFs were positive for \u03b1-SMA, unlike NFs. Sup. Figure\u00a01 displays immunocytochemical stainings for fibroblast activation protein (FAP). One representative figure for each cell type is shown (\u00d7100).CAFs were isolated from breast cancer tissues obtained from patients undergoing mastectomy. As healthy counterparts, we used normal fibroblasts (NFs) isolated from normal breast tissues obtained from patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty. Primary cultures of both of those isolated fibroblasts were established. All fibroblasts utilized in the experiments were characterized by vimentin, pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-SMA expressions by immunocytochemistry. They differed in their expressions of \u03b1-SMA, which was consistently negative in NFs (n\u2009=\u20093) and positive in CAFs (n\u2009=\u20094). Representative figures of NFs and CAFs are shown in Fig.\u00a01.CAF and MDA-MB-231 cells effectively recruit monocytes. Monocytes isolated from healthy donors were serum starved and then were allowed to migrate for 5\u2009h toward CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) Representative microscopic views of each condition are shown (i: Standard Medium, ii: CM from NFs, iii: CM from CAFs, iv: CM from MDA-MB-231 Cells). (B) CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in monocyte migration more than NFs did. The presence of CXCR4 (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml) or MCP-1 (130\u2009\u00b5g/ml) blocking antibodies diminished monocyte recruitment. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. standard medium, #p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. each corresponding control. Arrows demonstrate migrated/counted monocytes.In order to evaluate the effects of CAFs and breast cancer cells on monocyte recruitment, we performed cell migration assays. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy humans. Conditioned mediums (CMs) collected from CAFs, NFs, and breast cancer cells were used in a Boyden migration assay, in which monocytes migrate toward CM in the bottom chamber. Our results demonstrated that CAFs as well as breast cancer cells recruited monocytes effectively (Fig.\u00a02A,B).Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by MCP-1 as well as SDF-1 cytokinesIn order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying monocyte recruitment by CAFs, we focused on MCP-1 and SDF-1 cytokines. Our results showed that inhibiting MCP-1 or SDF-1 activity through MCP-1 or CXCR4 (a chemokine receptor specific for SDF-1) blocking antibodies, respectively, reduced monocyte migration, significantly. Although both SDF-1 and MCP-1 are relevant for monocyte recruitment mediated by both CAF and breast cancer cells; SDF-1 seems to be more important for CAF-induced monocyte recruitment, while MCP-1 is more prominent for breast cancer cell mediated monocyte migration (Fig.\u00a02B).CAFs induce a pro-tumoural phenotype, which resembles M2 macrophages like TAMs, in monocytes/macrophages in contrast to NFsCAF and MDA-MB-231 cells induce monocytes to differentiate into a M2 phenotype similar to TAMs. CD14+ PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured with CMs from NFs (NF-educated monocytes), CAFs (CAF-educated monocytes), MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes) or standard culture medium DMEM (control monocytes) for 7 days, then were analysed using flow cytometry. (A) The expression levels of PD-1, CD163, and CD206 were significantly higher in CAF-educated monocytes than in NF-educated monocytes. The expression levels of HLA-DR and CD14 were significantly lower in CAF-educated monocytes than in NF-educated monocytes. Representative histograms of each molecule are shown. (B) Data are presented as relative fold changes to control IgG in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.We established an in vitro model utilizing CD14+ cells isolated from healthy donors and CMs obtained from CAFs, NFs, and breast cancer cells in order to investigate the effects of the tumour stromal cells as well as the tumour cells on monocyte differentiation. Following 7 days of culture, the expressions of CD163 and CD206, which are mostly associated with M2 macrophages, were higher in CAF-educated cells than in NF-educated cells. In addition, the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was higher in CAF-educated cells than in NF-educated cells. In fact, NF-educated cells\u2019 expressions of PD-1, CD163 and CD206 were similar to control monocytes. On the other hand, the expression of CD14 was much higher in NF-educated cells than in CAF-educated cells. In addition, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR) expression of CAF-educated cells is much lower than that of NF-educated cells as well as breast cancer cell-educated monocytes. The expressions of CD86 were comparable between the groups (Fig.\u00a03).CAF-educated monocytes exhibit strong immunosuppressionCAF-educated monocytes suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation more than NF-educated monocytes did. CAF-educated monocytes, NF-educated monocytes, MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes, control monocytes were co-cultured with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelled and autologous CD4+ T cells that were activated by CD3/CD28 magnetic beads for 96\u2009hours. (A) The proliferation of T cells was suppressed by CAF-educated monocytes more strongly than control and NF-educated monocytes. Suppression of T-cell proliferation by CAF-educated monocytes is E:T dependent (normalized percentage of suppression of T-cell proliferation considering respective control monocytes are 40.1% and 53.3% for 1:4 and 1:2 E:Ts, respectively). (B) Representative histograms of the proliferation of T cells (monocytes:CD4+ T cells, 1:4). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.We investigated whether CAF-educated monocytes could inhibit T-cell proliferation. For this purpose, human autologous CD4+ peripheral T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads were co-cultured with control monocytes, NF-, or CAF-educated monocytes. As shown in Fig.\u00a04, CAF-educated monocytes markedly suppressed T-cell proliferation in effector-cell-to-target-cell-ratio (E:T) dependent manner; since a higher E:T seems to result in a more prominent immunosuppression (Fig.\u00a04B).CAF-educated monocytes enhance the motility of breast cancer cellsCAF-educated monocytes induce increased motility of MDA-MB-231 cells. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for 24\u2009hours. (A) Representative microscopic views of tumour cells that show invasion are shown (i: Standard Medium, ii: CM from Control Monocytes, iii: CM from CAF-educated Monocytes, iv: CM from NF-educated Monocytes, v: CM from MDA-MB-231-educated Monocytes). (B) Tumour cells that show invasion were counted and presented in bar graphs. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. standard medium. Arrows demonstrate counted tumour cells that show invasion.CAF-educated monocytes modify the expressions of EMT-related proteins and genes. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for 24\u2009hours. (A\u2013D) The effects of NF-, CAF- or MDA-MB-231-educated monocyte CMs on the EMT of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were analysed by Western blot analysis of vimentin and E-cadherin proteins. Densitometry shows relative protein expression normalized for GAPDH (n\u2009=\u20093). (E\u2013G) The effects of NF-, CAF- or MDA-MB-231-educated monocyte CMs on the EMT of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR of Snail, Slug and Twist gene expressions (n\u2009=\u20093). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. **p\u2009<\u20090.01. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001. ns: not significant.In order to investigate the effects of CAF-educated monocytes on the motility of breast cancer cells, we treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with CMs from CAF-, NF-, or MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes. The invasion of breast cancer cells was enhanced by the effects of CAF-educated monocytes (similar to MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes), whereas the invasion of breast cancer cells was not significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of control monocytes (Fig.\u00a05). In addition, we investigated the changes in expressions of EMT-related proteins of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes. For this reason, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with CMs from CAF-, NF-, or MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes. Vimentin expression was found to be increased and E-cadherin expression was found to be decreased in breast cancer cells by the effects of CAF-educated monocytes. On the contrary, neither vimentin nor E-cadherin expression was significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of control monocytes (Fig.\u00a06A\u2013D). Real-time qPCR results showed that CAF-educated monocytes induce breast cancer cell expressions of Snail, Slug and Twist genes; which are EMT-related genes, both compared with control monocytes and with NF-educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a06E\u2013G).CAFs re-direct differentiated M1 macrophages to M2-like macrophagesCAF and MDA-MB-231 cells induce M1 macrophages to differentiate into M2-like macrophages. (A) M1 macrophages were subsequently cultured with CMs from CAFs or MDA-MB-231 cells. After 48\u2009hours, cells were analysed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of CD163 and CD206 were significantly higher in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages than in M1 macrophages alone. Representative histograms of each molecule are shown. (B) Data are presented as relative fold changes to control IgG in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. (C) M1 macrophages were cultured alone or with CMs from CAFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells for 48\u2009hours and the levels of IL-12 or IL-10 were measured by ELISA. Levels of IL-12 was decreased in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages compared with that in M1 macrophages alone. In contrast, levels of IL-10 increased in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages compared with that in M1 macrophages alone. *p\u2009<\u20090.05.We then set out to explore whether CAFs were able to induce the differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. For this reason, we cultured M1 macrophages with CMs of CAFs as well as breast cancer cells. After 2 days, the expression of CD163 significantly increased in M1 macrophages treated with CMs of either CAFs or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; as a result, resembling the surface expression of M2 macrophages (Fig.\u00a07). Even though CD206 expressions of CAF- or breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages slightly increased, such increases were not found to be statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07B); whereas, CD206 expression of CAF-educated monocytes was shown to increase significantly (Fig.\u00a03B). In addition, we determined IL-10 and IL-12 cytokine levels in culture supernatants. IL-12 cytokine levels decreased in the supernatants of both CAF- and breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages. On the other hand, IL-10 cytokine levels seem to have slightly increased in the supernatants of both CAF- and breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages, although this increase was not found to be statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07C).High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in breast cancer tissue samplesCorrelation between the number of macrophages positive for CD163, and CD206 as well as \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts in breast tumour stroma with clinical and pathological features.\tNo. of cases\tCAF grade\u2021\tCD163+ macrophages*\tCD206+ macrophages*\t \tLow (n\u2009=\u200927)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200923)\tp value\u2020\tLow (n\u2009=\u200925)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200925)\tp value\u2020\tLow (n\u2009=\u200928)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200922)\tp value\u2020\t \tAge\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u226450\t27\t16\t11\t0.57\t16\t11\t0.25\t13\t14\t0.26\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>50\t23\t11\t12\t\t9\t14\t\t15\t8\t\t \tGrade\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\t8\t6\t2\t0.26\t7\t1\t0.04\t3\t5\t0.27\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\t42\t21\t21\t\t18\t24\t\t25\t17\t\t \tKi-67 index#\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u22645%\t4\t4\t0\t0.02\t4\t0\t0.03\t3\t1\t0.60\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>5%\t25\t8\t17\t\t9\t16\t\t13\t12\t\t \tLymph node involment\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Negative\t26\t13\t13\t0.58\t13\t13\t1.00\t16\t10\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Positive\t24\t14\t10\t\t12\t12\t\t12\t12\t\t \tTumor size\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u22642\u2009cm\t17\t13\t4\t0.03\t13\t4\t0.01\t9\t8\t0.77\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>2\u2009cm\t33\t14\t19\t\t12\t21\t\t19\t14\t\t \tMolecular subtypes\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ER/PR(+)\t16\t10\t6\t0.66\t9\t7\t0.09\t8\t8\t0.44\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HER2(+)\t11\t6\t5\t\t8\t3\t\t8\t3\t\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Triple negative\t23\t11\t12\t\t8\t15\t\t12\t11\t\t \t*The median values of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophage numbers in stroma within the areas were used to divide the patients into high and low grade groups.\u2021The grades of CAF area in stroma were used to divide the patients into two groups (low and high grade).#Ki-67 index was evaluated in 29 tissue samples.\u2020Data were analysed by Fisher\u2019s exact test and chi-squared test, and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.We analysed the presence of macrophages positive for CD163 and CD206 as well as \u03b1-SMA positive fibroblasts in 50 human breast cancer samples using immunohistochemistry. We divided the sample group into high and low grade groups based on the median number of CD163+ macrophages (64; range 18\u2212151), and CD206+ macrophages (15; range 2\u201350). We then analysed the associations of TAM grade with clinical and pathological features (Table\u00a01). High level of infiltration of stromal CD163+ macrophages was associated with higher histologic grade, higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. High CAF grade was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume (Table\u00a01).High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in breast cancer tissue samples. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD163, CD206, \u03b1-SMA, and Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) in breast cancer samples are shown. \u03b1-SMA (A), CD163 (B), CD206 (C), and H&E (D) were stained in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissue sample. \u03b1-SMA (E), CD163 (F), CD206 (G), and H&E (H) were stained in a HER2+ breast cancer tissue sample. \u03b1-SMA (I), CD163 (J), CD206 (K), and H&E (L) were stained in an ER+PR+ breast cancer tissue sample (\u00d7400; scale bar, 50\u2009\u00b5m).

Indeed, we found that high grade CAF tissues harboured higher numbers of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophages (Fig.\u00a08A\u2013D and Table\u00a02). In addition, low CAF grade was associated with lower numbers of CD163+or CD206+ macrophages (Fig.\u00a08I\u2013L, Table\u00a02).CAF-educated monocytes increased the proliferation of breast cancer cellsCAF-educated monocytes induce increased proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF or CAF cells. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. (A) Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were evaluated with MTT assay after 48\u2009hours of treatment with corresponding CMs and normalized cell numbers are shown (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, n\u2009=\u20093). (B) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in an ACEA E-plate. After a day of incubation, they were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for an additional 48\u2009hours. Cell index was measured by electrical impedance (n\u2009=\u20093). Normalized cell index (22:26:25, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) as a measure for cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells that were treated with NF- (blue) or CAF-educated (red) monocyte CMs is shown. Vertical line demonstrates the time of normalization. **p\u2009<\u20090.01. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001. ns: not significant.In order to investigate the effects of CAF-educated monocytes on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, we treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with CMs from CAF- or NF- educated monocytes. CAF-educated monocytes increased the proliferation of breast cancer cells. On the other hand, the proliferation of breast cancer cells was not significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a09A). Similar findings concerning the effects of NF- and CAF- educated monocytes on breast cancer cell proliferation were observed in real-time and label-free analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with the xCELLigence system (Fig.\u00a09B).DiscussionIt is now clear that there is a continual crosstalk not only between tumour cells and immune cells but also between stromal cells such as CAFs and immune cells. This crosstalk has an important role on development and progression of tumours. CAFs have recently been implicated in regulation of immune cell recruitment and function. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of cancer associated fibroblasts, compared with normal fibroblasts and breast cancer cells, on monocyte recruitment and polarization in breast cancer.The perspective concerning adult tissue macrophages being solely derived from bone marrow precursor cells have been recently abandoned. In fact, it has been shown that most tissue resident macrophages originated from yolk sac precursor cells. On the other hand, macrophages found in pathogen associated inflammation mostly originate from bone marrow monocytes. It has recently been show that most TAM sub-populations emerge from the Ly6C+ population of circulating mouse monocytes in grafted tumours, primary mouse mammary tumours and in lung metastases. Therefore, investigating the factors associated with monocyte recruitment to tumour tissues has utmost importance. Previous studies have shown that CAFs secrete large amounts of SDF-1. We found that CAF derived SDF-1 was crucial for monocyte recruitment, which underlines the key importance of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis for progression of several cancers. Previous studies have also shown that MCP-1 was able to induce infiltration of blood monocytes into CAF spheroids and to recruit monocytes into mammary tumours. Even though CAF-induced monocyte migration decreased with MCP-1 inhibition in our study, this decrease was not as prominent as that seen with SDF-1 inhibition. This finding demonstrated that SDF-1 is more significant in CAF-induced monocyte chemotaxis than MCP-1.Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that is upregulated on activated T cells for the induction of immune tolerance. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have been shown to be effective against several types of cancer. In a very recent study, Gordon et al. have shown that PD-1 is also expressed by both mouse and human TAMs in addition to activated T cells. They also characterized PD-1+ TAMs and showed that almost all PD-1+ TAMs express an M2-like surface profile. In light of this important study, we investigated whether CAFs might have a role in inducing such immunosuppressive PD-1+ TAMs. The role of CAFs in the induction of PD-1 expression on TAMs have not been investigated before. We found that CAF-educated monocytes demonstrated high PD-1 expression as well as CD163 and CD206 expressions. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that CAFs are able to induce a PD-1+ TAM phenotype by themselves, even without the presence of tumour cells. In addition, our findings prove that CAFs are as potent as tumour cells in terms of inducing such PD-1 expressions (Fig.\u00a03). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that PD-1+ TAMs are relevant for breast cancer in addition to colorectal cancer. In line with these findings, we suggest that CAFs may recruit monocytes and induce these recruited monocytes to differentiate into PD-1 expressing M2-like macrophages, instead of M1 macrophages. Therefore, PD-1 axis might be crucial in CAF induced immune suppression in vivo in several types of cancer including breast and colorectal tumours.In the current study, we also showed that CAF-educated monocytes exhibited increased expression of CD206 and CD163. Immune functions of CD206 (C-Type Mannose Receptor 1) has not yet been fully understood. It has been shown that the lack of CD206 results in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production during endotoxemic lung inflammation in mice and increased serum levels of inflammatory proteins, suggesting that it may have a role in the resolution of inflammation by decreasing inflammatory molecules in the blood. CAF mediated induction of higher expression of CD206, which has anti-inflammatory effects, on monocytes may also demonstrate another indirect mechanism of immune suppression by CAFs. CD163 is a haptoglobin-hemoglobin scavenger receptor and it correlates with known prognostic factors (e.g. poor differentiation (Grade 3), ER negativity and ductal type which are associated with bad prognosis). As one would expect, CAFs induced a very high CD163 expression on monocytes compared with NFs (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, we found that breast cancer cells induced high CD163 and CD206 expressions on monocytes as well as MHC class II (HLA-DR) expression; whereas CAFs did not induce HLA-DR expression on monocytes. HLA-DR is well known to be associated with M1 macrophages. The induction of HLA-DR expression on monocytes by breast cancer cells may seem controversial; however, the study by Edin et al. has shown that colorectal cancer cells induce TAMs of a \u201cmixed\u201d M1/M2 phenotype, which in turn could contribute to a \u201cgood inflammatory response\u201d. Moreover, Helm et al. have demonstrated that HLA-DR and CD163 double positive cells were detectable by immunohistochemical stainings in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues. We propose that CAF-mediated down regulation of MHC class II expression on monocytes may demonstrate a mechanism of immune escape via decreased antigen presentation, in addition to confirming the notion that CAFs are not implicated in any types of \u201cgood inflammatory response\u201d. On the other hand, it should also be noted that NF-educated monocytes expressed both CD14 and HLA-DR, which are associated with M1 macrophages, more than CAF-educated monocytes. This finding shows that activated tumour stroma may have explicit functions in terms of macrophage polarization. In line with our findings, Zhang et al. demonstrated that the number of CD68+CD163+ macrophages was higher in breast cancer tissues than in normal breast tissues.Several studies showed that TAMs promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis by releasing a variety of cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrated that CAF-educated monocytes increased breast cancer cell invasion as well as the expressions of EMT-related genes and vimentin protein significantly, while decreasing E-cadherin protein expression; in contrast to NF-educated monocytes. Our in vitro migration assay findings and gene/protein expression results display that CAF-educated monocytes enhance the motility of breast cancer cells. In a very recent study by Linde et al., CD206+ macrophages were shown to downregulate E-cadherin junctions in breast cancer cells, which may facilitate EMT. Thus, our findings support the notion that CAFs promote EMT, invasion and metastasis; via inducing M2 macrophages. We then investigated whether CAF-educated monocytes have immunosuppressive features. CAF-educated monocytes significantly suppressed T cell proliferation in contrast to control or NF-educated monocytes. CAFs were known to directly inhibit proliferation of T lymphocytes. In the current study, we showed that CAFs also exert immunosuppressive effects, indirectly, by differentiating the monocytes into M2-like TAMs.Activation status of M1/M2 macrophages in tumour tissues is transient, which gives them a functional plasticity. Our results suggest that CAFs may re-direct M1 macrophages to M2-like macrophages in the tumour tissue. The differentiation of macrophages from anti-tumoural M1-like to pro-tumoural M2-like macrophages is a crucial event in the establishment of the tumour microenvironment. Thus, investigating the factors that drive the trans-differentiation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in tumour tissues has great importance in terms of targeted therapies. We observed that CAF-educated M1 macrophages showed increased secretion of IL-10 and decreased secretion of IL-12 in addition to phenotypic changes (i.e. increased expression of M2 markers). Even though our results demonstrated that CAF-educated M1 macrophages seem to display increased expressions of both CD163 and CD206, the increase in the expression of CD206 did not reach statistical significance (Fig.\u00a07B). Given our results showing that CAF-educated monocytes show significantly increased expressions of both CD163 and CD206 (Fig.\u00a03B), CD206 expression change of CAF-educated M1 macrophages seems interesting. In fact, our studies with human breast cancer tissue samples also demonstrated that higher number of CAFs is correlated with higher numbers of not only CD163+ but also CD206+ macrophages (Table\u00a02). CD206 was reported to be more associated with M2a-like macrophages, while CD163 is prominent on the surface of M2c-like macrophages. In addition, Mantovani et al. reported that M2a macrophages are associated with TH2 type immune responses and elimination of parasites, while M2c macrophages are more implicated in immunoregulation and tissue remodelling. Therefore, CAFs may be inclined to polarize the M1 macrophages more into the M2c phenotype that is associated with immune suppression than M2a. Such a predilection seems reasonable considering tumours are known as wounds that do not heal and thus require a chronic wound healing/tissue remodelling process instead of an allergic response or killing of parasites. This might explain our results about CAF-educated M1 macrophages and our findings suggest that CAFs may be influencing M1/M2 trans-differentiation. It has been shown that IL-4, which is secreted from tumour cells and T lymphocytes, as well as colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which are secreted from tumour cells, take part in pro-tumoural differentiation of macrophages. In line with these studies, we suggest that CAFs may also prove to be important players in this re-polarization process.Since the number of \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts was found to be significantly higher in the tumour stroma compared with that in benign breast tissue and the number of TAMs was higher in tumour stroma than in tumour nest, we analysed the tumour stroma to evaluate both of these cells rather than the tumour nest. We found that the number of CD163+ TAMs significantly correlated with high tumour grade, high Ki-67 proliferation index and high tumour size. In line with such findings, CAF-educated monocytes were found to increase breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro (Fig.\u00a09). The infiltration of CD163+ TAMs seemed to be the highest in triple negative, and the lowest in ER+PR+ breast cancer samples (Fig.\u00a08), although such findings were not statistically significant.The copresence of CAFs and TAMs inside a tumour was considered to be a potential prognostic feature in colorectal cancer patients. In the current study, we showed that there exists a significant correlation between the number of TAMs and the CAF grade in breast cancer. It was recently reported that CAF-derived Chitinase 3-like 1, which is implicated in inflammatory disorders, contributed to tumour growth in breast cancer and this contribution is accompanied by a high infiltration of M2-polarized macrophages and TH2 type immune responses. Therefore, our finding of increased infiltration of breast tumour tissues with TAMs might be a direct result of the presence of high number of CAFs in those tumours; since we also demonstrated that CAFs recruit monocytes and induce M2 type polarization.In this study, we examined the relationship between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and monocytes/macrophages in breast cancer using human ex vivo cellular systems and tissues samples obtained from breast cancer patients as well as in vitro cell lines. Even though our studies were not performed using in vivo systems, our results demonstrate that CAFs promote monocyte migration and enhance their differentiation to M2-like macrophages; based on phenotype, cytokine and functional features. In addition, our studies with human breast cancer patient tissue microarrays (TMAs) showed some translational promise. Future in vivo experiments will shed further light on such new mechanistic insights and provide broader implications, as such systems would simulate all the elements of the tumour microenvironment, as well as demonstrating the effects of cell-to-cell contact in addition to the cross-talk mediated via soluble factors demonstrated in our study. Accordingly, in vivo experiments in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice can be used to prove that human monocytes co-injected s.c. with tumour cells acquire a stronger protumoural effect if preconditioned with CAFs in contrast to NFs.Materials and MethodsIsolation of fibroblasts from normal and cancerous breast tissueNormal breast tissues were obtained from 3 patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty and breast cancer tissues were obtained from 4 patients undergoing therapeutic mastectomy. All fibroblasts were isolated using a previously described protocol that utilizes Collagenase I (1\u2009mg/mL) and Hyaluronidase (125 U/mL) enzymes followed by differential sedimentation and plating. Enzymatically digested tissues were then cultured in high serum media conditions which select for fibroblast growth (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium [DMEM] supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum at 37\u2009C, 5% CO2). All human breast tissues for all of the experiments were obtained in accordance with the laws and institutional guidelines, as approved by the institutional review board of Hacettepe University (Approval numbers: GO 16/64 - 20 and GO 17/380 - 31). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.Characterization of fibroblasts with immunocytochemistryCharacterizations of fibroblasts were performed by immunocytochemistry stainings with vimentin, pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-SMA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells (7\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/300\u2009\u00b5L in each well) were cultured in eight well chamber slides and immunocytochemical / morphological analyses were performed when the cells reached a surface confluency of >80%. A biotin/streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase detection system was utilized and binding of the antibody was demonstrated with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. The images were captured by Olympus BX50 microscope.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM)CMs were obtained from CAFs, NFs and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. When the aforementioned cells reached to a confluency of >80%, they were serum starved. After 48\u2009h, CMs were collected from cell supernatants and clarified by centrifugation.Isolation and culture of peripheral CD14+ monocytesPBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers\u2019 peripheral blood using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077. Separation of CD14+ monocytes from PBMCs was accomplished by using a magnetic bead based positive selection protocol with a purity of >95%. CD14+ monocytes were cultured alone as control monocytes or with CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (CM:RPMI, 1:1) for 7-days.Phenotypical analyses with flow cytometryCD14+ PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured with CMs from NFs, CAFs, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as well as in standard medium for 7 days, then analysed using flow cytometry. M1 macrophages were cultured with CMs from CAFs or MDA-MB-231 cells for 48\u2009hours, then analysed by flow cytometry.Cultured monocytes or macrophages were detached using Accutase cell detachment solution, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were stained with antibodies against CD206, CD163, HLA-DR, CD14, and PD-1. All antibodies were conjugated to Phycoerythrin (PE) or Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Respective isotype-matched antibody controls were used as negative controls.Isolation of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cellsPBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers\u2019 peripheral blood using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077. Separation of CD4+ T-cells from PBMCs was accomplished by using a magnetic bead based negative selection protocol with a purity of >95%. CD4+ T-cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 2.1 mM L-glutamine, 100\u2009U/mL penicillin and 100\u2009mg/mL streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2.CFSE proliferation assaysIn order to assess the effects of CAF-, NF- and MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes on CD4+ T lymphocytes, we performed functional analyses with flow cytometry. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelled CD4+ T-cells were activated by CD3/CD28 magnetic beads (except the negative control group). Activated T-cells were cultured with either control monocytes or with monocytes that had been cultured with CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 cells for 7 days. After 96\u2009hours, proliferation of CFSE labelled CD4+ T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry.Evaluation of cell migrationIn order to evaluate the effects of CAFs, NFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells on monocyte recruitment, we performed in vitro migration assays. Monocyte cells were seeded into the upper compartment in serum-free medium (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 200\u2009\u00b5l). The 5\u2009\u00b5m Transwell chambers were placed into 24-well culture wells containing CMs from CAFs, NFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells. After 5\u2009h incubation, non-migrated cells were removed by cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted in five different fields of polycarbonate filter under a microscope (magnification x100).Evaluation of EMT-related protein expressions by Western BlotMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured for 24\u2009hours prior to CM treatments. The cells were then treated with CMs from NF-, CAF-, MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes or from control monocytes for 48\u2009hours. At the end of this period, cells were lysed in RIPA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). E-cadherin (primary antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; #3195) and vimentin (primary antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 5741) protein expressions in samples were examined by the Western blot method. GAPDH (primay antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, #5174) was used as the Western blot loading control. The membranes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL) and densitometry analyses of the protein bands were performed.Evaluation of EMT-related gene expressions by quantitative real-time PCRMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured for 24\u2009hours prior to CM treatments. The cells were then treated with CMs from NF-, CAF-, MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes or from control monocytes for 48\u2009hours. At the end of this period, RNA isolation from the cells was performed according to the Zymo Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit protocol. Complementary DNA was synthesized with Thermo Scientific RevertAid First Strand cDNA Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time qPCR was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The qPCR data were analysed using the Livak model (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct). Snail (Snail_reverse 5\u2032-CTGCTGGAAGGTAAACTCTGGA-3\u2032, Snail_forward 5\u2032-CGAGTGGTTCTTCTGCGCTA-3\u2032), Slug (Slug_reverse 5\u2032-TTCTCCCCCGTGTGAGTTCTAA-3\u2032, Slug_forward 5\u2032-CACTGCGATGCCCAGTCTA-3\u2032), and Twist (Twist_reverse 5\u2032-CCCACGCCCTGTTTCTTTGA-3\u2032, Twist_forward 5\u2032-GCCGGAGACCTAGATGTCATT-3\u2032) gene expressions were evaluated. \u03b2 -actin was used as the reference gene.Evaluation of cell invasionMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion was evaluated by using Transwell inserts in vitro. Monocytes were differentiated for 7 days using CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009h and corresponding supernatants were then collected. MDA-MB-231 cells in serum-free medium were seeded into upper compartments of Transwell inserts which were pre-coated with Matrigel (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 200\u2009\u00b5l). The lower compartment contained the aforementioned supernatants, which were obtained from monocytes. After 24\u2009hours, non-migrated cells were removed by cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted in five different fields of polycarbonate filter under a microscope (magnification x200).Induction of M1/M2 polarization of macrophagesCD14+ monocytes were cultured in medium containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (50\u2009ng/ml) for 7 days to obtain M0 macrophages. In order to acquire M1 macrophages, M0 macrophages were further cultured in medium containing interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) (100\u2009ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (10\u2009ng/ml) for 2 more days. On the other hand, M0 macrophages were further cultured in medium containing IL-4 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 2 more days in order to obtain M2 macrophages.Assessment of soluble factors by ELISAIn order to evaluate the levels of IL-12 and IL-10 cytokines in the culture supernatants of M1 and M2 macrophages, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We cultured M1 or M2 macrophages alone (as negative control) or with CMs from CAFs, or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells for 2 days. After this period, the cells were further cultured for additional 2 days in serum-free medium. Culture supernatants were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until the assays were performed.Measurement of cell proliferation by MTT assayMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation was evaluated via MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After about a day of incubation, CMs obtained from CAF- or NF-educated-monocytes were added to the wells and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferations were analysed after an additional 48\u2009hours (72\u2009hours in total) by adding 25\u2009\u03bcl MTT reagent (final concentration: 1\u2009mg/ml) in each well. 4\u2009hours after adding the MTT reagent, the precipitate was solubilized by 80\u2009\u03bcl detergent reagent. The plates were then left overnight in the dark and the absorbances were recorded at 570\u2009nm.Real-time and label-free analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with the xCELLigence systemIn order to assess the real-time effects of CAF- and NF-educated monocytes on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation, we performed functional analyses with the RTCA xCELLigence System (ACEA, San Diego, CA, USA). This system utilizes gold biosensor microelectrodes to measure electrical impedance. The background impedance of the microelectrodes were first measured with cell culture medium. Then, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were added to each well of the E-plate. After about a day of incubation, CMs obtained from CAF- or NF-educated-monocytes were added to the wells and the cell indices were measured by electrical impedance over an additional period of 48\u2009hours (72\u2009hours in total).Tissue samples and immunohistochemical stainingsA total of 50 human invasive breast cancer tissue samples were investigated. Patients who had received preoperative/adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. Clinical and pathological variables including age, tumour grade and size, lymph node involvement, Ki-67 staining as well as ER, PR and HER2 status were evaluated.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples were used for tissue microarrays (TMAs). Blocks were made utilizing a 4.0\u2009mm tissue cylinder through a histologically representative area of each donor tumour block. From each donor block, 1\u20132 cores were cut and 8 TMA blocks were prepared. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD163 (Biocare, Clone 10D6, 10\u2009min EDTA, 1:100), CD206 (Abcam, ab64693, 20\u2009min EDTA, 1:200) and \u03b1-SMA (Neomarkers, Clone 1A4, 1:1000) as well as Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) were performed on the 4-\u03bcm thick sections taken from the tissue microarrays using Leica Bond Max III Autostainer, following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Concentrations and antigen retrieval methods were optimized for each antibody using appropriate positive and negative controls.TAM and CAF grade evaluationsAll tissue microarray slides stained with anti-CD163 or anti-CD206 were analysed to identify areas with the highest levels of TAM infiltration. For each case, three hot spots in the tumour stroma (40x objective) were selected for counting TAMs. The median values of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophage numbers in stroma within the areas were used to categorize the patients into high and low grade groups. The intensity of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA positive spindle-shaped fibroblasts) was classified into 2 grades, using a modification of a method previously described: negative to scanty (low grade) or abundant (high grade) in a blinded analysis performed by 2 of the authors (K.K., and B.G.Y.).Statistical analysesThe Mann-Whitney U test, Student\u2019s t-test, chi-squared test, and Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to examine differences in continuous and categorical variables. A 5% type-I error level was used to infer statistical significance. All statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Software version 23.ConclusionsOur results propose that CAFs recruit monocytes and induce TAMs which might be suppressing the immune system via the PD-1 axis. We herein demonstrated that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration in order to increase the effectiveness of conventional therapies as well as immunotherapies against breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Betul Gok Yavuz and Gurcan Gunaydin contributed equally.Electronic supplementary materialSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1038/s41598-019-39553-z.Author ContributionsB.G.Y., G.G., M.E.G. and K.K. performed the experiments.

Clinically, BC has different histological forms, which may lead to different treatment regimens and prognosis. Although early diagnosis and treatment strategies, such as endocrine agents, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and biological targeting agents, have been improved in recent decades, the prognosis of BC remains poor, especially of patients with recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, establishing molecular biomarkers that can detect early metastasis of BC is necessary for BC patients.It has been shown that the interaction between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer. The interactions between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment are mediated through direct or indirect mechanisms, which involve in deposited substances, stromal cells, or secretion of proteins. The activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to be the most enriched cells in tumor stroma and promote tumor growth and metastasis by secreting a variety of soluble factors, directly interacting with tumor cells, regulating immune-response, and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Studies comparing co-culture of BC cells with or without fibroblasts showed increased proliferation, anti-apoptosis, metastasis, metabolism, and chemoresistance when they were co-cultured. Interestingly, not only CAFs within tumor but also CAFs immediately adjacent to tumor promoted cancer progression.Chemokines are a family of cytokines or signaling proteins exerting their biological effects by interacting with G-protein-coupled receptors, initiating an intracellular signal cascade that facilitates migration to chemokine source. There are increasing evidences that chemokines and chemokine receptors directly affect the survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and metastasis of many cancer cells, including BC cells, which express chemokine receptors and respond to specific chemokines. C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is an important chemokine receptor for BC progression that is expressed in BC and correlated with a poor survival outcome of BC patients. The ability of CAFs to influence tumor growth was partly dependent on their ability to induce angiogenesis by CAF derived C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), a ligand of CCR4. C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) is another ligand of CCR4 that is highly expressed by thymus and other cells such as fibroblasts, and CCL17/CCR4 signaling promotes lung metastasis of BC. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the CCL17/CCR4 signaling mediated by CAFs in BC progression remain elusive.The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, including the well-known mediator extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), regulates matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) expression. MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play a role in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and immune-response and affect bioactive molecules on the cell surface, suggesting that they play important roles inside and outside of ECM degradation. MMP13 is known to promote BC cell invasion and metastasis and is associated with overall survival of BC patients. ERK1/2, as well as its downstream signaling effector MMP13, is some of the mechanism by which CXCL12/CXCR4 or CCL17/CCR4 regulates cell invasion and migration of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and bladder cancer. However, how CCL17 regulates ERK1/2 pathway directly or indirectly remains unclear. MAP kinase phosphatase enzymes (MKPs) belong to the family of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), inactivating different MAPK proteins, including ERK1/2. Among these, DUSP6 displays a high specificity for ERK1/2 and has been found to regulate BC cell migration and invasion.Hence, the correlation of clinicopathological characteristics with CCL17 expression, the functional effect of CAFs on BC progression, and the potential mechanisms by which CCL17 promotes tumor were clarified. In the present study, we found that CCL17 expression is increased in BC tissues and CAFs and associates with lymph nodes, TNM stage, and tumor size of BC patients. CCL17 produced by CAFs promotes migration and invasion of BC cells through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Therefore, our findings emphasize an important role for CCL17 in controlling BC development, which is helpful to identify potential therapeutic targets for its treatment.Materials and methodsTissue samples and isolation of primary fibroblastsHuman BC tissues and the corresponding adjacent-normal breast tissues as well as peripheral blood samples were obtained from 140 BC patients who underwent surgery at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between 2016 and 2018. These adjacent-normal breast tissues were resected within at least 5 cm of the tumor margin when the patients underwent definitive surgery. The healthy control groups included 140 healthy women who underwent mammary gland examination prior to peripheral blood sample collection. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described previously. Briefly, tumor and adjacent-normal tissues were digested with 2% collagenase II (1 mg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 30 mins at 37\u00b0C, then cultured in DMEM containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37\u00b0C in an incubator, and the fibroblasts derived from tumor and adjacent-normal tissues were defined as CAFs and NFs, respectively. The medium was changed every 2 days. In the present study, low-passage-number primary fibroblasts (<4) were used and characterized by strong immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and negative immunohistochemical staining for CK19 (Figure S1), using anti-CK19 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; ab52625) or anti-vimentin antibody (Abcam; ab8978).Ethical approvalAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration. This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital. Written informed consents were provided prior to enrollment of patients.Cell cultureHuman BC cell lines MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation, Rochester, MI, USA) and MDA-MB-231 (EG&G Mason Research Institute, Worcester, MA, USA) were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified air atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Solarbio).Transfection and lentivirus infectionThe RNAi (RNA interference) sequences targeting position 227\u2013245 (shRNA-1; 5\u02b9-GCTGCCTGGAGTACTTCAA-3\u02b9), position 366\u2013384 (shRNA-2; 5\u02b9-GCTGCCTGGAGTACTTCAA-3\u02b9) or position 379\u2013397 (shRNA-3; 5\u02b9-GCAGTTAAATACCTGCAAA-3\u02b9) of the human CCL17 gene were cloned into the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA). For lentiviral production, HEK-293T cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of the lentiviral vectors for 4 hrs. After incubation for 48 hrs, viral particles in cell culture medium were collected and infected CAFs. CCL17 or DUSP6 overexpression was constructed by cloning full-length human CCL17 or DUSP6 into the pLVX-Puro lentiviral expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and then transfected into 293T cells as above described and used to infect NFs or MCF-7 cells. Cells transduced with pLKO.1-scramble shRNA (shNC) or blank pLVX-Puro (Vector) were used as negative controls.Cafs/nfs and MCF-7/MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultureCAFs with pLKO.1-CCL17-shRNA or shNC infection and NFs with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank vector infection were digested with trypsin and resuspended in DMEM with the cell density of 5\u00d7104/mL. 0.1 mL cell suspension (5\u00d7103 cells per well) in each group was added into the upper well of the transwell inserts containing polycarbonate filters with 3-\u03bcm pores (Corning, Madrid, Spain). The lower chamber was inoculated with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells at a density of 5\u00d7103 cells per well and cultured in the incubator of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. After co-culture for 48 hrs, the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were collected for the following experiments.Cell proliferationCells (3\u00d7103/well) were seeded into 96-well plate and maintained overnight prior to conduction of experiments. After 12, 24, and 48 hrs, cells were incubated with 10% Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) solution (SAB Biotech., College Park, MD, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Optical density at wavelength 450 nm (OD450) was determined using a microplate reader.Transwell assayCells (3\u00d7105/well) were seeded onto 24-well plates and maintained overnight prior to conduction of experiments. After treatment, cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs, following which 3\u00d7105 cells/well in 300 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM were placed in the upper chamber at 37\u00b0C. The DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (700 \u03bcL) was added into the lower chamber. After 24 hrs incubation, the cell invasion and migration were determined in Transwell inserts (Millipore) containing polycarbonate filters with 8 \u03bcm pores coated with or without Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) as detailed previously.RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCRRNA was extracted from BC cell lines or tissues using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and reverse transcription reaction on RNA was carried out using PrimeScript reagent kit (Takara Biomedical Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Real-time Quantitative PCR for CCL17, CCR4, and DUSP6 was performed using an ABI Prism 7,500 sequence detection PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Shanghai, China).

Gene expression was determined by normalizing to GAPDH and calculating by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)CCL17 content in peripheral blood or fibroblast supernatants was measured by Human TARC ELISA Kit (CCL17) (Abcam; ab183366) and MMP13 content in BC cell supernatants was measured by MMP13 Human ELISA Kit (Abcam; ab100605), following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction.Western blotWestern blotting was conducted as previously described. Proteins were analyzed with the following antibodies: anti-CCL17 (Abcam; ab182793; 1:300), anti-CCR4 (Abcam; ab83250; 1:1,000, anti-DUSP6 (Abcam; ab181088; 1:1,000), anti-MMP13 (Abcam; ab84594; 1:1,000), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 9102; 1:1000), anti-p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology; 9,101; 1:1,000), anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology; 5,174; 1:2,000) and the secondary antibodies (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China; A0208; 1:1000).Statistical analysesAll experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times. The results represent the mean \u00b1 SD where applicable. The numerical data were statistically analyzed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA). Differences between the groups were determined with one-way ANOVA analyses followed by Dunnett\u2019s test, two-way ANOVA analyses followed by Tukey post-test or Student\u2019s t-test when only two groups were compared. Correlations between CCL17 and DUSP6 expression levels in BC tissues were assessed by Pearson correlation.

CCL17 expression was increased in tumor BC tissues compared with corresponding adjacent-normal tissues as well as in peripheral blood from BC patients compared with healthy controls (Figure 1A and B). Moreover, CAFs in the microenvironment are essential for tumor progression in BC. To know the role of CCL17 in CAFs, CCL17 expression is also measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1C and D, CCL17 expression was also increased in CAFs compared with NFs.Correlation of CCL17 expression with clinicopathological features of BCClinicopathological parameter\tCCL17 expression\tP-value\t \tHigh (n=98)\tLow (n=42)\t \tAge (years)\u2003<57\u2003\u226557\t5543\t2814\t0.2445\t \tTumor size (cm)\u2003<3\u2003\u22653\t5147\t3012\t0.0333\t \tTNM stage\u2003I/II\u2003III/IV\t6137\t348\t0.0299\t \tLymph nodes\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t6236\t1329\t0.0004\t \tHistologic grade\u2003I\u2003II\u2003III\t293138\t111219\t0.7158\t \tHistological type\u2003Ductal\u2003Non-ductal\t5840\t1824\t0.0756\t \tER status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t4850\t2220\t0.7122\t \tPR status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t5543\t2913\t0.1526\t \tHER2 status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t5741\t2715\t0.4980\t \tNote: Differences between groups were done by the Chi-square test.Abbreviations: BC, breast cancer; ER, estrogen receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor type 2. To further analyze the correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and CCL17 expression, the 140 BC patients were divided into two groups according to the mRNA level of CCL17 measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR comprising a CCL17 high expression group with fold change >1.5 (n=98, 70%) and CCL17 low expression group with fold change <1.5 (n=42, 30%) (Table 1). The age, histologic grade, histological type, ER status, PR status, and HER2 status of the patients were not significantly associated with the expression of CCL17. A statistically significant association of CCL17 was observed with tumor size, TNM stage, and lymph nodes. These data suggest that high CCL17 expression is closely correlated with tumor progression in BC patients. CCL17 regulates CCR4 expression and the proliferation of fibroblastsCCL17 expression regulated the proliferation of fibroblasts. CAFs were transduced with pLKO.1-CCL17 shRNA or shNC, and NFs were transduced with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank pLVX-Puro (vector). (A, C) CCL17 content was measured by ELISA; (B, D) CCR4 expression was measured by Western blot; and (E, F) cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; NFs, normal fibroblasts; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To investigate the pivotal role of CCL17/CCR4 signaling in fibroblasts, CCL17 was knockdown and overexpression in CAFs and NFs, respectively, and CCL17 and CCR4 expression level in cell lysate and cell supernatant was measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR, Western blot and ELISA analysis. As shown in Figure S2A and B, CCL17 shRNA-1, shRNA-2, and shRNA-3 significantly decreased the mRNA levels of CCL17 by 74.6%, 81.6%, and 65.6% and the protein levels of CCL17 by 75.3%, 70.7%, and 66.4% in CAFs compared with shNC, respectively. CCL17 overexpression significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of CCL17 by 4.3-fold and 3.9-fold in NFs compared with blank vector, respectively (Figure S2C and D). Meanwhile, CCL17 shRNA-1 and shRNA-2 also significantly decreased the CCL17 release and CCR4 expression in CAFs (Figure 2A and B), while CCL17 overexpression markedly increased the CCL17 release and CCR4 expression in NFs (Figure 2C and D). Moreover, our data showed that CCL17 knockdown markedly decreased the cell proliferation of CAFs by approximately 17% at 48 hrs, while CCL17 overexpression markedly increased the cell proliferation of NFs by 15.6% at 48 hrs (Figure 2E and F). These data suggest that CCL17/CCR4 signaling involves in the proliferation of fibroblasts.CCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibits BC cell invasion and migrationCCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibited BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs. (A, B) Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8, and (C\u2013E) invasion and migration were measured by Transwell assay. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer. To explore the important role of CAFs in invasion and migration of BC cells, MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CAFs with CCL17 knockdown, and the CCK-8 and Transwell assay were performed. As shown in Figure 3A and B, CAFs could increase the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells by 19.8% and 21.7% at 48 hrs, which were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs. Moreover, CAFs also increased the migration and invasion of MCF-7 by 2.04-fold and 2.0-fold and that of MDA-MB-231 cells by 2.78-fold and 3.02-fold, which were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs (Figure 3C\u2013E).CCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibited CCL17, CCR4, MMP13, and p-ERK1/2 but promoted DUSP6 expression in BC cell lines. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, and the expression of (A, B) CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, (A, C) p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting. MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, and the expression of (E, F) CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, (E, G) p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs. (D, H) The MMP13 concentration was measured by ELISA. *P<0.05, \u00a0**P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer.To further determine the importance of CCL17/CCR4 signaling in BC cell invasion and migration, the expression of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, DUSP6, and MMP13 was measured by Western blotting. We found that CAFs not only induced the expression of CCL17 and CCR4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, but also increased the expression of MMP13 and p-ERK1/2 and decreased the DUSP6 expression. However, these CAFs-mediated protein expressions were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs (Figure 4A\u2013H). These data suggested that CAFs with CCL17 knockdown suppressed BC cell migration and invasion.CCL17 overexpression in NFs promotes BC cell invasion and migrationCCL17 overexpression in NFs promotes BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 overexpression-induced NFs. (A) Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8; (B, C) migration and invasion were measured by Transwell; (D\u2013F) expression of CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting; and (G) MMP13 concentration was measured by ELISA. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: NFs, normal fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We further examined the effect of NFs with CCL17 overexpression on BC cell migration and invasion. We found that co-culture with NFs increased MCF-7 cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and the expression of CCL17, CCR4, MMP13, and p-ERK1/2 and decreased the DUSP6 expression, which was significantly enhanced by CCL17 overexpression in NFs (Figure 5A\u2013G).DUSP6 overexpression inhibited BC cell invasion and migrationDUSP6 overexpression inhibited BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. (A\u2013C) MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of recombinant CCL17 protein (rCCL17; 50, 100, and 200 ng/mL), and the expression of CCR4 and DUSP6 was measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR and Western blot. MCF-7 cells were transduced with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank pLVX-Puro (vector) in the presence or absence of recombinant CCL17 (100 ng/mL). (D, E) Cell migration and invasion were measured by Transwell; (F) expression of MMP13, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Transwell, Western blot; and (G) MMP13 concentration was measured by ELISA. ***P<0.001.Abbreviation: ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.To further examine the function of CCL17 in BC cell invasion and migration, MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of recombinant CCL17 protein (50, 100, and 200 ng/mL), and the expression of CCR4 and DUSP6 was measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR and Western blot. It was found that recombinant CCL17 protein significantly increased the CCR4 expression and decreased the DUSP6 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A\u2013C). These results suggest that DUSP6 may involve in CCL17-mediated BC progression. To confirm our hypothesis, MCF-7 cells with DUSP6 overexpression were treated with recombinant CCL17 protein (100 ng/mL), and the cell invasion, migration, and the expression of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and MMP13 were measured. The results showed that DUSP6 overexpression inhibited recombinant CCL17 protein-induced cell migration, invasion, and the expression of MMP13 and p-ERK1/2 in MCF-7 cells (Figure 6D\u2013G). Previous study demonstrated that DUSP6 is a key ERK-specific phosphatase that induces dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, negatively regulating the ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, it suggests that ERK1/2 signaling may associate with CCL17-induced BC cell migration and invasion.Correlation analyses in BC tissuesCorrelation analysis between DUSP6 and CCL17 in BC tissues. (A) DUSP6 mRNA levels in BC tissues (n=140) and corresponding adjacent-normal tissues (n=140) were measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR. (B) Pearson correlation scatter plots in BC tissues (n=140). ***P<0.001.Abbreviation: BC, breast cancer. We next investigate DUSP6 expression by Real-time Quantitative PCR in tumor tissues from BC patients. DUSP6 expression was decreased in tumor tissues compared with their corresponding adjacent-normal controls (Figure 7A). Pearson correlation analysis showed that DUSP6 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with the mRNA expression of CCL17 in BC tissues (Figure 7B). These data further supported the findings in BC cell lines.DiscussionThere are reports shown that development of cancer is not only dependent on tumor cells, but also co-mediated by the tumor microenvironment. CAFs, the most common stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, significantly contribute to tumor initiation, proliferation, invasion, migration, metastasis, and drug resistance in various types of cancers, including BC. It has been well established that chemokines and their receptors are participated in the cross-talk of fibroblasts and cancer cells. Here, we focused on the function of CAF-associated CCL17 in cell invasion and migration of BC via a clinical exploration and in vitro investigation. In this study, we showed that CCL17 levels were significantly up-regulated in BC tissues, peripheral blood, and CAFs compared with their corresponding controls, respectively. CCL17 expression was correlated with lymph nodes, TNM stage and tumor size of BC patients. CAFs or NFs-derived CCL17 may promote BC cell invasion and migration through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway.It is worth noting that the CCL17 plays an important role in promoting cancer progression. In fact, our clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that high CCL17 expression was correlated with advanced TNM stage, larger tumor size and increased lymph node metastasis, indicating that CCL17 is associated with the aggressiveness of BC. Consistent with our findings, CCL17 expression was found increased in BC tissues in comparison to normal tissues. CCL17 recruits CCR4 positive regulatory T cells and promotes lung metastasis of BC. Moreover, CCR4 positively correlates with lymph node metastasis in BC patients, supporting our result of higher expression of CCL17 in BC patients with positive lymph nodes. However, CCL17 mRNA expression was correlated with races and HER2 status, but age and stage were not found to be correlated with CCL17 expression in BC. Weide et al, reported that serum CCL17 level was lower in melanoma patients compared with healthy controls. Similar finding in our study was that of a statistically significant increase of CCL17 content in peripheral blood in BC patients compared with healthy controls, and CCL17 may therefore as differentiation maker between BC and healthy women.Many groups have identified that CAFs significantly contributed to cancer progression. For example, CAFs-derived interleukin 32 (IL32) promotes BC cell invasion and metastasis via integrin \u03b23-p38 MAPK signaling. CAFs promoted hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, and CXCL16 through hedgehog and TGF-\u03b2 pathways. CAFs promoted integrin \u03b21 clustering and invasiveness in gastric cancer through activating CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Our study showed that CAFs-induced BC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and CCR4 expression were significantly reversed by CCL17 down-regulation in CAFs, while the tumor-promoting effects of NFs on BC were markedly strengthened by CCL17 up-regulation in NFs. Since CCL17 activates ERK1/2 signaling and CCR4 acts as a downstream target of ERK1/2/NF-\u03baB pathway, we indicate that CCL17 positively regulates CCR4 protein levels through activating ERK1/2 signaling. CCL17/CCR4 signaling is of great importance in CAFs/NFs-induced BC metastasis. In line with our findings, CCL17 originating from CXCL14-activated fibroblasts that display phenotypes similar to CAFs can markedly increase migration and invasion abilities of BC cells and is potentially associated with EMT, which is markedly inhibited by CCR4 down-regulation. Moreover, CCR4 enhances the chemotactic response of BC cells to CCL17, promotes BC cell growth and metastasis in vivo, but has no effect on BC cell proliferation in vitro. It is acknowledged that normal fibroblasts are often considered to be tumor suppressive. Meanwhile, NFs also have no effect on regulating cancer cells in the co-culture system. Therefore, the role of NFs in tumorigenesis needs to be further investigated.Previous study also showed that CXCL14 secreted by BC cells activated mammary fibroblasts through the ERK1/2 pathway, and activated CAFs promoted the cell migration and metastasis of BC through the CCL17/CCR4 axis. In the present study, CAFs or NFs-induced ERK1/2 activation and its downstream signaling effector MMP13 in BC cells were inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs and strengthened by CCL17 overexpression in NFs, respectively. DUSP6 is an effective phosphatase that reverses ERK1/2 phosphorylation and is therefore a negative regulator of MAPK activity, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role of DUSP6 via pivotal negative feedback regulation of the ERK1/2 in diverse cancers. Treatment of BC cells with recombinant CCL17 significantly increased CCR4 while decreased DUSP6 expression in a dose-dependent manner. DUSP6 overexpression markedly inhibited cell invasion, migration, MMP13 expression and the ERK1/2 activation in MCF-7 cells with recombinant CCL17. These findings suggest DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway may involve in BC invasion and migration induced by CAFs-derived CCL17. MMP13 is known to promote BC cell invasion and metastasis and be associated with overall survival of BC patients. Stimulation of regulatory T cells with CCL17/CCR4 can phosphorylate ERK1/2, and CCR4 up-regulates MMP13 expression through ERK1/2 in colorectal cancer. Similarly, Zhao et al, also reported that CCL17/CCR4 axis can induce the metastasis of bladder cancer cells by promoting ERK1/2 signaling and MMP13 expression. CXCL12/CXCR4 promoted laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis through MMP-13-dependent invasion via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Since DUSP6 undergoes highly specific interaction with ERK1/2, which leads to the DUSP6 inactivation, we suggest that CCL17 may regulate the DUSP6 levels through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, contrary to a tumor-suppressive role of DUSP6 in cancers, DUSP6 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated decreased cell migration and invasion. Therefore, DUSP6 may play its functions depending on the histological subtypes of the cells.ConclusionIn conclusion, our study elucidated that regulation of CCL17 expression in CAFs promoted cell invasion and migration of BC through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway. These findings suggest that CAFs-derived CCL17 could be potential therapeutic targets for BC metastasis, although the further mechanistic study is warranted.Supplementary materialsDisclosureThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.ReferencesMFG-E8 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patientsPlasma chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 concentrations as diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer patientsAndrogen receptor in triple negative breast cancer: a potential target for the targetless subtypeThe chemokine receptor CCR4 promotes tumor growth and lung metastasis in breast cancerBioinformatics analysis revealing prognostic significance of RRM2 gene in breast cancerKRT19 and CEACAM5 mRNA-marked circulated tumor cells indicate unfavorable prognosis of breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin beta3-p38 MAPK signallingPhenotypic and functional heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast within the tumor microenvironmentTGF-beta receptor type-2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts regulates breast cancer cell growth and survival and is a prognostic marker in pre-menopausal breast cancerDown-regulation of miR-29b in carcinoma associated fibroblasts promotes cell growth and metastasis of breast cancerCancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated in cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and in the peritumoural skinCXCL12/CXCR4 activation by cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes integrin beta1 clustering and invasiveness in gastric cancerThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerCCL17/TARC and CCR4 expression in Merkel cell carcinomaBreast cancer lung metastasis requires expression of chemokine receptor CCR4 and regulatory T cellsAJUBA promotes the migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells through upregulation of MMP10 and MMP13 expressionBiochemical and biological attributes of matrix metalloproteinasesZinc finger protein 143 expression is closely related to tumor malignancy via regulating cell motility in breast cancerCCL17-CCR4 axis promotes metastasis via ERK/MMP13 pathway in bladder cancerCXCL12/CXCR4 promotes laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis through MMP-13-dependent invasion via the ERK1/2/AP-1 pathwayDUSP6/MKP3 is overexpressed in papillary and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and contributes to neoplastic properties of thyroid cancer cellsSilencing of DUSP6 gene by RNAi-mediation inhibits proliferation and growth in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells: an in vitro studyLncRNA expression signatures of twist-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in MCF10A cellsCullin3 promotes breast cancer cells metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting BRMS1 for degradationDeubiquitinase USP47/UBP64E regulates beta-catenin ubiquitination and degradation and plays a positive role in Wnt signalingDual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6): a review of its molecular characteristics and clinical relevance in cancerRecent advances in understanding tumor stroma-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancerCC chemokines are differentially expressed in breast cancer and are associated with disparity in overall survivalIncreased CCL17 serum levels are associated with improved survival in advanced melanomaCancer-associated fibroblasts promote hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through chemokine-activated hedgehog and TGF-beta pathwaysCorrection: CCR4 promotes metastasis via ERK/NF-kappaB/MMP13 pathway and acts downstream of TNF-alpha in colorectal cancerHIC1 deletion promotes breast cancer progression by activating tumor cell/fibroblast crosstalkBiological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their paired normal fibroblasts in human breast cancerTumor suppressor dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) impairs cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated phenotypeDual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) is an ETS-regulated negative feedback mediator of oncogenic ERK signaling in lung cancer cellsSelective deregulation in chemokine signaling pathways of CD4+CD25(hi)CD127(lo)/(-) regulatory T cells in human allergic asthmaThe nuclear factor NF-kappaB pathway in inflammationDUSP6/MKP-3 inactivates ERK1/2 but fails to bind and inactivate ERK5"

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

Basal-like breast cancers comprise up to 15% of all of breast cancer cases diagnosed in the US and Canada. However, patients diagnosed with basal-like breast cancers exhibit the shortest time for overall survival and recurrence free survival. 75% of basal\u2013like breast cancers are triple negative (TNBC); i.e, they lack expression of Her2, progesterone receptor and estrogen receptors. TNBCs are non-responsive to endocrine and targeted Her2 therapies. In order to treat TNBC more effectively, it is necessary to identify new molecular targets tailored to this disease subtype.CCL2 (MCP-1) represents a promising molecular target for therapeutic intervention. CCL2 belongs to a family of small soluble molecules (8kDa) known as chemokines, and bind to G protein coupled receptors to regulate macrophage recruitment during wound healing, inflammation and infection. Chronic overexpression of CCL2 contributes to inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, fibrosis and macular degeneration. Overexpression of CCL2 in the tumor epithelium correlates with tumor grade and poor patient prognosis in various tumor types including: gliomas, prostate cancers, ovarian cancers and breast cancers. In primary prostate and mammary tumors, CCL2 overexpression correlates with recruitment of M2 polarized macrophages, a subpopulation of macrophages that facilitate tumor progression through secretion of growth and survival factors. In functional studies, CCL2 antibody neutralization in 4T1 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, while decreasing the levels of macrophages in the primary tumors, indicating that CCL2 promotes progression of TNBC through macrophage dependent mechanisms. Recent studies demonstrate that CCL2 also signal to breast cancer cells to regulate survival and invasion. These studies indicate that CCL2 regulates multiple mechanisms of breast cancer progression, demonstrating potential value as a therapeutic target.Currently, the value of CCL2 as a therapeutic target is controversial. CCL2 neutralizing antibodies effectively blocked rheumatoid arthritis in mouse models, yet failed in clinical trials. Patients treated with CCL2 neutralizing antibodies showed accumulating levels of protein. In breast tumor bearing mice, continuous treatment with CCL2 neutralizing antibodies inhibited mammary tumor progression. However, termination of treatment led to increased metastasis, which was associated with increased tumor angiogenesis. These studies indicate that either CCL2 is not an effective therapeutic target or that neutralizing antibodies are a suboptimal method for blocking CCL2 activity. To more clearly evaluate these possibilities, we developed a novel approach to target CCL2 through gene silencing.Gene silencing through small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) could selectively inactivate expression and activity of critical oncogenes, but would require a carrier to efficiently and specifically penetrate tumor cells and tissues. The HIV-1 derived trans-activating transcriptor peptide (TAT49-57: RKKRRQRRR) exhibits unusual properties by efficiently penetrating cell membranes, independent of temperature or cell surface receptor expression but do not stably complex with siRNAs or DNA. Recent discoveries made by our research group showed that calcium ions strengthened the interactions between TAT peptides to siRNA and plasmid DNA, through non-covalent cross-linking. Furthermore, calcium crosslinking of TAT (Ca-TAT) to siRNA or plasmid DNA condensed these complexes to nanoparticles, enhancing cellular transfection and gene knockdown more effectively, and with much lower toxicity than TAT CPPs alone or conventional polyethyleneimine particles.Using Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes, we sought to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting gene expression of CCL2 in TNBC. Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes were observed to efficiently transfect MDA-MB-231 and DCIS.com breast cancer cells plated in 2D and 3D cultures, and reduce CCL2 expression more effectively than CCL2 neutralizing antibodies. In contrast to CCL2 antibody neutralization of breast tumor xenografts, CCL2 gene silencing did not increase tumor cell apoptosis or affect tumor angiogenesis. Instead, CCL2 gene silencing lead to increased tumor cell necrosis and autophagy, associated with a reduction in the number of cancer stem cells and recruitment of M2 macrophages. CCL2 gene silencing but not CCL2 antibody neutralization, significantly reduced CCL2 expression in breast cancer cells over time. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that targeting CCL2 expression exerts therapeutic effects different from blocking CCL2 activity through antibody binding. This study demonstrates a novel approach to target CCL2 and reveals important insight into the effects of CCL2 gene silencing on necrosis, autophagy, cancer stem cell renewal and macrophage recruitment.RESULTSCa-TAT/siRNA particles target carcinoma cells to reduce CCL2 expressionWe first characterized the efficiency of gene silencing from Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes using cell culture models. In previous studies, we demonstrated that CaCl2 concentration and N/P ratio were significant factors affecting transfection efficiency of cultured PyVmT mammary carcinoma cells. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we had determined that N/P=5 and 75 mM CaCl2 transfected mammary carcinoma cells most efficiently. Using this formula, Ca-TAT peptides were complexed to control eGFP siRNA, huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2. According to ELISA analysis of 2D cultures, Ca-TAT delivery of huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2 to either MDA-MB-231 or DCIS.com cells resulted in over a 50% knockdown in CCL2 expression, compared to Ca-TAT peptides complexed to control siRNA (Figure 1A-1B). We next determined the transfection efficiency of Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes in 3D collagen cultures, which closely model the architecture of breast tumor tissues. Ca-TAT delivery of huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2 efficiently transfected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells embedded in collagen and silenced CCL2 expression at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 1C). CCL2 neutralizing antibodies did not significantly affect CCL2 expression in 3D cultures (Figure 1D). In summary, these studies indicate that Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes efficiently knock down CCL2 expression in breast cancer cells.Ca-TAT peptides complexed to CCL2 siRNAs significantly reduce CCL2 protein expression in breast cancer cellsA. MDA-MB-231 or B. DCIS.com cells cultured in 2D were transfected with Ca-TAT peptides complexed to control (Con) or CCL2 siRNAs (huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2). 48 hours post transfection, conditioned media was measured by CCL2 ELISA. Par= Parental. C-D. MDA-MB-231cells were cultured in 3D collagen, and were transfected with Ca-TAT peptides complexed to siRNAs (C) or treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml anti-CCL2 or IgG (D). CCL2 expression was measured in conditioned medium by ELISA, 24 hours and 48 hours post-treatment. Statistical analysis was performed by One way ANOVA followed by Bonferonni post-hoc analysis. Statistical significance was determined by p-value less than 0.05. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, n.s=not significant. Mean+SEM is shown.Inhibition of tumor growth and invasion with CCL2 gene silencingTo recapitulate formation of TNBC with a humanized stroma, MDA-MB-231 cells were co-transplanted with human carcinoma associated fibroblasts in collagen and transplanted in the inguinal mammary glands of nude mice. When tumors grew to approximately 0.5 cm in diameter, the xenografts received injections every three days with Ca-TAT complexed to control siRNA, huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2, for a total of three injections per experimental group. Animals were sacrificed 30 days post-transplantation, when control tumors reached approximately 1.5 cm3 (Figure 2A), the maximum allowable tumor size, as outlined by the institutional animal care and use committee. CCL2 expression levels in tumor tissues or surrounding normal tissues were distinguished through flow cytometry staining with antibodies recognizing murine or human specific CCL2. Tumors receiving injections of Ca-TAT/huCCL2si1 or Ca-TAT/huCCL2si2 showed a significant 45% reduction in cells expressing overall human CCL2 protein compared to tumors receiving injections of control siRNA. Silencing of CCL2 in tumor tissues down-regulated CCL2 protein expression to levels found in normal mammary tissues (Figure 2B). There were no significant differences in murine CCL2 protein expression with Ca-TAT delivery of control siRNA, huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2, indicating that CCL2 expression in normal tissues were not affected by multiple injections of these complexes.Ca-TAT delivery of CCL2 siRNAs inhibits growth and enhances cell death of primary MDA-MB-231 tumor xenograftsA. Experimental plan for treatment of MDA-MB-231 tumor bearing mice with Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes. 21 days post transplantation, tumors received injections every three days with Ca-TAT peptides complexed to 10 micrograms control or CCL2 siRNAs (huCCL2si1, huCCL2si2) for a total of three injections, n=6 per group. Animals were euthanized 30 days post-transplantation for tissue harvest and analysis. B. Tumor and surrounding normal mammary tissues were analyzed for CCL2 expression by flow cytometry C. Representative tumors with quantified tumor mass. D. Representative H&E stain of primary tumor xenografts. Necrotic areas were identified on H&E stains at 5 different depths of the tumor and quantified by Image J analysis. Necrotic areas are outlined. Scale bar= 200 microns. Statistical analysis was performed by One way ANOVA followed by Bonferonni post-hoc comparisons with Control siRNA group. Statistical significance was determined by p-value less than 0.05. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, n.s= not significant. Mean+SEM is shown.We determined the effects of CCL2 gene silencing on primary tumor growth and invasion. Compared to tumors treated with Ca-TAT/control siRNA complexes, tumors treated with Ca-TAT/huCCL2si1 exhibited a significant 40% decrease in mass, while tumors treated with Ca-TAT/huCCL2si2 exhibited a decrease in mass by 46% (Figure 2C). By H&E stain, tumor tissues treated with complexes of Ca-TAT/huCCL2si1 or Ca-TAT/huCCL2si2 showed exhibited extensive necrotic cell death throughout the tumor, as indicated by loss of tumor cell membrane and nuclear integrity (Figure 2D). Tumor tissues were examined for changes in invasion into muscle tissue. By H&E stain and by co-immunofluorescence staining for Calsequestrin and Cytokeratin 5 (CK5), control treated tumors showed extensive invasion into muscle tissue (Figure 3A). Tumors treated with Ca-TAT/huCCL2si1 or Ca-TAT/huCCL2si2 complexes showed a visible decrease in local invasion. In blinded studies, three different individuals scored tumor sections stained by H&E for invasion into muscle tissue. Sections at three different depths of the tumor were scored. By statistical analysis, we observed that tumors treated with Ca-TAT/huCCL2si1 or Ca-TAT/huCCL2si2 has a significant number of lower scores than the control group (Table 1). When we analyzed for changes in metastasis, we observed a significant decrease in the number and size of lung metastases in mice treated with Ca-TAT/huCCL2si1 or Ca-TAT/huCCL2si2 complexes (Figure 3B-3C). These data indicate that Ca-TAT delivery of CCL2 siRNAs inhibits breast tumor growth, invasion and metastasis.CCL2 gene silencing inhibits primary and secondary invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast tumorsA.

The scores for each depth were averaged per sample, resulting in 3 scores per sample, and with n=6 tumor samples per group, this resulted in a total 18 scores per group. Statistical analysis was determined by Chi Square test. Statistical analysis was determined by p<0.05. Analyses by individuals are shown.To further understand the effects of CCL2 silencing on tumor progression, primary breast tumor xenografts were examined for changes in cell proliferation and cell death by immunohistochemistry staining. We observed a significant reduction in PCNA expression from 42.9% with control siRNAs to 21.3% with huCCL2si1 and 21.2% with huCCL2si2. These data indicate decreased tumor cell proliferation (Figure 4A). No changes in cleaved caspase-3 expression were observed in the primary tumors among the experimental groups (Figure 4B). As tumor necrosis was observed by H&E stain, this phenotype was further confirmed by HMGB1 immunostaining. HMGB1 expression was positive in viable tumor cell nuclei. Loss of HMGB1 expression was evident in cells that were absent of hematoxylin staining, indicating loss of intact nuclei. Compared to Ca-TAT/control siRNA treatment, Ca-TAT delivery of either CCL2 siRNAs reduced HMGB1 in the primary tumor by over 75% (Figure 4C), further demonstrating increased necrosis in the primary tumor with CCL2 gene silencing. To identify for possible changes in cellular autophagy, tumors were immunostained for LC3B expression. Compared to Ca-TAT/control siRNA treatment, Ca-TAT delivery of huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2 increased LC3B expression by over 45% (Figure 4D). Taken together, silencing of CCL2 gene expression results in decreased breast tumor cell proliferation, and increased necrosis and autophagy.CCL2 gene silencing enhances necrosis and autophagy in MDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenograftsMDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts were injected with Ca-TAT peptides complexed to control siRNAs (Con), or CCL2 siRNAs (huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2), and immunostained for expression of A. PCNA, B. Cleaved caspase-3, C. HMGB1, or D. LC3B. Scale=100 microns. Statistical analysis was performed by One Way ANOVA followed by Bonferonni post-hoc analysis. Statistical significance was determined by p-value less than 0.05. *p<0.05, ***p<0.001, n.s=not significant. Mean+SEM is shown. N=6 animals per group.Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes inhibits the growth of tumor initiating cellsTumor initiating cells (also referred to as cancer stem cells or CSCs) contribute to breast cancer recurrence and development of metastatic breast cancer. CSCs resist uptake of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs through a number of mechanisms, including increasing expression of ALDH1. Thus, ALDH1 is considered a marker for cancer stem cells. Recent studies have shown that CCL2 enhances cancer stem cell renewal of some luminal breast cancer cell lines in vitro. However, the relevance of CCL2 expression to cancer stem cell renewal in TNBC is unclear. Therefore, we first determined the effect of CCL2 gene silencing on the numbers of CD24-/CD44+ cells, a well characterized breast cancer stem cell population. By FACs analysis, Ca-TAT delivery of huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2 decreased the numbers of CD24-/CD44+ cells by over 50% (Figure 5A). By immunohistochemistry analysis of MDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts, we observed a significant reduction in ALDH1 expression in CCL2 deficient tumors (Figure 5B). These data indicate that CCL2 knockdown inhibits ALDH1 expression and numbers of CD24-/CD44+ cells in breast tumor xenografts.CCL2 gene silencing in breast cancer cells by Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes inhibits cancer stem cell renewalA-B. MDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts (N=6 animals per group) were treated with control (Con) or Ca-TAT complexed to CCL2 siRNAs (huCCL2si1, huCCL2si2), and were analyzed for CD24 and CD44 expression by flow cytometry (A), or ALDH1 expression by immunohistochemistry stain (B). ALDH1 expression was quantified by Image J; arbitrary units are shown. Scale bar=100 microns. C. MDA-MB-231 cells in culture were transfected with Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes and examined for mammosphere formation. Representative images are shown at passage 4. Scale bar=200 microns. Statistical analysis was performed by One Way ANOVA followed by Bonferonni post-hoc comparisons with Control group. Statistical significance was determined by p-value less than 0.05. *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Mean+SEM is shown.We also examined that the effects of CCL2 gene silencing on mammosphere formation in vitro. The mammosphere assay, developed by Dontu et al involves culturing of breast epithelial cells under low attachment conditions, which form spheroids in suspension. When these mammospheres were diassociated, these cells grew into new spheroids, which could be measured as an indicator of self\u2013renewal. Dontu et al showed that mammospheres included a mix of progenitor and stem cells. When plated onto a 2D substrate, these spheroids differentiated into ductal and myoepithelial cells. When we cultured MDA-MB-231 cells under low attachment conditions, these cells formed asymmetrical cellular aggregates or \u201cmammospheres,\u201d which could be passaged a minimum of four times, consistent with previous studies. Mammospheres were transfected with Ca-TAT peptides complexed to control or CCL2siRNAs once every passage for up to 4 passages. Compared to the control siRNA treated group, huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2 significantly decreased the numbers of cellular aggregates formed by MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Figure 5C). Consistently, Ca-TAT delivery of huCCL2si1 and huCCL2si2 resulted in fewer numbers of DCIS.com mammospheres at passage 4 (Supplementary Figure 1). Taken together, these data indicate that CCL2 gene silencing inhibits self-renewal of MDA-MB-231and DCIS.com breast cancer cells.Ca-TAT delivery of CCL2 siRNAs inhibit macrophage recruitment in MDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenograftsTo investigate the mechanisms contributing to the decreased growth and invasion of CCL2 deficient tumors, we examined the possibility that reduced bioavailability of CCL2 protein would inhibit stromal reactivity in the primary tumor. CCL2 promotes angiogenesis and macrophage recruitment to primary tumors. Ca-TAT delivery of huCCL2si1 or huCCL2si2 lead to over a 50% reduction in CD11b+ cells in primary tumor xenografts, as determined by flow cytometry (Figure 6A). Imunohistochemistry analysis revealed increased expression of Arginase I expressing cells localized to necrotic areas in control tumors, indicating the presence of M2 macrophages. CCL2 knockdown significantly reduced the number of M2 macrophages localized to necrotic tissues (Figure 6B). CCL2 deficient tumors did not show significant differences in expression of Von Willibrand Factor 8, a blood vessel marker (Figure 6C). In summary, CCL2 gene silencing decreases M2 macrophage recruitment in TNBC xenografts, and does not significantly affect tumor angiogenesis.CCL2 gene silencing in MDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts inhibits M2 macrophage recruitment but not tumor angiogenesisMDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts were examined for A. CD11b expression by flow cytometry, B. Arginase I, or C. Von Willebrand Factor 8 (VWF8) expression, by immunohistochemistry. Scale bar=100 microns.

Statistical significance was determined by p-value less than 0.05. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, n.s= not significant. Mean+SEM is shown. N=6 animals per groupPrevious studies have shown that macrophages express CCL2, and have suggested that CCL2 regulates macrophage recruitment to primary breast tumors through a positive feedback loop. To determine the contribution of epithelial specific CCL2 to macrophage recruitment, we used a novel in vitro macrophage infiltration assay using a 3D cell culture fluidics device developed in our laboratory, termed the Metastatic Mimetic Device (MMD). The MMD consists of dual chambers with openings, which fit into one another, and swivels to create a closed system (Figure 7A). The closed system allows for the culture of cells in matrix inside the chamber. Alignment of the chamber openings permits migration of immune cells into the chamber such as macrophages. To determine the contribution of tumoral CCL2 to macrophage recruitment, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were embedded in 3D collagen in the MMD. Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes were transfected into the 3D cultures. Raw 264.7 mcherry cells were plated outside the device, and analyzed for migration into the MMD at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 7B). MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells embedded in collagen significantly enhanced migration of Raw 264.7 macrophages into the MMD compared to collagen alone, indicating that macrophage infiltration into the MMD was specific to breast cancer cells (Figure 7C). CCL2 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 or DCIS.com cells significantly inhibited the numbers of macrophages migrating into the MMD (Figure 7D, Supplementary Figure 2). These data indicate that epithelial expression of CCL2 is important for regulating macrophage recruitment.CCL2 gene silencing inhibits macrophage recruitment to MDA-MB-231 breast cancer 3D culturesA.

Mean+SEM is shown.IL-6 and VEGF are two key factors overexpressed in breast tumors. VEGF and IL-6 both regulate tumor angiogenesis. IL-6 is also associated with recruitment of myeloid cells and increased cancer cell growth and migration. CCL2 has been shown to regulate expression of IL-6 expression in lung fibroblasts and VEGF in melanoma cells. In addition, studies have shown that treatment of breast tumor xenografts with neutralizing antibodies to CCL2 lead to increased expression of IL-6 and VEGF when anti-CCL2 treatment was interrupted. These studies indicate a functional association between CCL2 expression and VEGF and IL-6. We examined expression of VEGF and IL-6 through immunostaining of MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts, and did not detect any significant changes in VEGF or IL-6 expression (Supplementary Figure 3A). MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transfected with Ca-TAT peptides complexed to CCL2 siRNAs did not show any significant changes in VEGF or IL-6 expression in conditioned medium by ELISA (Supplementary Figure 3B). These data indicate that CCL2 siRNAs do not significantly affect expression of VEGF or IL-6.DISCUSSIONThe value of CCL2 as a therapeutic target is controversial. Through a novel gene silencing approach, we show that targeting CCL2 expression inhibits tumor progression associated with a reduction in cancer stem cells and M2 macrophages. Previous studies have mainly used neutralizing antibodies to evaluate the role of CCL2 in tumor progression. However, this approach does not affect CCL2 expression. Our studies indicate that targeting CCL2 expression may provide significant therapeutic effects to treat TNBC.For the first time, we provide proof of concept data that Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes are capable of penetrating breast tumors and inducing gene silencing. Currently, systemic delivery remains the most commonly used method for distributing drugs to primary and secondary tumor tissues, but is highly inefficient, frequently leading to insufficient drug penetration into tissues. These studies underscore a need to identify alternative treatment strategies to enhance both specificity and efficacy of treatment. Localized delivery of drugs to human cancer patients have long been considered a selective and potentially more effective approach for enhancing drug efficacy. In our studies, we show that local delivery of CCL2 siRNAs through Ca-TAT peptide complexes lead to efficient and sustained CCL2 knockdown in tumor cells, without adversely affecting viability or gene expression in surrounding normal mammary tissue. Localized delivery of Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes to tissues with metastatic lesions could also be effective in therapeutic intervention. Recent studies demonstrated that intra-tracheal delivery of Ca-TAT/pDNA complexes penetrated primary lung cancer. This approach could be used to treat breast cancer patients with existing lung metastases. Further studies must be performed to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and long-term safety of different delivery approaches of Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes for therapeutic intervention of distant metastasis.One possible concern with local injection is the ability of the Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes to reach their target site before dissociation, due to the weak calcium ionic interactions. A major factor affecting disassociation of the Ca-TAT complexes is pH. Studies of Ca-TAT complexes in the cytosol indicate that low pH may mediate disassociation of the Ca-TAT complexes. At pH 7.4, the particle size of the complexes was shown to be approximately 250 nm irrespective of the CPP used. Particle size increased when the pH was lowered to 4.4, suggesting that an acidic environment reverses the condensing effect of calcium. This pH-induced dissociation was previously reported for DNA/calcium complexes. At the neutral pH, the zeta potential values were positive, indicating that the positively charged CPPs form the bulk of the condensed gene complexes. The net charge on the particles was switched when the pH was lowered, and the gene complexes became anionic or neutral. These data indicate that lowering the environmental pH destabilized the non-covalently condensed pDNA complexes, allowing the pDNA to be exposed or released from the complex. This hypothesis is further supported by other studies of calcium and DNA precipitates, which were shown to dissociate when exposed to similar conditions. The pH in the extracellular space is approximately 7.4 under normal conditions and 7.1 in tumor tissues. Despite the lower pH in the extracellular space of tumor tissues, previous studies showed that Ca-K9 peptide/pDNA complexes significantly attenuated lung tumor growth macroscopically and microscopically when delivered by tail vein injection. These studies indicated that calcium condensed peptide/pDNA complexes were capable of traveling from the tail to the lung before disassociating within the lung tumor cells. Further studies must be performed to more precisely measure the radius from the injection site at disassociation might occur.CCL2 antibody neutralization inhibited tumor progression in mice bearing 4T1 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts. When anti-CCL2 treatment was stopped midway and 4T1 tumors were surgically removed, the anti-CCL2 treated mice showed increased metastasis associated with increased expression of IL-6 and VEGF, compared to control IgG treated mice. From these data, the authors suggested that cessation of CCL2 inhibition may accelerate metastasis by enhancing expression of pro-angiogenic factors. However, it was unclear from that study whether CCL2 antibody neutralization had any significant effects on CCL2 expression levels in the tumors. A phase I clinical trial study on CCL2 antibody neutralization in rheumatoid arthritis patients showed that antibody bound CCL2 complexes were still biologically active and that CCL2 levels were increased in patients. Therefore, it is possible that anti-CCL2 treatment could sequester CCL2 temporarily, but not prevent long-term clearance of CCL2. As a result, CCL2 levels would accumulate once the antibody itself became inactive. In our study, we showed that siRNA delivery effectively reduced CCL2 expression in the primary tumors to levels normally found in normal mammary tissues, and suppressed tumor progression. However, we did not observe any significant changes in VEGF or IL-6 expression in MDA-MB-231 breast tumor xenografts or cells. It is likely that multiple mechanisms regulate expression of these factors. For example, IL-1 and TGF-\u03b2 are expressed in breast cancer, and regulate VEGF and IL-6 expression. In summary, our data suggest that directly targeting CCL2 expression would be a more effective means to inhibiting CCL2 biological activity in vivo, compared to antibody neutralization. Furthermore, it may not be necessary to eliminate CCL2 expression levels from the tumor to inhibit tumor progression.In our studies, we found that CCL2 knockdown increased expression of LC3B, indicating cellular autophagy. Autophagy has been associated with cancer cell survival as a means to conserve energy when experiencing metabolic stress. Knockdown of autophagy related genes ATG7 or Beclin1 enhanced necrotic cell death in fibrosarcoma cells, indicating that autophagy protects against necrotic cell death. On the other hand, autophagy may also be important for promoting cell death. Autophagic cell death was observed with treatment of ovarian cancer cells with platinum or pituitary cancer cells with cyclosporine. Knockdown of ATG-7 or Beclin1 inhibited necrosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. In our studies, it is possible that the increased autophagy in our studies represented a pro-survival mechanism as a reaction to CCL2 knockdown, or functioned to promote cell death. To further characterize the role and mechanisms of autophagy in CCL2 signaling in breast cancer, extensive studies on the autophagy pathway and cell death would be necessary. These studies are beyond the scope of this report, but are of interest in the future.Our data indicate that CCL2 gene silencing significantly remodeled the microenvironment to suppress tumor progression. In tumors treated with Ca-TAT/control siRNA complexes, central necrosis was surrounded by a large peripheral zone of proliferating tumor cells. Furthermore M2 macrophages were localized to the necrotic areas. These phenotypes in the control tumors are consistent with previous studies showing that tumors may potentially exploit hypoxia induced by necrosis to upregulate angiogenesis and recruit M2 macrophages. CCL2 knockdown increased necrosis in the primary tumor. Fewer macrophages were observed in necrotic tissues, and no significant changes in angiogenesis were detected. These studies indicate that decreased CCL2 levels in the primary tumor inhibit the ability of invasive breast tumors to exploit the surrounding host cells. In contrast, antibody neutralization of CCL2 in tumor xenografts enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. CCL2 gene silencing may provide a more selective therapeutic advantage in cases where tumors are resistant to apoptosis.Targeting cancer stem cells represents a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention of recurrent or metastatic breast cancers, which often develop resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics. In vitro studies have shown that commonly used therapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel, selects for survival of breast cancer stem cell populations, possibly contributing to tumor recurrence over time. Cancer stem cells resist the effects of chemotherapeutic drugs through a number of mechanisms including: drug efflux through transporter proteins, pro-survival signaling, increased ALDH1 expression and quiescence. In our studies, we demonstrated that CCL2 gene silencing in MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts inhibited ALDH1 expression, and reduced the number of CD24-/CD44+ cells. One likely mechanism is that Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes directly inhibited the growth of CSCs, as indicated by mammosphere assays. Through an indirect mechanism, the reduction in macrophages in CCL2 deficient tumors may have also affected CSC renewal, as M2 macrophages express soluble factors that promote cancer stem cell renewal, tumor growth and invasion. Thus, CCL2 gene silencing via TAT/siRNA complexes inhibit key mechanisms that promote progression of TNBC.In summary, CCL2 knockdown through delivery of Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes could be an effective treatment strategy for the treatment of invasive breast cancer, particularly when combined with other anti-cancer therapies. Combined with previous studies, our studies indicate that Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes selectively penetrate tumor tissues. TAT peptides are already being tested in the clinic for the treatment of heart disease. Translating Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes as an anti-cancer strategy in the clinic is highly feasible. This low toxicity, high versatility approach supports translation of Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes to the clinic for the treatment of cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell cultureMDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection. Cancer associated fibroblasts were isolated from invasive breast ductal carcinoma and characterized in previous studies. DCIS.com cells were generously provided by Fariba Behbod, PharmD, Ph.D (University of Kansas Medical Center). Raw 264.7 mcherry cells were generously provided by George Veilhauer, Ph.D (University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS). All cell lines were cultured on plastic in DMEM media containing 10% FBS with 0.1% amphotericin, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (cat no. 30-004-CI, Cellgro).siRNA/plasmid reagentsSense and anti-sense oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed by GE Dharmacon. The following siRNA targeting sequences were designed: enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) as a negative control:5\u2032-GCUGACCCUGAAGUUCAUC-3\u2032, huCCL2si1: 5\u2032-ACCUGCUGUUAUAACUUCA-3\u2032, huCCL2si2: 5\u2032-CAGCAAGUGUCCC AAAGAA-3\u2032.Preparation of Ca-TAT complexesThe following formula was used to determine the amount of TAT peptide needed for a specific N/P ratio per \u03bcg of DNA or siRNA: \u03bcg of TAT = 0.446 *(N/P ratio) + 0.116. For example, complexing 2.346 \u03bcg of TAT per 1 \u03bcg of DNA or siRNA would yield N/P=5. To prepare complexes, TAT peptides were mixed with siRNA or pDNA in 45 \u03bcl sterile deionized water containing: 37.5 mM, 75 mM or 112.5 mM CaCl2. The solution was pipetted vigorously for 20 times and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. For 2D and 3D cell culture studies and mammosphere assays, cells were incubated directly with the complexes for 24 hours before media replacement. For in vivo studies, 25 \u03bcl of 10 % glucose was added to the complexes, and diluted with PBS to a total volume of 100 \u03bcl before use.3D cell cultureIn each well of a 24 well plate, 100,000 breast cancer cells were embedded in 200 \u03bcl rat tail collagen (BD Pharmingen) using methods adapted from previous studies. Briefly, the pH of 2 mg/ml of stock collagen was adjusted by mixing at a 4:1 ratio with setting solution comprised of: 1X EBSS, 75 mM NaOH, and 290 mM NaHCO3. Breast cancer cells were detached from the plate by trypnization, quenched, counted by hemocytometer, and pelleted by centrifugation. 100,000 cells were mixed thoroughly with 250 \u03bcL collagen solution and pipetted directly in each well, and incubated at 37C for 30 minutes for polymerization of collagen. Cells were incubated in 1 ml of DMEM/10% FBS for 24 hours prior to transfection.ELISAFor each well in a 24 well plate, 40,000 cells were seeded in a monolayer or 100,000 cells were seeded in collagen for 24 hours in DMEM/10% FBS. To generate conditioned medium, cells were washed in PBS and incubated in serum free DMEM for 24 hours in 500 \u03bcl volume per well. Conditioned media generated from indicated cell lines were subject to ELISA specific to human CCL2 (cat no.900-M31, Peprotech), VEGF (cat no. 900-K10, Peprotech) or IL-6 (cat no. 900-K16, Peprotech). Samples were analyzed according to manufacturer protocol. Reactions were catalyzed using tetramethylbenzidine substrate (cat no. 34028, Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was read at OD 450 nM using a BioTek Microplate Reader.Animal care and surgeryFemale athymic Foxn1nu/nu mice, 6-8 weeks old (Balb/c background) were purchased from Envigo, Inc. Animals were maintained at the University of Kansas Medical Center, in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC). All animal experiments were performed at the University of Kansas Medical Center under an approved IACUC. 250,000 human carcinoma associated fibroblasts were embedded with 100,000 MDA-MB-231 cells in 50 \u03bcl of collagen rat tail collagen I (BD Pharmingen), using methods previously described. One collagen plugs was transplanted into each mouse, in the #4-5 inguinal mammary glands. When the tumors reached 0.5 cm in diameter, 10 \u03bcg (100 \u03bcl) of Ca-TAT/control or Ca-TAT/CCL2 siRNA nanoparticles were injected into the primary tumor in 4 different areas of the tumor, using a 27 gauge needle. Each mouse received a total of 3 injections of Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes. Animals were monitored twice weekly for tumor formation by palpation and measurement by caliper. Animals were euthanized 30 days post-transplantation, when control tumors reached maximum allowable tumor size, approximately 1.5 cm3 (Figure 2A).Tissue embeddingTissues were fixed in 10 % neutral formalin buffer for 24 hours. Tissues were embedded in wax as described. Briefly, tissues were dehydrated in a series of alcohols: 70, 90, 100% ethanols for 1 hour each. Tissues were further dehydrated in isopropanol for 1 hour, 50:50 ratio of isopropanol: paraffin wax at 60\u00b0C for 1 hour and then in wax at 60\u00b0C overnight. Tissues were placed into the wax containing molds and allowed to harden at room temperature. Tissues were then processed for histological analysis.Histology/immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescenceWax embedded sections were sectioned at 5 micron thickness onto 1 mm glass slides, dewaxed and rehydrated as described. For H&E stain, slides were incubated in Harris's hematoxylin for 2 minutes and eosin for 2 minutes prior to dehydration and mounting in Cytoseal. For immunostaining, tissue sections were subjected to antigen retrieval through heating in low pressure in sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 2 minutes. Slides were washed in PBS, and endogenous peroxidases were quenched in PBS containing 60 % methanol and 3% H2O2. Samples were blocked in PBS containing 3% fetal bovine serum for 1 hour, and incubated with primary antibodies (1:100) to: cleaved caspase-3 Asp 175 (cat no. 9579, Cell Signaling Technology), HMGB1 (cat no.6393, Cell Signaling Technology), LC3B (cat no. L10382, Life Technologies), VWF8 (cat no. Ab7356, Millipore), arginase I (cat no. sc20150, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or VEGF (cat no. sc-152, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Slides were washed in PBS three times, incubated with secondary rabbit biotinylated antibodies at 1:1000 dilution (cat no. BA-5000, Vector Labs) for 2 hours, conjugated with streptavidin peroxidase (cat no. PK-4000, Vector Labs) and incubated with DAB substrate (cat no. K346711, Dako). For detection of PCNA or IL-6 endogenous mouse immunoglobulins were first incubating with blocking reagents from the Mouse on Mouse kit (cat no. BMK-2202, Vector Laboratories), according to commercial protocol. Slides were incubated with PCNA antibodies (cat no. sc25280, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or IL-6 antibodies (cat no. MAB-2061m RnD Systems) at a 1:100 for 1 hour and then incubated with secondary mouse biotinylated antibodies from the MOM kit at a 1:250 dilution for 1 hour. For detection of CD24, slides were incubated with antibodies at a 1:100 (cat no. 561777 BD Pharmingen), and detected with secondary rat-biotinylated antibodies (cat no.BA-9401, Vector Laboratories) at a 1:1000 dilution. Sections were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin for 1 minute, dehydrated and mounted with Cytoseal. Because tumor sections were of various sizes, it was determined that 4 fields could be captured consistently among tumor samples, while enabling a good representation of the tumor. Therefore, four random fields per section, with 2 sections per sample, were captured at 10 x magnification using a Motic AE 31 microscope with Infinity2-1c color digital camera. DAB staining was quantified by pixel density analysis, normalized to total tumor area, using an Image J software protocol (NIH) described in previous studies.For immunofluorescence, sections were incubated at 1:100 dilution of antibodies to Cytokeratin 5 (CK5, cat no. XM-26, ThermoFisher) and Calsequestrin (cat no. SC-28274, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies overnight at at 4\u00b0C, conjugated with anti-rabbit-Alexa-568 and anti-mouse-Alexa-488 at a 1:500 dilution for 2 hours. Sections were washed in PBS, counterstained with DAPI and mounted with PBS/glycerol.Quantification of tumor necrosisTo quantify the extent of necrosis in breast tumor xenografts, tumor tissues were sectioned at 5 different depths, approximately 50 microns apart. 3 sections from each depth were placed on a slide and stained by H&E. Sections were imaged at 4x magnification, at 2-3 fields per section to capture the whole tissue section. Software analysis for necrotic areas in breast tissues was performed using methods adapted from previous studies. Images were first imported into Adobe Photoshop. Color and exposure of images were normalized using auto-contrast. Necrotic areas were selected using a lasso tool, copied to a new window and saved a separate file. Images were opened in Image J software (NIH), and converted to grey scale. Background pixels resulting from luminosity of brightfield images were removed by threshold adjustment. Images were the subject to particle analysis. Necrotic areas and total areas were expressed as particle area values of arbitrary units. Values representing necrotic areas were normalized to values representing total tissue section.Scoring of tumor invasionTo quantify the extent of tumor invasion into muscle tissue, tumor tissues were sectioned at 3 different depths approximately 50 microns apart. Three serial sections from each depth were placed on each slide and stained by H&E. The muscle tissue was distinguished by a striated appearance that was strongly positive for eosin stain. Each section from each sample was scored for extent of invasion by analysis of slides at 4x and 10x magnification. Three different individuals in blinded studies used a numerical scoring system. 0 indicated no to low invasion, characterized by no or a few tumor viable cells present in muscle tissue, or the presence of necrotic tumor cells in muscle tissue; the border between muscle and tumor tissue was well defined. 1 indicated some tumor cell invasion, characterized by viable tumor cells present in muscle tissue; the border between muscle and tumor tissue was less defined. 2 indicated high invasion characterized by extensive number of tumor cells in muscle tissue; tumor was embedded in muscle, and the border between muscle tissue and tumor undefined.Quantitation of lung metastasesMetastatic nodules in lung tissues were detected and quantified using hematoxylin staining approach of lung tissues, as previously described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were dehydrated a series of alcohols: 70, 90, 100% ethanols for 1 hour each and cleared in xylene overnight. Tissues were rehydrated in decreasing series of ethanols, flushed with running tap water for 15 minutes and then stained with Gill's hematoxylin for 10 minutes. Lung tissues were flushed with water for 5 minutes, de-stained in 1 % HCl for 20 minutes, and then incubated in tap water overnight. Tissues were partially dehydrated in 70% ethanol for 1 hour. Metastatic lesions throughout the lung tissue were visually identified by hematoxylin staining as round shaped nodules under brightfield/phase contrast microscopy using a Motic AE31 inverted microscope (Motic AE31). Metastatic nodules were manually scored in the lung tissues. The presence of metastases was confirmed by paraffin embedding of whole tissue, and H&E stain of lung sections.Flow cytometryFor adherent cells in culture, cells were first detached from plastic by washing in PBS twice, and incubation in 3 mM EDTA at 37\u00b0C for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed with 10 ml of complete medium twice, fixed in 10 % neutral formalin buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature and washed with PBS twice to remove traces of formalin. For tumor tissues, tissues were washed in PBS, and digested into single cell suspensions with collagenase I and trypsin for 4 hours at 37\u00b0C, as described in previous studies. Tumor cell suspensions were fixed in 10% NBF for overnight at 4C, and then washed with PBS twice to remove traces of formalin. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton-X 100 in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 15 minutes, and washed in PBS twice. Samples were incubated with the following antibodies at 1: 50 dilution, overnight on ice in PBS containing 2% BSA: CD24- PE (cat no.555428, BD Pharmingen), CD11b-APC-Cy7 (cat. no 557657, BD Pharmingen), murine CCL2 (cat no. 1784, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), human CCL2 (cat no. sc1304, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) Ki67 (cat no. Sc15402, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HMGB1 (cat no. 6893, Cell Signaling Technology) or LC3B (cat no. L10382, Invitrogen). Samples were incubated with anti-Fsp1 at a dilution of 1:3 (cat no. ab75550, Abcam). Murine CCL2 and human CCL2 were detected by secondary goat antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 (1:500) in PBS for 1 hour on ice, covered in foil. Fsp1, Ki67, HMGB1, LC3B were detected by secondary rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa-647 at a 1:500 dilution on ice for 1 hour. Cells were washed with PBS three times prior to analysis. Samples were analyzed on a LSRII Flow cytometer, normalized to secondary antibody only controls.Mammosphere assay30,000 cells were seeded in low attachment 6 well plates (Corning) in 3 ml of DMEM/10% FBS. 48 hours after plating, cells were transfected with Ca-TAT complexed to 3 ug of control, huCCL2si1 or huCCLsi2 siRNAs. After an additional 5 days in culture, mammospheres were collected in 15 ml conical tubes, pelleted, and disassociated using 20 mM Trypsin/2 mm EDTA solution for 7 minutes at 37C. Cells were pelleted and replated for 48 hours before re-transfection with Ca-TAT/siRNA complexes. Images were captured using the EVOS FL auto every 7 days of plating. Mammospheres were counted using Image J software.3D macrophage infiltration assayMMD fluidic devices were fabricated by MetaBioscience LLC (Overland Park, KS). For each chamber device, 100,000 breast cancer cells were embedded in 250 \u03bcl rat tail collagen (BD Pharmingen), as described for 3D cultures. Devices were placed in 6 well dishes. 1 ml of DMEM/10% FBS was pipetted into the device and incubated overnight. After overnight incubation of the devices, 500,000 Raw 264.7 mcherry cells were counted and re-suspended into 2.5 ml of DMEM/10% FBS for each device. Devices were twisted open and cells were pipetted into each well, outside of the device. Devices were imaged daily at 10x magnification using an EVOS FL auto imaging system (Invitrogen) for up to 48 hours. The number of macrophages were measured by quantification of fluorescence using methods previously described.Statistical analysisAll experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Data are expressed as mean+ standard error of the mean (SEM) Statistical analysis was determined using Two-Tailed T-test or ANOVA with Bonferonni's post-hoc comparisons using Graphpad Software.

Here, we characterize four CAF subsets in breast cancer with distinct properties and levels of activation. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF-S1, CAF-S4) accumulate differentially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote an immunosuppressive environment through a multi-step mechanism. By secreting CXCL12, CAF-S1 attracts CD4<sup+</supCD25<sup+</sup T lymphocytes and retains them by OX40L, PD-L2, and\u00a0JAM2.

        "content": "Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play important roles in breast cancer development and progression. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRNAs) are the main regulators in CAFs. MiR-29b is one of the significant down-regulated miRNAs in CAFs from the miRNA screening. The role of miR-29b in the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis regulated by miR-29b. We found that fibroblasts activated by co-cultured breast cancer cells produced higher levels of some chemokines like CCL11, CXCL14, which accelerated breast cancer cell growth and induced drug resistance and metastasis. Increased miR-29b expression in activated fibroblasts could suppress the activating p38-STAT1 signal pathway in breast cancer cells. We also found that the expression of CCL11 and CXCL14 could be regulated by miR-29b in CAFs. Our results illustrate that down-regulation of miR-29b in CAFs plays an important role in tumor stroma by activating p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells. The study indicates that cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction promotes breast cancer cell growth, drug resistance, migration and invasion due to the lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs.",

Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRNAs) are the main regulators in CAFs. MiR-29b is one of the significant down-regulated miRNAs in CAFs from the miRNA screening. The role of miR-29b in the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis regulated by miR-29b. We found that fibroblasts activated by co-cultured breast cancer cells produced higher levels of some chemokines like CCL11, CXCL14, which accelerated breast cancer cell growth and induced drug resistance and metastasis. Increased miR-29b expression in activated fibroblasts could suppress the activating p38-STAT1 signal pathway in breast cancer cells. We also found that the expression of CCL11 and CXCL14 could be regulated by miR-29b in CAFs. Our results illustrate that down-regulation of miR-29b in CAFs plays an important role in tumor stroma by activating p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells. The study indicates that cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction promotes breast cancer cell growth, drug resistance, migration and invasion due to the lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs.INTRODUCTIONThe tumor microenvironment plays very important roles in the development and progression of cancer. Cancer tissues consist of various cells include cancer cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, immune cells and various bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. Fibroblasts are the most enriched cells in tumor stroma. The activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the cancer niche build a permissive and supportive microenvironment for tumor development. Fibroblasts play important roles in cancer progression including metabolism, metastasis, proliferation, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and chemo-resistance by interaction with cancer cells or other cells. Fibroblasts could affect behaviors of cancer cells by activating signal pathways, microRNAs (miRNAs), and soluble molecules and so on.MiRNAs are a type of non-coding small RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at a posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3\u2032 UTR of its target genes. More and more research focus on the roles of miRNAs in fibroblasts. Fibroblasts secrete a variety of chemokines, growth factors, cytokines, which can be regulated by miRNAs. Down-regulation of miR-149, miR-21, miR-409, miR-26b, miR-205, miR-31 and up-regulation of miR-34b and miR-34c expression could transform resident fibroblasts to carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The reported miRNAs could regulate gene expression in fibroblasts and then control cancer development and progression by regulating cytokines or chemokines. Chemokines are critical signaling mediators, which involve in the communication between the cancer cells and fibroblasts through binding to their receptors. Cell survival, proliferation, stem cell properties, ECM attachment, adhesion, metastasis in tissues or to other organs including proteolysis of the basement membrane, locomotion and colony formation will be changed according to the signals from the CAFs.Our previous screening data showed that miR-29b is one of the significant down-regulated miRNAs in CAFs. Our study is to determine how miR-29b influences chemokine secretion of CAFs and its role in the regulation of proliferation, drug resistance and metastasis of breast cancer cells.RESULTSMiR-29b expression down-regulates in CAFsCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the tissues of breast cancer. \u03b1-SMA is the most common marker of CAFs, and it was significantly up-regulated in CAFs than in NFs using immunofluorescence assay (Figure 1A). The markers of CAFs including MCT1, MCT4, \u03b1-SMA and FSP1 were examined by western blotting. It was found that MCT1, MCT4, \u03b1-SMA and FSP1 protein levels were higher than them in NFs, but CAV-1 was significantly down-regulated in CAFs (Figure 1B). Cell proliferation was assayed for SKBR3 with conditioned medium (CM) from NFs or CAFs treatment by colony formation assay (Figure 1C). The results indicated that CAFs were different from NFs, and CAFs showed the features of the activated fibroblasts. It was also shown that CAFs promoted cell migration of SKBR3 cells (Figure 1D\u20131E).Lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs(A) \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs and NFs by immunofluorescence assay.

MiR-29b is one of the down-regulated miRNA in CAFs (Supplementary Table 1). It was also found that miR-29b including miR-29b-1-5p (miR-29b-1) and miR-29b-2-5p (miR-29b-2) were down-regulated in CAFs compared to NFs (Figure 1F\u20131G). These indicated that miR-29b may play a suppressing role in CAFs.CAFs with miR-29b inhibits breast cancer cellular growthTo further investigate the role of miR-29b in CAFs on breast cancer cells, CAFs cells were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 and their expression increased (Supplementary Figure 1). Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. It was found that miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 could inhibit cell survival in three breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7 and SKBR3 (Figure 2A\u20132B). Next, colony formation assay was used for evaluate cell survival ability. It was shown that miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression in CAFs reduced the number of colonies of breast cancer cells, specially, in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2C\u20132D). Cell cycle, reflecting the cell proliferation, was analyzed by flow cytometry in breast cancer cells after co-culturing CAFs with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression. The result showed that miR-29b-1 and miR-29b-2 could decrease the ratio of G1, G2/M phase and increase S phase in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells (Figure 2E\u20132F). Breast cancer models were set up using nude mice injected with MCF-7 cells and used to verify the effect of miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 on cell growth in vivo. It was found that MCF-7 cells mixed with CAFs could accelerate tumor growth than MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells mixed with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpressed CAFs attenuated tumor growth (Figure 2G). There was a similar result in breast cancer models using BT474 cells (Figure 2H). These data suggested that CAFs with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression suppressed breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.CAFs enhances breast cancer cellular viability by down-regulation of miR-29b(A-B) CAFs were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 mimics for 24h and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells.

The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01.MiR-29b regulates the expression of cytokines in CAFsThe bioinformatics analysis showed that 3\u2032-UTRs of the CCL11, CCL18, CXCL9, CXCL14 and CXCL17 contain the binding sites with miR-29b-1 (Supplementary Figure 2). 3\u2032-UTRs of the CCL11, CCL4L1, CCL4L2 and CXCL14 have the binding sites of miR-29b-2 (Supplementary Figure 3). To know whether miR-29b regulates the expression of the predicted targeted cytokines, activated CAFs and Hs578Bst fibroblasts (Hs578BstCM) were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 and the mRNA levels of endogenous cytokines were measured by real time RT-PCR. The results showed that CCL11 and CCL18 mRNA decreased when CAFs and Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-1, and the mRNA levels of CXCL9, CXCL14 and CXCL17 were slightly decreased (Figure 3A). CCL11 and CXCL14 mRNA decreased when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-2, but mRNAs of CCL4L1 and CCL4L2 were not changed significantly (Figure 3B).MiR-29b regulates CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in fibroblasts(A) miR-29b-1 restoration down-regulated CCL11 and CCL18 mRNA in CAFs and Hs578Bst fibroblasts treated with conditioned medium from cancer (Hs578BstCM).

(C-D) miR-29b-1 suppressed the expression of a luciferase reporter gene harboring the 3\u2032-UTR of CCL11 or CCL18. (E-F) miR-29b-2 suppressed the expression of a luciferase reporter gene harboring the 3\u2032-UTR of CCL11 and CXCL14. (G) Cells were transfected with miR-29b-1, miR-29b-2 or miR-control for 48 hours, then collected for ELISA. (I) Cells were transfected with miR-29b-1, miR-29b-2 or miR-control for 48 hours, then collected for western blotting. The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *:p<0.05, **: p<0.01.Next, to confirm that CCL11 and CCL18 were the target genes of miR-29b-1 and CCL11 and CXCL14 were the target genes of miR-29b-2, plasmids with 3\u2032 UTR of CCL11, CCL18 and CXCL14 were constructed. CAFs and Hs578BstCM were transfected with CCL11, CCL18 or CXCL14 3\u2032 UTRs and miR-29b, and luciferase activities were assayed. The results showed that the luciferase activities of wide types of CCL11 and CCL18 3\u2032 UTR in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-1 were much lower than miRNA controls (Figure 3C\u20133D). The luciferase activities of wide types of CCL11 and CXCL14 3\u2032 UTR in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-2 were much lower than miRNA controls (Figure 3E\u20133F). CCL11, CCL18 protein levels decreased significantly when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-1(Figure 3G\u20133H). CCL11, CCL14 protein levels decreased significantly when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-2 (Figure 3G\u20133H). CCL11 and CXCL14 protein decreased in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-2 transfection by western blotting (Figure 3I). When miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 was suppressed in MCF-7 cells, CCL11 and CXCL14 were inhibited at mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Figure 4). So, the data clearly indicated that CCL11 and CXCL14 were the direct target genes of miR-29b in CAFs or Hs579BstCM.MiR-29b restoration in CAFs inhibits breast cancer cellular viability and metastasis by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14To further investigate the role of miR-29b in fibroblasts on breast cancer cells, CAFs cells were transfected with miR-29b and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells exposed to CCL11 and CXCL14 (10ng/ml) for 24h. Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. It was found that miR-29b could inhibit breast cancer cell survival and also suppressed cell growth by CCL11 and CXCL14 stimulation (Figure 4A\u20134B). MiR-29b could inhibit breast cancer cell migration via CCL11 or CXCL14 from CAFs (Figure 4C\u20134D). Breast cancer cell invasion ability was also inhibited by miR-29b, which could suppress CCL11 and CXCL14 enhanced invasion (Figure 4E\u20134F). When the cells were transfected miR-29-1 or miR-29-2 inhibitors, cell survival ability and migration were enhanced (Supplementary Figure 5).MiR-29b restoration in CAFs inhibits breast cancer cellular viability and metastasis by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14CAFs were transfected with miR-29b mimics or treated with CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24h and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells.

The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01.CAFs with low level of miR-29b increases breast cancer cell drug resistance by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14CAFs could induce drug resistance of cancer cells. Here, to know whether there are differences of miR-29b down-regulation on drug resistance of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14. The cell survival rates were examined using colony formation assay. The results indicated that CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 could lead to breast cancer cells growing more slowly than breast cancer cells with CM-CAFs treatment, which had higher survival ability than the parent cells (Figure 5A\u20135B). Cell apoptosis was also examined in the MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 with paclitaxel or CCL11 or CXCL14 treatment for 24 hours. It was shown that MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 showed more apoptosis rates than the cells with CM-CAFs treatment (Figure 5C\u20135D).CAFs with miR-29b down-regulation regulates breast cancer cell drug resistance by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14(A-B) MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and then exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24 hours. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates for two weeks and cell survival ability was evaluated using colony formation assay. (C-D) MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and then exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24 hours. Cells were labeled with AnnexinV and apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry.

We found that p38 was activated in MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs treatment, however, in the CM-CAFs/miR-29b or STAT1 is one of down-stream transcriptional factor of p38 and it was also inhibited in the breast cancer cells with CM-CAFs/miR-29b or CM-CAFs/miR-29b treatment. CM-CAFs/miR-29b treated cells decreased the activated p38 (Figure 6A and 6B). Other down-stream gene such as ELK1 and PAX6 were also changed.MiR-29b down-regulation in CAFs activates p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells(A) p38 and p38 down-stream gene expression in MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 and CCL11 treatment.

The data are shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01, and -: no significance.To know whether STAT1 involves in the chemokine expression of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were transfected with STAT1 siRNA or treated with STAT1 inhibitor, CCL11 and CXCL14 were assayed by ELISA. The results showed that inhibition of STAT1 could reduce the levels of CCL11 and CXCL14 (Figure 6C). When the cells were transfected with STAT1 siRNA and treated with CCL11 or CXCL14, cell proliferation enhancement by CCL11 or CXCL14 was inhibited in the cells with STAT1 down-regulation (Figure 6D). The results from MTT assay indicated that inhibition of STAT1 suppressed the cell survival ability significantly in MCF-7 cells.DISCUSSIONAlthough the stromal cells in the tumor environment including fibroblasts are not malignant, their altered gene expression profiles influence the cellular function and signal pathways of stroma cells, tumor cell behaviors by the communication between tumor cells and stroma. Fibroblasts are the most common cell type found in the tumor microenvironment and usually activated to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) due to the signals from the microenvironment, which are responsible for the synthesis of proteins involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as secretion of growth factors that regulate tumor cell proliferation, survival and dissemination. In the present study, we identified that miR-29b was the important molecule for the regulation of chemokines' expression in CAFs.MiRNAs have been implicated in the activation of fibroblasts. There are reports showed that miR-31, miR-148a and others are down-regulated in activated fibroblasts. Previous study showed that miR-29b is down-regulated in prostate cancer and breast cancer. Our study showed that miR-29b was down-regulated in CAFs, when miR-29b was introduced into CAFs, the characteristics of CAFs were like NFs (not shown). MiR-29b acts as a tumor suppressor in most cancer types. Our results supported that miR-29b plays a suppressor role in tumor stroma.There are reports shown that fibroblasts involve in the cross-talk of cancer cells and fibroblasts by secreting CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL6, CXCL12, IL6, CXCL16 and others. In the study, we identified that CCL11 and CXCL14 were the target genes of miR-29b in fibroblasts. When miR-29b expression is downregulated in CAFs or activated fibroblasts, CCL11 and CXCL14 expression were significantly higher than the normal fibroblasts. CCL11 and CXCL14 could secret to the outside of the cells and they mainly exist in the extracellular microenvironment. MiR-29b was shown as a negative regulator of CCL11 and CXCL14, but not other chemokines predicted listing in Figure 2. When the CAFs or activated fibroblasts were transfected with miR-29b mimics, CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in the culture media were suppressed. CCL11 and CXCL14 from the CAFs will exert on breast cancer cell and then promotes cell proliferation and metastasis. Further molecular mechanism exploration indicated CCL11 and CXCL14 could active p38-STAT1 pathway in breast cancer cells. Our findings showed that lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs could promote CCL11 and CXCL14 expression, which activate p38 and then promote cell proliferation and metastasis.The selected significant miRNAs from the CAFs and NFsCAFs/NFs>2 meant that miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in CAFs. CAFs/NFs<0.5 meant that miRNAs were significantly down-regulated in CAFs.\t \tIn a conclusion, as shown in Figure 6E, our study elucidated that lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs could promote cellular viability and metastasis by activating p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells by up-regulation of CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in CAFs. STAT1 could promote CCL11, CXCL14 and CCL2 production and then accelerate cell proliferation. This is a positive feedback process. There need more studies to evaluate the function of other miRNAs aberrantly regulated in CAFs and their network. Revealing the molecular mechanisms involved in CAFs-mediated cancer growth and progression may be beneficial for finding new cancer therapy targets.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and cultureThe breast cancer cell lines were originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100\u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Fibroblasts Hs578Bst were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Hybri-Care Medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) with 30 ng/ml EGF, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100\u03bcg/mL streptomycin. All the cell lines were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Isolation and culture of cancer-associated fibroblastsCarcinoma associated fibroblasts were isolated referred to the previously reports from five breast cancer tissues, which were diagnosed with mammary ductal carcinoma. The experiment was obtained the agreement from the Institutional Review Board of our hospital.

The tissues were cutted into about 2 mm fragments and then digested overnight at 37\u00b0C with 0.1% collagenase III (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) in DMEM and 10% FBS. The following day, the epithelial cells were separated by centrifuge. The stromal cells were washed in PBS and cultured. All experiments were performed before the 10th passage. In addition, normal fibroblasts (2cm from breast cancer tissues) were isolated according to the CAFs isolation.Co-culturing of breast cancer cells and fibroblasts and conditioned medium preparationCAFs and NFs were co-cultured with breast cancer cells with the ratio at 1:1.

At another 24 h later, the cells were collected, washed in cold PBS twice and resuspended in 1\u00d7binding buffer at a concentration of 1\u00d7106 cells/ml. After that, the cells in 100 \u03bcl solution were transferred to a 5 ml culture tube, with 5 \u03bcl Annexin V-FITC and 5 \u03bcl PI (BD Biosciences) added, and gently vortexed and incubated for 15 min at RT in the dark. And finally, 400 \u03bcl 1\u00d7 binding buffer was added to each tube to be analyzed by flow cytometry within one hour.Lentivirus carrying miRNAsVectors carrying miRNAs were constructed using the BLOCK-iT pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kit with EmGFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The primary miR-29b-1-5p and miR-29b-2-5p sequences with flanking regions were amplified by PCR and then coloned into pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR. Lentivirus for miR-29b-1-5p and miR-29b-2-5p was produced using 293T cells by co-transfection with lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the protocol according to the instruction.

        "content": "The biological heterogeneity of breast cancer leads to the need for finding new approaches to understand the mechanisms implicated in breast cancer progression. The tumor stroma appears as a key in the progression of solid tumors towards a malignant phenotype. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may orchestrate a functional \"corrupted\" stroma which in turn helps metastatic spread. In this study, we investigated by real-time PCR, the expression of 19 factors by normal breast-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) and CAFs, which were implicated in several actions promoting tumor growth, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation and invasion. Also, we explored the influence of inflammatory cells phenotypes (MMP11 status) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) on the molecular profile of CAFs. If we consider that one of the major sources of CAFs are resident NAFs, the transition of NAFs into CAFs is associated with molecular changes involving the overexpression of some molecular factors of biological importance in tumor progression. In addition, the characterization of the tumor stroma regarding to the MMP11 status by MICs reflects a type of fibroblasts which contribute even more to tumor progression. Moreover, different patterns in the induction of the expression of factors by CAFs were observed, depending on the tumor cell line which they were co-cultured with. Furthermore, CAFs influence TGF\u03b2 expression in both cancer cell lines. Therefore, this study can help to a better characterization of tumor stroma in order to improve the prognostic evaluation, as well as to define the different populations of CAFs as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Cell viability was detected by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. Wound healing experiment and transwell migration assay were used to investigate the anti-migration effects. Flow cytometry was applied to detect cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in CAFs. Culture SKBr-3 with CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) to evaluate the indirect function on the proliferation of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells. PVP inhibited the viability of CAFs by inducing apoptosis (P &lt;0.01) and arresting cell cycle (P &lt;0.01). It also inhibited the migration of CAFs (P &lt;0.01). bFGF promoted CAFs proliferation (P &lt;0.01) and migration (P &lt;0.01), protected CAFs from apoptosis (P &lt;0.05) and reduced G<sub0</sub phase to 49.06% (P &lt;0.01). However, these effects of bFGF on CAFs could be abrogated by PVP. Culturing SKBr-3 with CAFs-CM, PVP could inhibit the viability of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells indirectly. Moreover, PVP reduced the mRNA expression (P &lt;0.01) and protein secretion of bFGF (P &lt;0.01) in CAFs. PVP could exert an anti-cancer effect on breast CAFs by inhibiting bFGF expression, thus inhibiting the growth of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells indirectly.",

Hence, our findings provide novel evidence regarding the mechanisms through which the hypoxic tumor microenvironment may contribute to breast cancer progression and suggest further targets useful in more comprehensive therapeutic strategies.BackgroundThe triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for 10\u201320% of all breast malignancies, is characterized by the absence of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) without the amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC displays a high heterogeneity, aggressive features and poor overall survival rates. Targeted therapeutics for TNBC are currently limited and the chemotherapy still remains the mainstay of treatment, though the patients frequently develop resistance. Therefore, the identification of novel targeted therapies is an imperative challenge to substantially improve the outcome of the TNBC patients. In this context, hypoxia and related effectors, as the hypoxia-inducible factors, have been suggested as important hallmarks of TNBC. To date, hypoxia that represents one of the most common conditions encountered within the breast cancer microenvironment, has been associated with tumor progression, increased risk of metastasis and mortality. Malignant cells may adapt to hypoxia mainly through the action of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), which has been largely involved in tumor growth and vascularization, stromal cell recruitment, extracellular matrix remodeling, premetastatic niche formation, invasion and metastasis. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that an elevated expression of HIF-1\u03b1 has been associated with the aggressiveness of breast cancer and poor clinical outcomes. Likewise, the over-expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and the consequent hyperactivation of its target genes have been indicated as key drivers in the TNBC.Numerous transduction pathways, including the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are engaged by the hypoxia-mediated activation of the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling. In this regard, our previous studies have demonstrated that upon hypoxia and other stimulatory factors, the G protein estrogen receptor, namely GPER, may contribute to the action of HIF-1\u03b1 toward breast tumor growth and angiogenesis. For instance, HIF-1\u03b1 was shown to be required for the up-regulation of GPER by hypoxia and both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER triggered the up-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in breast cancer cells and main components of the tumor microenvironment, as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).The breast cancer microenvironment is characterized by an intricate functional interplay among epithelial cancer cells, the surrounding non-cancerous stromal cells (i.e. CAFs, adipocytes, endothelial, mesenchymal, innate and adaptive immune cells) and non-cellular components (i.e. blood and lymphatic vessels, extracellular matrix components). For instance, the bi-directional and intimate communication of cancer cells with CAFs has been reported to contribute to worse outcomes. In this vein, it is well acknowledged that cancer cells through various factors educate fibroblasts toward their pro-tumorigenic changes, which then characterize the stimulatory action of CAFs. Indeed, CAFs sustain the malignant properties of cancer cells synthesizing diverse extracellular matrix components (ECM), cytokines and growth factors, which in turn contribute to the metastatic cancer progression. In this scenario, the dynamic network occurring between cancer cells and CAFs relies on the production of many effectors, as diverse chemokines exerting tumor-promoting effects.The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family consists of several agonists, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and three receptor antagonists including the specific receptor antagonist IL1R1a. The IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) family is instead composed of more than 10 members, including the two main receptors namely IL-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) and the decoy receptor IL-1R type II. As it concerns IL-1\u03b2, its involvement in metastatic and angiogenic pathways toward breast cancer progression has been reported. In this regard, our and other previous studies have demonstrated that an estrogen-induced feedforward loop couples the IL-1\u03b2 induction in CAFs to the IL1R1-stimulatory action elicited in breast cancer cells. Likewise, high IL1\u03b2 levels within the breast tumor microenvironment have been associated with a high tumor grade and an invasive cancer phenotype.In the framework of the aforementioned data, here we first show that a positive correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression occurs in large cohorts of TNBC patients, as ascertained by querying public datasets. Thereafter, we provide novel mechanistic evidence on the hypoxia-prompted liaison between the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling and the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis, toward a metastatic gene expression profile of TNBC cells and the engagement of CAFs in facilitating invasive cancer features.MethodsPublicly available molecular datasetsGene expression analysis was performed using the publically available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) datasets. Data was downloaded on the 10 May 2020. The patients clinical information along with the mRNA expression data (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) reported in the Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort of the TCGA project were downloaded from UCSC Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/). The clinical information and the microarray gene expression data (Log2 transformed intensity values) of the METABRIC cohort (n. 2509) were retrieved from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/). Samples of the TCGA cohort (n. 1247) were filtered by the \u201csample type\u201d in order to obtain exclusively the tumor tissues (n. 1101). Thereafter, patients of both TCGA and METABRIC were classified on the basis of the presence or the absence of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), detected by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression and clinical information were also filtered for missing values. The final filtering resulted in 771 patients of TCGA and 1904 patients of METABRIC.Correlation and pathway enrichment analysisThe Pearson correlation coefficients (r-values) between the mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and the other genes of the TCGA (n. 20,530) dataset in TNBC cohort of patients were assessed in R Studio (version 3.6.1) using the cor.test() function and setting the method as \u201cPearson\u201d. The statistical analysis was performed by using the t-tests considering significant the coefficients obtained with p\u2009<\u20090.001. The first 250 most correlated genes were selected for the next evaluations. In particular, aiming to cluster these genes in pathways, we uploaded our list on the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation analysis website (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). We analyzed the genes selecting the functional annotation tool and the option Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, choosing the official gene symbol as \u201cselect identifier\u201d and gene list as \u201clist type\u201d in the options of the upload and selecting a limit species of \u201cHomo sapiens\u201d in the background.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the gsea() function of the phenoTest package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phenoTest.html) in R Studio. The KEGG \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway (KEGG entry\u2009=\u2009hsa04060) and \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d pathway (KEGG entry\u2009=\u2009hsa04066) were selected as the reference gene sets. We ranked the genes of the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway in accordance with the differential expression within HIF-1\u03b1 high and low (median expression value as threshold assessment) samples, and the \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d pathway genes in accordance with the differential expression within IL-1\u03b2 high and low (median expression value as threshold assessment) samples. Both analysis were performed only in the TNBC subgroup of patients, verifying if the selected sets of genes were enriched at the bottom or the top of the ranked lists. We calculated the enrichment score (ES) that reflects the degree to which a set of genes is overrepresented at the extremes (top or bottom) of the entire ranked list. The score was calculated by walking down a list of genes ranked by their correlation with the selected phenotype (high or low HIF-1\u03b1/ IL-1\u03b2 levels), increasing a running-sum statistic when a gene in that gene set is encountered (each vertical line underneath the enrichment plot) and decreasing it when a gene that isn\u2019t in the gene set is encountered. The magnitude of the increment depends on the correlation of one gene with the phenotype. In this analysis, 20,000 simulations were used (B\u2009=\u200920,000). p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant.ReagentsThe ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (used at a 300\u2009\u03bcM concentration) and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (used at a 10\u2009\u03bcM concentration) were purchased from Merck Life Science (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) and LY294,002 (LY) (both used at a 1\u2009\u03bcM concentration) were obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC that was solubilized in water. Recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 (used at a 10\u2009ng/mL concentration) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Life Technologies Italia, Monza, Italy) and solubilized in PBS with 1% BSA. The IL1R1 antagonist (IL1R1a) human recombinant protein (used at a 50\u2009ng/mL concentration) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific and solubilized in 20\u2009mM TBS, pH\u20098, with 50% glycerol. Anti-IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody (MAB601) was purchased from R&D Systems (Bio-Techne, Milano, Italy).Cell culturesThe TNBC MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells were provided by ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), used less than 6\u2009months after resuscitation, routinely tested and authenticated according to the ATCC suggestions. MDA-MB 231 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium) with phenol red, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). CAFs were isolated, cultured and characterized as previously described from 10 invasive mammary ductal carcinomas and pooled for the subsequent studies. Briefly, specimens were cut into 1\u20132\u2009mm diameter pieces, placed in a digestion solution (400\u2009IU collagenase, 100\u2009IU hyaluronidase, 10% FBS, antibiotics and antimycotics) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90\u00d7g for 2\u2009min. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485\u00d7g for 8\u2009min, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham\u2019s F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cultured at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2. CAFs were then expanded into 10-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for three population doublings within total 7 to 10\u2009days after tis-sue dissociation. Primary cell cultures of fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence with human anti-vimentin (V9; 1:500) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy; 1:250). FAP\u03b1 antibody (H-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy; 1:500) was used to assess fibroblast activation (data not shown). We used CAFs passaged for up to 10 population doublings for the experiments, to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. All cell lines were grown in a 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and switched to medium without serum and phenol red the day before treatments to be processed for immunoblot and RT-PCR assays.Gene expression studies and PCR arraysTotal RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription as previously described. The expression of selected genes was quantified by real-time PCR using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and are as follows: 5\u2032-ACCTATGACCTGCTTGGTGC-3\u2032 (HIF-1\u03b1 forward) and 5\u2032-GGCTGTGTCGACTGAGGAAA-3\u2032 (HIF-1\u03b1 reverse); 5\u2032-TTAAAGCCCGCCTGACAGA-3\u2032 (IL-1\u03b2 forward) and 5\u2032-GCGAATGACAGAGGGTTTCTTAG-3\u2032 (IL-1\u03b2 reverse); 5\u2032-TTACAGAGGGAAAACGACACCT-3\u2032 (GPER forward) and 5\u2032-GTGGGTCTTCCTCAGAAGGG-3\u2032 (GPER reverse); 5\u2032-AGTCCCTGAGCATCTACGGT-3\u2032 (COX2 forward) and 5\u2032-CATCATCAGACCAGGCACCA-3\u2032 (COX2 reverse); 5\u2032-AAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTAA-3\u2032 (ACTB forward) and 5\u2032-CACCTCCCCTGTGTGGACTT-3\u2032 (ACTB reverse). Assays were performed in triplicate and the results were normalized for actin beta (ACTB) expression and then calculated as fold induction of RNA expression.PCR arrays were performed using a TaqMan\u2122 Human Tumor Metastasis Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The amplification reaction and the results analysis were carried out using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Gene silencing experiments and plasmidsCells were transfected using X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Merck Life Science) for 24\u2009h before treatments with a control vector and a specific shRNA sequence or antisense vector for each target gene. The short hairpin (sh) RNA constructs to knock down the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and the control shRNA construct were purchased form SABioscience Corporation. Antisense vector for GPER (AsGPER), which was generated by cloning of the entire open reading frame of the receptor cDNA in the reverse orientation in pcDNA3.1 Hygro (\u2212), was a kind gift from Eric R Prossnitz (University of New Mexico Health Science Center, Albuquerque, USA). The plasmid DN/c-fos, which encodes for c-fos mutant that heterodimerizes with c-fos dimerization partners but does not allow DNA binding, was a kind gift from Dr. C. Vinson (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCells were grown in 10-cm dishes, exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h, and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Merck Life Science) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF-1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1%SDS and 0.1\u2009mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primers used to amplify a region containing a HRE site located into the GPER promoter sequence were: 5\u2032-TGCAGCACTTCAAAACAATAACC \u2212\u20093\u2032 (Fw) and 5\u2032-GGGTTTGAGTTGTTTTTCCTTTGG-3\u2032 (Rv); the primers used to amplify a region containing a HRE site located into the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence were: 5\u2032-ACAGACAGGGAGGGCTATTG-3\u2032 (Fw) and 5\u2032-GGGCAAGGAGTAGCAAACTA-3\u2032 (Rv). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation and the results were reported as fold changes respect to nonspecific IgG.Western blot analysisCells were grown in 10-cm dishes, exposed to treatments, and then lysed as previously described. Equal amounts of whole-protein extract were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Sigma-Adrich, Milan, Italy), which were probed with primary antibodies (1:1000) against HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (R&D Systems, Bio-Techne, Milano, Italy), GPER (AB137479) (Abcam, DBA, Milan, Italy), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), p-AKT1/2/3 (Ser 473)-R, AKT/1/2/3 (H-136), c-fos (E-8) and \u03b2-actin (AC-15; 1:4000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy) and then revealed using the chemiluminescent substrate for western blotting Westar Nova 2.0 (Cyanagen, Biogenerica, Catania, Italy). For nuclear extracts, cells were lysed using 300\u2009\u03bcl of cytosolic buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES pH\u20097.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA, pH\u20097.5, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (1.7\u2009mg/ml aprotinin, 1\u2009mg/ml leupeptin, 200\u2009mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200\u2009mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate and 100\u2009mmol/liter sodium fluoride). Following centrifugation (14,000\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C, 10\u2009min), the supernatant was referred to as cytoplasmic fraction and the pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in high salt buffer (20\u2009mM HEPES pH\u20097.9, 25% [v:v] glycerol, 420\u2009mM NaCl, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2\u2009mM EDTA and protease inhibitors). For the extraction of nuclear proteins, the obtained solution was vortexed thoroughly, incubated overnight with agitation and centrifugated at 14000\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Equal amounts of the collected supernatant, which represent the nuclear fraction, were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis was performed as described above. The purity of the nuclear fraction was confirmed by immunoblotting with primary antibodies against \u03b2-actin (AC-15; 1:4000) and anti-LMNB/Lamin (M-20; 1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy).Co-immunoprecipitation assayAfter exposure to treatments, cells were washed and lysed using 500\u2009\u03bcl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors (1.7\u2009mg/ml aprotinin, 1\u2009mg/ml leupeptin, 200\u2009mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200\u2009mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate and 100\u2009mmol/liter sodium fluoride). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min and protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie (Bradford) protein assay. Proteins (200\u2009\u03bcg) were then incubated for 2\u2009h with 900\u2009\u03bcl of immunoprecipitation buffer with inhibitors, 2\u2009\u03bcg of anti-c-fos or anti-GPER antibodies and 20\u2009\u03bcl of Protein A/G agarose immunoprecipitation reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C to pellet beads. Pellets were washed four times with 500\u2009\u03bcl of PBS and centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected, resuspended in 20\u2009\u03bcl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors, 2X SDS sample buffer and heated to 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Samples were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with primary antibodies. Western blot analysis and ECL detection were performed as described above.Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on a cover slip, serum deprived for 18\u2009h and then exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h. Next, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed 3 times with PBS and incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight with a primary antibody (1:250) against GPER (AB137479) (Abcam, DBA, Milan, Italy) or Phospho-Myosin Light Chain 2 (Ser19) (p-MLC) (Cell Signaling, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS, probed with alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Phalloidin stainingCells were exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h, washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10\u2009min, washed briefly with PBS, then incubated with Phalloidin-Fluorescent Conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assayThe concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 in supernatants from hypoxia-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were measured using human IL-1\u03b2 ELISA Kit (Thermo Scientific, Monza Italy), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The plates were read at 450\u2009nm on a Microplate Spectrophotometer Epoch\u2122 (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).DCFDA fluorescence measurement of ROSThe non-fluorescent 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) probe was used to evaluate intracellular ROS production. Briefly, cells were incubated with 10\u2009\u03bcM DCFDA (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, washed with PBS, and then exposed to treatments for 15\u2009min, as indicated. Cells were then washed with PBS, and the images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Conditioned mediumMDA-MB-231 cells were cultured under normal or low oxygen tension (2%) for 16\u2009h. Thereafter, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 3500\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in the appropriate experiments.Cell spreading assayCells were treated for 16\u2009h, trypsinized and seeded onto fibronectin (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) coated 96-well plate at a density of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/ml and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Phase-contrast images were captured after 15\u2009min and 60\u2009min. As previously reported, round bright cells were considered unspread, whereas spread cells were defined as those cells that had lost their phase-bright appearance and had readily distinguishable nucleus and cytoplasm and quantified by counting six randomly selected fields in each well under a phase-contrast microscope.Invasion assayTranswell 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane (Costar, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was used to evaluate in vitro cell invasion. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcL serum-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber, coated with Corning\u00ae Matrigel\u00ae Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Basement Membrane Matrix (Biogenerica, Catania, Italy) (diluted with serum-free medium at a ratio of 1:3). For invasion assays in MDA-MB-231 cells, complete medium was added to the bottom chambers in the presence of treatments where required, then cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 16\u2009h. For invasion assays in CAFs, conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 cells previously exposed to hypoxia for 16\u2009h was added to the bottom chambers in the presence of treatments, where required. Cells on the upper surface of the membrane were then removed by wiping with Q-tip, and invaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), photographed using Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and counted using the WCIF ImageJ software.Spheroid formation assayFor spheroid generation, 100\u2009\u03bcL/well of MDA-MB 231 cell suspensions (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were dispensed into 2% agar-coated 24-well plates. Three days after seeding, tumor spheroids (a single spheroid per well) were exposed to treatments and a 50% medium and treatment replenishment was performed every 2\u2009days. Images were obtained on day 20 using a conventional inverted microscope, thereafter cell number per spheroid was determined by trypsinizing three different spheroids, mixing the cell suspension with trypan blue and counting the number of viable cells. The total number of cells obtained was divided by the number of trypsinized spheroids.Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls\u2019 test to determine differences in means. The bioinformatics analyses, including t-tests, box plots and scatter plots, were performed using the R tidyverse package (https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/). p\u2009<\u20090.05 and p\u2009<\u20090.01 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpression levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are correlated in TNBCa The \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d signaling is a prominent transduction pathway associated with the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients. The top 250 genes correlated with HIF-1\u03b1 in the TCGA dataset were clustered using the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The x-axis and the y-axis indicate respectively the \u2212log10-adjusted p-value and the different KEGG pathways. The number of the genes represented in the identified pathways is plotted on the right of each bar. The genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway (listed in the pink box) were ordered by their HIF-1\u03b1 correlation coefficients (from high to low) (see Additional file 1). b GSEA confirms an enrichment of the genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway in the TNBC patients with high HIF-1\u03b1 levels, as indicated. The patients of the TCGA and METABRIC datasets were ranked in accordance with the differential HIF-1\u03b1 expression levels. c GSEA reveals an enrichment of the \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d genes in the TNBC patients with high IL-1\u03b2 expression. Patients of the TCGA and METABRIC datasets were ranked in accordance with the differential IL-1\u03b2 expression levels. Enrichment scores (ES) and relative p-values are plotteda Scatter plots depicting the correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 expression and IL-1\u03b2 levels in TNBC patients of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and the relative p-values are shown in each panel. b Box plots showing the differential IL-1\u03b2 expression levels in non-TNBC and TNBC patients, as found in the TCGA and METABRIC datasets. The number of patients and p-values are reported in each panelIt is well acknowledged that the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 acts as a molecular sensor within the hypoxic breast tumor microenvironment toward aggressive cancer features. Hence, we began our study evaluating the gene signature associated with HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients that are characterized by a poor prognosis. Exploring the TCGA cohort of TNBC patients, the 250 genes mostly correlated with HIF-1\u03b1 were first ranked by Pearson correlation coefficient. In order to investigate the biological significance of these genes, KEGG pathway analysis was then performed using DAVID. The top 250 HIF-1\u03b1 correlated genes were enriched in a set of pathways, as schematically reported in Fig.\u00a01a. The \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d transduction pathway, including IL1B, IL1A, IL1R, IL6, IL6ST, IL7R, IL1RAP, INHBA, OSMR and TGFBR2 that are strongly associated with breast cancer progression, was found significantly correlated with HIF-1\u03b1. Next, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in order to explore the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d expression profile according to the high and low HIF-1\u03b1 phenotypes of both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts of TNBC patients. It is worth noting that the genes included in the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway were found enriched in the group of patients showing high HIF-1\u03b1 levels (Fig. 1b). As IL-1\u03b2 may contribute to breast cancer development and metastasis and may regulate the migratory phenotype of TNBC cells through HIF-1\u03b1, we sought to evaluate whether IL-1\u03b2 could be involved in the activation of a hypoxia-related gene signature in TNBC patients. In this regard, we ascertained that the genes included in the \u201cHIF-1 signaling pathway\u201d of the KEGG database are significantly enriched in the TNBC cohorts displaying high IL-1\u03b2 expression of both TCGA and METABRIC datasets (Fig. 1c). Further corroborating these observations, a positive correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and HIF-1\u03b1 levels was found in the TNBC cohorts of both databases (Fig.\u00a02a). Exploring the clinical significance of IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients, we assessed that the IL-1\u03b2 expression levels are significantly higher in TNBC compared to non-TNBC in both TCGA and METABRIC datasets (Fig. 2b). Overall, the aforementioned data suggests that IL-1\u03b2 is engaged by HIF-1\u03b1 toward the development of the aggressive TNBC. GPER is involved in the up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 mediated by HIF-1\u03b1 upon hypoxiaThe HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling is involved in the expression of IL-1\u03b2 induced by hypoxia. mRNA (a) and protein (b) expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 evaluated respectively by real-time PCR and immunoblotting in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells cultured upon normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2).

(*), (\u25cb) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured upon normoxia versus cells cultured upon hypoxiaOn the basis of the aforementioned findings and in order to provide novel insights on the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 by hypoxia in TNBC, we ascertained that a low oxygen tension (2% O2, thereafter mentioned as hypoxia) induces the mRNA (Fig.\u00a03a) and protein (Fig. 3b) expression of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, which are a well-recognized model system of TNBC. Upon hypoxic conditions, the mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03b1 did not display any change (Fig. 3a) whereas an increased protein expression was observed (Fig. 3b), in accordance with the known ability of hypoxia to decrease the HIF-1\u03b1 ubiquitination and degradation. Next, performing ELISA assays we determined that the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 increases in the medium of MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under hypoxia (Fig. 3c). Remarkably, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the expression of IL-1\u03b2 prompted by hypoxia, suggesting that HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in the up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxic conditions. In accordance with previous findings showing that HIF-1\u03b1 can be induced by proinflammatory stimuli including IL-1\u03b2, we ascertained that IL-1\u03b2 boosts the accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02). Worthy, these results suggest that the HIF-1\u03b1-dependent induction of IL-1\u03b2 upon hypoxic conditions may generate a feed-forward loop that further contributes to the stimulatory interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling. Reminiscing our previous data on the action of GPER in hypoxic conditions, we assessed that hypoxia triggers the up-regulation of GPER mRNA (Fig. 3e) and protein (Fig. 3f) levels in a time-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we then found that HIF-1\u03b1 is recruited to the GPER promoter region in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 3g). Moreover, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 prevented the protein induction of GPER upon a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3h), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia. Next, the hypoxia increased HIF-1\u03b1 levels were not altered by the silencing of GPER that instead abolished the induction of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 3i). Together, these findings suggest that upon hypoxia HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in the up-regulation of GPER, which then cooperates with HIF-1\u03b1 toward the regulation of IL-1\u03b2. In order to evaluate the transduction mechanism mediating the aforementioned responses, we first assessed that a short exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to hypoxia does increase the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig.\u00a04a), which are required for the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 and the subsequent transduction of the hypoxia-mediated signaling. In the aforementioned experimental condition, we next ascertained that the activation of two main transduction regulators of HIF-1\u03b1, namely ERK1/2 and Akt, is prevented in the presence of the ROS scavenger NAC (Fig. 4b). As c-fos expression is a suitable molecular sensor of both GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 transduction signaling, we also determined that the induction of c-fos protein levels observed upon a 4\u2009h exposure to hypoxia is no longer evident in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD, the PI3K inhibitor LY (Fig. 4c) and NAC (Fig. 4d). Likewise, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 protein levels upon a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxia using either NAC (Fig. 4e) or PD and LY (Fig. 4f), suggesting that the ROS activity triggers the ERK1/2/Akt/c-fos transduction signaling toward the hypoxic regulation of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 expression. In accordance with these findings, the transfection in MDA-MB-231 cells of a plasmid encoding a mutant of c-fos, namely dominant negative c-fos (DN/c-fos), abrogated the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 triggered by a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 4g). In order to evaluate whether the reduction of HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels triggered in the aforementioned experimental condition by the DN/c-fos construct is associated with the HIF-1\u03b1 proteasome-dependent degradation, the MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 16\u2009h with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Notably, the MG132 rescued the effects of the DN/c-fos construct on the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels (Fig. 4h), suggesting that c-fos is involved in the complex HIF-1\u03b1 biological regulation at the proteasomal level. By co-immunoprecipitation studies, we also found that hypoxia stimulates a direct interaction between c-fos and HIF-1\u03b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4i), indicating that the action of c-fos on HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization at least in part occurs through a physical interaction between these two factors. Considering that in our previous study the functional cooperation between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER triggered the expression of certain genes in hypoxic conditions, we first ascertained that HIF-1\u03b1 co-immunoprecipitates with GPER in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 4j). Thereafter, we evidenced the accumulation of GPER in the nuclear compartment of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia, as evidenced by both immunofluorescence (Fig. 4k) and subcellular fractionation studies (Fig. 4l). Intriguingly, by ChIP assays we then demonstrated that the exposure to hypoxia induces the recruitment of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER to a HRE site located within the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence (Fig. 4m). Overall, these data suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER may be stimulated by hypoxia toward the transcription of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Hypoxia triggers a functional cooperation among HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling toward a metastatic gene expression profile and invasive properties of TNBC cellsConsistent expression changes of metastasis-related genes are induced by hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, as evaluated by TaqMan\u2122 Human Tumor Metastasis Array. a MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured upon normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. b MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with vehicle or IL-1\u03b2 alone or in combination with IL1R1a.

(*) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured under normoxia versus cells cultured under hypoxia or cells treated with IL-1\u03b2 versus vehicle-treated cellsIn order to provide further insights into the metastatic gene expression profile triggered by hypoxia through the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis, we performed a TaqMan Gene Expression Assay, which consists of a Human Tumor Metastasis Array. In this vein, MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed for 16\u2009h either to hypoxic conditions (Fig.\u00a05a) or the recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5b), in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. Considering the genes resulting with at least a 0.25 log2 fold change upon either hypoxia respect to normoxia-exposed cells (Fig. 5a) or IL-1\u03b2 respect to vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5b), 31 and 15 metastatic genes induced respectively by hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 were identified (Fig.\u00a06a). Among the 11 genes up-regulated by either hypoxia or IL-1\u03b2 as depicted in the Venn diagram (Fig. 6a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a03), we then focused on the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and its target gene cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) considering that their strong increase was abrogated using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig.5a-b). First, we ascertained that a positive correlation does exist between IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 levels in TNBC patients of the METABRIC dataset (Fig. 6b). Thereafter, we confirmed by real-time and western blotting assays that the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a prevents the mRNA (Fig. 6c) and protein (Fig. 6d-e) expression of both IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 induced by a 16\u2009h exposure to either hypoxia or IL-1\u03b2 treatment, in accordance with previous evidence demonstrating that IL-1\u03b2 may auto-regulate its own production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the COX2 protein induction by a 16\u2009h hypoxic condition is prevented by silencing GPER (Fig. 6f), indicating that GPER is involved not only in the above described IL-1\u03b2 expression but also in the increase of COX2 upon hypoxia. The IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 system is involved in the invasive and proliferative features induced by hypoxia in MDA-MB-231 cells. a-b Cell spreading was evaluated in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with scramble or AsGPER and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) in the presence or absence of IL1R1a.

(*), (\u25cb), (\u25a1) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured under normoxia versus cells cultured under hypoxia or treated with IL-1\u03b2 versus vehicle-treated cellsA hypoxic environment may lower cell-ECM adhesion prompting cell motility and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition toward aggressive breast cancer phenotypes. Hence, we evaluated the contribution of GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 mediated signaling in the metastasis-related responses induced by the hypoxia-stimulated IL-1\u03b2 action. In this regard, we assessed that MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions exhibit a reduced spreading ability on fibronectin 60\u2009min after seeding respect to cells grown under normoxic conditions (Fig.\u00a07a-b). Notably, this effect was no longer evident silencing GPER as well as using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig. 7a-b). Results similar to those mentioned above were observed treating cells with IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 7c-d). Together, these findings suggest that both GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R axis contribute to hypoxia-decreased cancer cell spreading on the ECM protein fibronectin, according to previous data correlating the hypoxia-lowered cell-ECM adhesion to an increased invasion, intravasation and metastasis. Next, the invasive effects prompted by both hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 treatment were prevented not only by silencing GPER but also using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a, as evaluated by Transwell Matrigel invasion assays (Fig. 7e-f). Moreover, both GPER silencing and IL1R1a lessened the spheroid expansion upon hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 7g). Overall, these findings may suggest that the signaling network of both HIF-1\u03b1/GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R, may lead to an auto-regulatory loop of IL-1\u03b2 toward invasive and metastatic properties of hypoxic TNBC cells. The hypoxic regulation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling in TNBC cells promotes an invasive CAFs phenotypeThe paracrine action of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis promotes the actin-myosin contractility and the invasion of CAFs. a-b Immunoblots of IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 in CAFs exposed to conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells cultured upon normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) (a) and in CAFs treated with vehicle or IL-1\u03b2 (b), in the presence or absence of IL1R1a. c-d Phosphorylation of MLC in CAFs cultured with conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to normoxia and hypoxia (c) or IL-1\u03b2 (d), in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a.

(*) p\u2009<\u20090.05On the basis of the aforementioned findings, we sought to provide mechanistic insights into the paracrine IL-1\u03b2 feedback on important components of the tumor microenvironment as CAFs. In this vein, CAFs were cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells, which were exposed to hypoxia. Interestingly, the up-regulation of both IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 protein levels occurring in CAFs upon this experimental condition (Fig.\u00a08a) was prevented either using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig. 8a) or the neutralizing IL-1\u03b2 antibody (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04). Findings similar to those above mentioned were observed in CAFs treated with IL1\u03b2 (Fig. 8b). Considering that hypoxia may stimulate breast cancer cells toward invasive features as cell motility, formation of stress fibers and matrix contraction, the CM from MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia promoted in CAFs the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) on serine-19 (pMLCS19) (Fig. 8c), which is known to be required for the coordination of the actin-myosin contractility. In accordance with these results, an increased MLC phosphorylation was evidenced in CAFs treated with IL1\u03b2 (Fig. 8d). Moreover, immunofluorescent staining of polymerized actin (F-actin) using FITC-conjugated phalloidin revealed an augmented formation of stress fibers upon exposure of CAFs to the CM from hypoxia-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8e) as well as upon treatment with IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 8d). Notable, both pMLCS19 phosphorylation and the increased formation of actin stress fibers triggered in CAFs by the CM from hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8c, e) and IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 8d, f), were abolished in the presence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. Then, we observed that the invasion of CAFs promoted by the CM from hypoxia-exposed MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8g) or by IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 8h), was no longer evident in the presence of IL1R1a. Altogether, these results show that the IL-1\u03b2 production by the hypoxic TNBC cells may trigger a paracrine feed-forward signaling that stimulates malignant features in main components of the breast tumor microenvironment as CAFs. DiscussionIn the current study we have provided novel insights regarding the hypoxia-mediated regulation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 transduction signaling in TNBC cells and patient-derived breast CAFs. First, we assessed that the genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway are both associated with HIF-1\u03b1 expression in human TNBC samples and enriched in patients showing high HIF-1\u03b1 levels. Thereafter, we found that the genes included in the \u201cHIF-1 signaling pathway\u201d are enriched in the TNBC cohort displaying high levels of IL-1\u03b2, which is a main component of the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway. Next, we ascertained that IL-1\u03b2 expression is higher in TNBC respect to non-TNBC samples and correlates with HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients. Mechanistically, we then assessed that the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling is involved in the hypoxia-regulated action of IL-1\u03b2, which triggers both a metastatic gene signature and invasive features in TNBC cells. Focusing on the functional interaction that occurs between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma, we also determined that IL-1\u03b2 secreted by hypoxic TNBC cells may promote a feed-forward loop engaging its cognate receptor IL1R1 in breast CAFs. Corroborating these findings, we determined that the conditioned medium collected from TNBC cells exposed to hypoxia stimulates in CAFs the actin polymerization and the MLC phosphorylation, which characterize the attainment of invasive phenotypes.Intratumoral hypoxia, which is a common feature in solid cancers as breast cancer, is associated with an increased risk of metastatic aggressiveness and patient mortality. Of note, cancer cells can adapt to low oxygen tension activating the hypoxia-inducible factors that mainly drive a peculiar gene expression signature. As well-known, the master regulators of the cellular adaptation to hypoxia consist of the oxygen-regulated HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1 and HIF-3\u03b1 subunits and the constitutively expressed HIF-1\u03b2 subunit. The HIF-1\u03b1, 2\u03b1 and 3\u03b1 subunits are subjected to oxygen-dependent processes like prolyl hydroxylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which are inhibited upon hypoxia that triggers the post-translational stabilization and the HIF-\u03b1 protein accumulation. Subsequently, HIF-1\u03b1 binds to the hypoxia response elements regulating the transcription of genes implicated in critical aspects of cancer biology as angiogenesis, stem cell maintenance, metabolic reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis and resistance to therapy. Likewise, hypoxia-activated HIF-1\u03b1 plays a role in the tumor-related inflammation leading to worse clinical outcomes in diverse types of cancers including breast tumors. These events may occur through the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent regulation of signaling mediators and inflammatory genes in both cancer and neighboring cells within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the pro-tumorigenic action of HIF-1\u03b1 may occur through its interaction with various signaling pathways like transforming growth factor-\u03b2, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch and GPCRs. In this regard, GPER was shown to be involved together with HIF-1\u03b1 in the cell adaptation to low oxygen tension in diverse tumors as breast cancer. In particular, hypoxia-activated HIF-1\u03b1 was found to cooperate with GPER in breast cancer cells and CAFs toward gene expression changes and relevant biological responses. Intriguingly, GPER was also shown to trigger the activation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 transduction signaling, which in turn promoted inflammatory responses and aggressive features of breast cancer cells. Further corroborating these findings, we here demonstrate that a functional liaison between HIF-\u03b1 and GPER mediates the induction of IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC cells exposed to hypoxic conditions. In particular, we first evidenced that the up-regulation of GPER upon hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to a HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in TNBC cells. Then, we assessed that in hypoxic TNBC cells HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence. It is worth mentioning that many studies have demonstrated that GPER is detectable not only at the plasma membrane level, but also in the intracellular and nuclear compartments. As it concerns the signaling cascade triggering the aforementioned findings, we demonstrated that the ROS-dependent ERK1/2 and AKT activation together with the ensuing c-fos induction contribute to the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 as well as the up-regulation of GPER and IL-1\u03b2 in hypoxic TNBC cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays also revealed that c-fos both interacts directly and protects HIF-1\u03b1 from the proteasomal degradation.As largely reported, TNBC patients show an elevated incidence of metastatic processes and low survival rates. Unfortunately, TNBCs remain to be fully characterized toward the assessment of reliable prognostic markers and drug targets. Of note, \u201comics\u201d technologies have recently provided intriguing insights into the molecular landscape and the heterogeneous clinical features of TNBC, leading to the identification of potentially actionable targets. In this scenario, the HIF-dependent signaling has been reported to be particularly active in TNBCs, suggesting that hypoxia may play a relevant role toward the peculiar features of TNBCs. Likewise, it has been ascertained that the tumor-stroma inflammation network may prompt the pro-metastatic phenotypes in TNBCs. In this regard, it should be mentioned that IL-1\u03b2 acts as an important effector of the oncogene-driven pathways linking inflammation to cancer. Indeed, IL-1\u03b2 is considered as a master cytokine in the progression of breast cancer as its production has been found correlated with advanced diseases, whereas the IL1R1 inhibition by the antagonist anakinra was shown to prevent the growth of breast cancer and the bone metastasis in mouse models. Further corroborating these data, IL-1\u03b2 was found to contribute to the hypoxia-mediated angiogenesis through the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1. In the framework of these findings, we have here provided novel evidence regarding the hypoxic-induced IL-1\u03b2 expression and function toward the metastasis-related gene profile as well as the growth and invasive properties of TNBC cells.COX2 is the key enzyme in eicosanoid biosynthesis and the master switch in the activation of the inflammatory responses. The induction of COX2 by inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, triggers the biosynthesis of prostaglandins from the arachidonic acid, which is a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid released from membrane phospholipids upon the phospholipase A2 action. Worthy, the constitutive expression of COX2 and the sustained biosynthesis of the main effector of inflammation named prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), are both linked to mammary carcinogenesis due to their stimulatory effects on mitogenesis, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis and immunosuppression. In addition, the overexpression of COX2 may occur in approximately 50% of breast cancer and has been found correlated with a reduced disease-free and overall survival and the primary tumor size. Of note, in line with our findings regarding the hypoxia-dependent activation of the IL-1\u03b2/COX2 signaling toward the stimulation of growth and invasion of TNBC cells, previous studies have shown that the MDA-MB-231 cells display a lipidomic profile characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are known to contribute to breast cancer progression, as mentioned above.In the breast cancer microenvironment, the bidirectional interplay occurring among neoplastic cells with CAFs, tumor-associated macrophages, endothelial and immune infiltrating cells, endorses tumor progression stimulating responses as cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. In particular, CAFs may facilitate the establishment of a conducive microenvironmental niche for the cruitment and maintenance of disseminated tumor initiating cells. Likewise, CAFs may regulate the malignant features fostering the proliferative, migratory and invasive potential of surrounding tumor cells. In this respect, IL-1\u03b2 was involved in the connection between breast cancer cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are considered an additional source of CAFs beyond the fibroblasts. Worthy, the IL-1\u03b2-dictated cellular interaction stimulated the production of diverse chemokines by MSCs as well as an increased motility of TNBC cells. Nicely reminiscing these observations, we have here demonstrated that hypoxic TNBC cells trigger IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 paracrine signals that prompt certain cytoskeletal changes as the MLC-driven formation of actin stress fibers toward invasive properties of breast CAFs. Overall, our data provide novel evidence regarding the mechanisms through which hypoxia triggers the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling, which generates a feed-forward stimulatory loop in both TNBC cells and CAFs. Our findings may be therefore considered in more comprehensive therapeutic strategies targeting breast cancer progression.ConclusionsOur data provide novel evidence regarding the molecular mechanisms through which the IL1\u03b2-IL1R signaling does prompt stimulatory effects upon hypoxia in TNBC cells and CAFs. Considering the intricate interplay occurring among diverse players activated by hypoxia even through feed-forward loops, further efforts are warranted to better appreciate this complex scenario toward more comprehensive therapeutic strategies halting the aggressive features of the TNBC.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsACTBActin betaCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsCOX2Cyclooxygenase 2DAVIDDatabase for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated DiscoveryECMExtracellular matrix componentsEREstrogen receptorGPCRsG protein-coupled receptorsGPERG protein estrogen receptorGSEAGene Set Enrichment AnalysisHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2HIF-1\u03b1Hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1IL-\u03b2Interleukin-1\u03b2IL1R1Interleukin 1 Receptor Type 1IL1R1aIL1R1 antagonistKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesMETABRICMolecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International ConsortiumNACN-acetyl-L-cysteinePRProgesterone receptorROSReactive oxygen speciesTCGAThe Cancer Genome AtlasTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerVEGFVascular endothelial growth factorPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Rosamaria Lappano and Marianna Talia contributed equally to this work.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s13046-020-01667-y.Authors\u2019 contributionsRL and MM conceived the study, analyzed and interpreted the data.

        "content": "The tumor microenvironment plays pivotal roles in promotion of many malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been well-known to promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis but mechanistic understanding of tumor-stroma interactions is not yet complete. Recently, estrogen synthetic enzymes were reported to be upregulated by co-culture with stromal cells in ER positive breast carcinoma (BC) but effects of co-culture on androgen metabolism have not been extensively examined. Therefore, we evaluated roles of CAFs on androgen metabolism in ER-negative AR-positive BC through co-culture with CAFs. Concentrations of steroid hormone in supernatant of co-culture of MDA-MB-453 and primary CAFs were measured using GC-MS. Cytokines derived from CAFs were determined using Cytokine Array. Expressions of androgen synthetic enzymes were confirmed using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Correlations between CAFs and androgen synthetic enzymes were analyzed using triple-negative BC (TNBC) patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. CAFs were demonstrated to increase expressions and activities of 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1. IL-6 and HGF that were selected as potential paracrine mediators using cytokine array induced 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1 expression. Underlying mechanisms of IL-6 paracrine regulation of 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 could be partially dependent on phosphorylated STAT3, while phosphorylated ERK could be involved in HGF-mediated 5\u03b1-Reductase1 induction. \u03b1-SMA status was also demonstrated to be significantly correlated with 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 status in TNBC tissues, especially AR-positive cases. Results of our present study suggest that both IL-6 and HGF derived from CAFs could contribute to the intratumoral androgen metabolism in ER-negative BC patients.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumour initiation and progression, possibly by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a series of cellular changes that is known to underlie the process of metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether CAFs and surrounding normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) are able to induce EMT markers and functional changes in breast epithelial cancer cells. Matched pairs of CAFs and NBFs were established from fresh human breast cancer specimens and characterised by assessment of CXCL12 levels, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels and response to doxorubicin. The fibroblasts were then co-cultured with MCF7 cells. Vimentin and E-cadherin expressions were determined in co-cultured MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as by western blotting and quantitative PCR. Co-cultured MCF7 cells were also assessed functionally by invasion assay. CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and expressed higher levels of \u03b1-SMA compared with NBFs. CAFs were also less sensitive to doxorubicin as evidenced by less H2AX phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis on flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V compared with NBFs. When co-cultured with MCF7 cells, there was greater vimentin and less E-cadherin expression as well as greater invasiveness in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CAFs compared with those co-cultured with NBFs. CAFs have the ability to induce a greater degree of EMT in MCF7 cell lines, indicating that CAFs contribute to a more malignant breast cancer phenotype and their role in influencing therapy resistance should therefore be considered when treating breast cancer.",

Even though it has been shown that CAFs support tumor growth, not much is known about how they contribute to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer (BC).Tumor stromal cells may secrete paracrine factors, which can affect the distinct layers of the neoplastic population, resulting in phenotypic and signaling pathway alterations throughout the tumor cohort.CAFs take a crucial part in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment in BC by recruiting monocytes and affecting their polarization states.Our findings propose that exosomal transfer of miR-18a1 may be a novel mechanism underlying the paracrine effects of tumor-educated monocytes and may provide a way for exosomes to promote tumor progression within the microenvironment of BC cells.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-022-03780-2.BackgroundThe tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and continuously evolving entity composed of stromal cells, immune cells, and blood vessels arranged in the extracellular matrix. The reciprocal and dynamic crosstalk between the TME components and tumor cells contributes to tumorigenesis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are a prominent part of the tumor stroma, not only provide physical support for tumor cells to promote tumor growth and progression, but they also contribute to an immunosuppressive TME by affecting many immune cells. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which originate from circulating monocyte precursors, are the most abundant immune cell type in close proximity to the CAF-populated areas, indicating a close association between these two major cell populations in the stroma of tumors, where they often exert protumorigenic functions.Cancer locally educates TAMs to distinguish them from monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages. The mutual interactions with tumor cells and the stromal microenvironment contribute to the phenotypic polarization of TAMs. The M1/M2 polarization of macrophages is endowed with a repertoire of tumor-promoting capabilities involving tumor growth and metastasis, tissue remodeling, and immunosuppression. Breast cancer (BC) is characterized by having a large population of TAMs, most of which exhibit the M2 phenotype. Both CAFs and TAMs support tumor progression and an increased number of either is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. CAFs and TAMs do more than just reciprocal communication with the tumor cells; they also interact with each other in a dynamic way in the tumor milieu. Numerous studies have indicated that CAFs play a crucial role in monocyte recruitment and M2 polarization in different types of tumors, such as BC. Investigating TME-induced macrophage polarization and communication between TAMs and tumor cells is crucial for further understanding of TAM-related pro-tumor outcomes and the potential development of novel therapeutic strategies.Exosomes, a subclass of membrane-derived extracellular vesicles with a size range of 30\u2013150\u00a0nm in diameter, are produced and released by all types of cells into the extracellular milieu. Exosome-mediated transfer of functional coding and non-coding RNAs is a mechanism of genetic exchange between cells in the TME, thereby affecting tumor development and progression. However, the function of TAM-derived exosomes in the BC-immunosuppressive microenvironment remains to be clarified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are a class of non-coding, endogenous, small RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by inducing degradation or translational repression of target mRNAs. From a therapeutic intervention perspective, intercellular communications mediated by exosomal miRNAs are attracting increasing attention due to their contributions to tumor progression by reprogramming the TME.There is little known about the functional effects of the exosome-mediated transfer of miRNAs released from tumoral monocytes on BC pathogenesis. In this study, we first elucidated that CAFs obtained from invasive BC recruited monocytes and induced an M2-like pro-tumoral phenotype, promoting BC progression. Next, we aimed to shed light on the mechanism by which the exosome-mediated transfer of miR-181a secreted by CAF-educated monocytes activates AKT signaling in BC cells.Materials and methodsClinical samples and processingThe peripheral blood samples from 40 invasive breast ductal carcinoma patients who had not received any chemotherapeutic treatment before surgery were collected in the study. A cohort of 35 age-matched healthy control women with no evidence of any personal or family history of BC participated in this study. A record of the clinicopathological parameters of BC patients is summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1. To harvest the plasma samples, around 5\u00a0mL of blood samples from each participant were centrifuged at 3000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and then stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C until use. To isolate the stromal fibroblasts, primary cancer tissues were obtained from three female BC patients with histological grade III invasive ductal carcinoma who had undergone mastectomy. Normal breast tissues were obtained from three healthy women undergoing reduction mammoplasty. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tarbiat Modares University and written informed consent was obtained from the participants.Isolation, characterization, and culture of primary fibroblastsFibroblasts were isolated enzymatically from both normal and cancerous breast tissues using collagenase A as previously described and were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Immunophenotyping of patient-derived CAFs was performed for positive expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), fibroblast-activation protein (FAP), and negative expression of CD31 to exclude endothelial cell contamination using flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). To prepare the conditioned media (CM) of cancerous and normal cultured fibroblasts (CAF- and NF-CM, respectively) for monocyte treatments, stromal fibroblasts derived from tissue specimens were passaged 4\u20136 times. The expressions of CAF markers (\u03b1-SMA and FAP) and CAF-derived cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 as were also measured by western blotting over the course of passaging the cells. When fibroblasts reached a confluency of >\u200980%, the cells were serum starved. After 48\u00a0h, the CM were collected, pooled, and centrifuged at 300\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min and then further centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 30\u00a0min to eliminate residual cells and cellular debris, respectively.Monocyte isolation and characterizationLow-density mononuclear cells were first separated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient. CD14+ monocytes were isolated using a magnetic bead-based positive selection system (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) with a purity of >\u200990%, as confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. CD14+ monocytes were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS alone as control monocytes or were educated with CM derived from CAFs or NFs (CM:RPMI, 1:1) for 7\u00a0days. Cultured monocytes were stained with antibodies against CD163, CD206, PD1, CD14, as well as HLA-DR and then analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences).T-cell isolation and expansionPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy individuals\u2019 peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient separation. The isolated PBMCs were then cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Subsequently, the adherent cells were removed and T-cells were isolated by nylon wool columns. T-cells were stimulated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and expanded in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 7\u201310\u00a0days.Cell culturesThe human BC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted FBS. The human monocyte cell line THP-1 was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS. All cells were cultured with 100\u00a0U/mL penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL streptomycin at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The monocytic THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by 24\u00a0h incubation with 150\u00a0nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI medium. Macrophage M2 polarization was obtained by incubation of THP-1 M0 macrophages with 20\u00a0ng/mL of interleukin (IL)-4 for 48\u00a0h.Isolation and characterization of exosomesExosomes were isolated from the supernatant of monocytes educated with the CM derived from CAFs or NFs by differential centrifugation as we previously described. Briefly, monocytes were maintained in bovine serum albumin (BSA) or serum-free medium 48\u00a0h before supernatant collection. The cell culture supernatants were collected, and centrifuged at 300\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min to eliminate residual cells and at 10,000\u00d7g for 30\u00a0min to further remove cells and debris. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter to remove any vesicles larger than 200\u00a0nm. The filtered supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000\u00d7g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. To further eliminate contaminating protein, the exosome pellet was re-suspended in PBS and centrifuged again at 100,000\u00d7g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Finally, the exosome-enriched pellets were re-suspended in PBS and stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C until use.The quantity of exosomes was expressed as exosome-associated proteins using the BCA method. Exosome-specific surface markers CD9 and CD81 were detected by western blotting as we previously described. The morphology of exosomes was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, LEO 906 Zeiss 100\u00a0kV, Germany). The size distribution of the purified exosomes was also determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instrument, UK).Cellular uptake of purified exosomesFluorescent labeling of purified exosomes was performed using a PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with some modifications. The labeled exosomes were added to a subconfluent layer of BC cells and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h. Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For nuclear staining, DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma-Aldrich) was used. The uptake of exosomes was imaged using a spectral confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse TiE).CFSE proliferation assayTo assess the effects of CAF- or NF-educated monocytes on T lymphocyte proliferation, T-cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and were co-cultured with either control monocytes or with monocytes educated with CAFs or NFs. In parallel, T-cells were incubated with exosomes derived from NFs or CAFs. After 72\u00a0h, the proliferation of CFSE-labeled T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry and compared to the control T-cells.Transient transfectionBC cells were transiently transfected with 25\u00a0nM miR-181a mimic or negative controls (NC); miR-181a inhibitor or scramble (Sc) using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 (Invitrogen, USA). To perform a luciferase reporter assay, BC were transfected with 2\u00a0\u00b5g of the psi-CHECK2 luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). Then, luciferase-expressing BC cells were co-cultured with monocytes and were maintained in the control medium, NF-CM, or CAF-CM. After 24\u00a0h, cell lysate was collected and added into a 96-well plate. The luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA).Cell cycle analysisBC cells were transfected with miR-181a mimic, miR-181a inhibitor, or the corresponding negative controls as described above. Additionally, another group of BC cells was treated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from CAFs or NFs. After 36\u00a0h, BC cells were harvested, treated with Triton X100 and RNase A, and then stained with propidium iodide (PI, Sigma). Afterward, cell cycle distribution was analyzed via a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Cell migration assaysA confluent monolayer of serum-starved BC cells plated into a 12-well plate was subjected to a single-scratch wound by using a sterile pipette tip. The cells were incubated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from control monocytes, NEMo, or TEMo and compared to PBS-treated control cells. The cell migration distance was measured and imaged. A cell transwell assay was also performed using 24-well transwells (Corning, USA). The corresponding treated or transfected cells were seeded into the upper chambers in 100\u00a0\u00b5L of FBS-free medium. As a chemoattractant, the medium with 10% FBS was added to the bottom part of the chambers. Cells were fixed and stained using 1% crystal violet dissolved in methanol 24\u00a0h after incubation. The cells that migrated through the membrane and stuck to the lower surface of the membrane were imaged and counted.Determination of intracellular reactive oxygen species productionThe intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production levels were measured by adding the 2\u2032, 7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (ab113851, Abcam) to the cell suspension according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The fluorescent intensity was measured by flow cytometry (BD FACS Canto II, BD Bioscience) and analyzed by FlowJo Software 7.6.2.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaysQuantitative measurements of secreted IL-10 and IL-12 cytokines were performed on the culture supernatants of THP-1 M0 macrophages, M2 macrophages (serve as positive control), and NF- or CAF-educated M2 macrophages for 48\u00a0h, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All cell culture supernatants were used undiluted.In silico analysis for prediction of miR-181a candidate target genesIn order to predict the potential targets of miR-181a, we used TargetScan 8.0 (http://www.targetscan.org), miRTargetLink Human (https://ccb-web.cs.uni-saarland.de/mirtargetlink) and RNAhybrid (https://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid) online tools. The DNA Intelligent Analysis (DIANA)-miRPath v3.0 (http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools) algorithm was used to show the miRNA regulatory roles and to find the significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) molecular pathways.RNA extraction and reverse transcription quantitative PCRTotal RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation and treated with RNase-free DNase (Fermentase, Lithuania). RNA was then reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the PrimeScript 1st strand cDNA synthesis kit (TAKARA, Japan). To quantify miRNA, a poly(A) tail was initially added to the extracted total RNA by using polyA polymerase enzyme (NEB), and cDNA was then synthesized by using an anchored oligo (dT) primer as described previously. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted on an ABI Step One Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The relative expression was normalized to U48 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and GAPDH using the 2\u2212\u0394Ct and 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct methods.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted from the cells or exosomes using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. For membrane blocking, 5% skim milk was used for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. The primary antibody incubation was performed for 12\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and then followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody incubation for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. The membranes were subjected to chemiluminescence using an ECL Kit (Amersham, UK). \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control.In vivo tumor xenograft modelAll animal experimental procedures were approved by the Committee for Animal Research of the University. A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 MDA-MB-231 BC cells alone or mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes (derived from TEMo or NEMo) were suspended in 100\u00a0\u00b5L serum-free DMEM and matrigel (1:1 ratio) and were subcutaneously injected into the oxter of 6-week old female BALB/C athymic nude mice. Tumor volume was monitored at every 7-day interval. The tumor volume was calculated using the formula: V (mm3)\u2009=\u2009(L\u2009\u00d7\u2009W2)/2. After 4\u00a0weeks, the mice were sacrificed to evaluate tumor growth.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistryFormalin-fixed tumor tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut into thin sections. The tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard procedures. For immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, tissue sections were dewaxed with xylene and then rehydrated in graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed by microwave heating in sodium citrate buffer at pH 6.0. To block endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were immersed in 3% H2O2 for 30\u00a0min. The sections were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies against \u03b1-SMA (ab7817, Abcam) and Ki-67 (sc-23900, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. After washing, the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h, and reactive products were visualized by staining with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB). The images were captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus CKX41, Japan) with appropriate magnification.Statistical analysisData are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) of at least three experiments. Statistical significance was calculated by Student\u2019s t-test when comparing two groups or by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) when comparing three or more groups. A p-value of\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsPrimary CAFs recruit monocytes and induce a pro-tumoral phenotype resembling M2 macrophagesStromal fibroblasts isolated from BC tissues exhibit characteristics of CAFs, effectively recruit monocytes and subsequently affect their polarization states. A Representative photomicrographs of H&E staining and IHC staining of \u03b1-SMA (a CAF-specific marker) and Ki67 (a proliferation marker) positive cells in breast tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues (\u00d7100). Immunohistochemically, the presence of \u03b1-SMA demonstrated the presence of stromal myofibroblasts surrounding the cancer nests, which were distributed among the invasive cancer cells in the heterogeneous cancer tissue. B A schematic illustration of primary CAF isolation and expansion in vitro. C Flow cytometry staining of primary cultured CAFs with anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-FAP, and anti-CD31. CAFs were characterized by the expression of \u03b1-SMA and FAP but lacked the expression of endothelial cell marker CD31 by flow cytometry. D, E To elucidate that monocytes are functionally recruited by CAFs, serum-starved monocytes were allowed to migrate for 12\u00a0h toward CMs from CAFs or NFs and compared to the negative control. D Representative photomicrographs of the migration potential of monocytes in different conditions assessed using the transwell assay. E Quantitative assessment of migrated cells showed that monocytes were effectively recruited by CAF-CM. Representative flow cytometry histograms (F) and bar graphs of mean fluorescent intensity (G) show that the expression levels of CD163, CD206, and PD-1 were considerably higher in TEMo than in NEMo or control monocytes, while the expression levels of HLA-DR and CD14 were significantly lower in TEMo compared to NEMo. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. *P-value\u2009<\u20090.05, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001To investigate the relationship between CAFs and the malignance phenotype, we first studied the expression of \u03b1-SMA (a myoepithelial cell marker) and Ki67 (a marker of proliferating cells) in tumor and non-tumor tissues obtained from BC patients. IHC assay performed on tissue samples confirmed that \u03b1-SMA is localized, particularly in adjacent stromal cells, which are mainly comprised of stromal myofibroblasts. Results also indicated that the expression of \u03b1-SMA has a significant association with histopathological grade (Fig.\u00a01A). As CAFs appear to be major tumor microenvironment components facilitating tumor progression, we aimed to clarify the function of CAFs isolated from patients who have been diagnosed with advanced grade tumors. To this end, CAFs were isolated from three primary BC tissues (Grade III) obtained from patients undergoing mastectomy (Fig.\u00a01B). As healthy counterparts, we used normal fibroblasts (NFs) isolated from normal breast tissues obtained from patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty. Primary cultures of both of those isolated fibroblasts were established. The evaluation of cell surface markers by flow cytometry indicated the positive expression of \u03b1-SMA and FAP but the lack of expression of vessel marker CD31 in isolated CAFs (Fig.\u00a01C). Additionally, western blot analysis revealed the expression of CAF-specific markers (\u03b1-SMA and FAP) and CAF-derived cytokines (IL-6, and TGF-\u03b2) over the course of passaging, confirming CAF activation status throughout the experiments (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).Stromal cells have been demonstrated to affect monocyte recruitment and polarization in addition to altering their functions in the TME. To evaluate whether CAFs recruit monocytes, we isolated monocytes from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and performed transwell migration assays. The bottom chambers contained conditioned media (CM) collected from CAFs and NFs, thus serving as chemoattractants. We observed that monocytes migrate toward CAF-CM in the bottom chambers, suggesting that CAFs may effectively recruit monocytes (Fig.\u00a01D, E). Additionally, to explore whether CAFs were able to induce a pro-tumoral phenotype in monocytes, CD14+ cells isolated from healthy individuals were subjected to differentiation following treatment with CAF-CM. Hereafter, monocytes educated by CM derived from tumoral CAFs are denoted as tumor-educated monocytes or TEMo, and monocytes co-cultured with CM derived from NFs are referred to as normal fibroblast-educated monocytes or NEMo. After 7\u00a0days of culture, the expression M2 macrophage markers CD163 and CD206 were higher in TEMo than in NEMo. In addition, the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was higher in TEMo than in NEMo. In fact, NF-educated cells\u2019 expressions of PD-1, CD163, and CD206 were similar to control monocytes. On the other hand, the expression of CD14 was much higher in NEMo than in TEMo. In addition, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR) expression of TEMo is much lower than that of NF-educated cells (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01F, G). All of these results suggest that CAFs may recruit monocytes and affect their polarization states.CAFs promote THP-1 polarization into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophagesCAFs induce the polarization of THP-1 cells into anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages. A After 24\u00a0h of incubation with 150\u00a0nM PMA, the monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation was confirmed by the elevated transcript levels of recognized macrophage markers CD36, CD68, and CD71. The decreased transcript level of CD14 in PMA-treated THP-1 cells further confirmed that the THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophage-like cells. B Transcript expression levels of M2 macrophage markers CD163 and CD206 in THP-1 macrophages incubated with CAF-CM were significantly increased compared with those in THP-1 M0 macrophages alone or incubated with NF-CM after 48\u00a0h. As a positive control, THP-1 macrophages were stimulated with 20\u00a0ng/mL of IL-4 for 48\u00a0h. C Protein secretion levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 were assessed by ELISA. THP-1 macrophages incubated with CAF-CM as well as positive control M2 macrophages were identified by IL-10high IL-12low phenotype when compared to THP-1 M0 macrophages alone or incubated with NF-CM, confirming the potential of CAFs in promoting the polarization of THP-1 cells into anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages after 48\u00a0h. D, E The relative levels of intracellular ROS production during macrophage polarization. The amount of ROS produced by differentiated THP-1 macrophages increased noticeably when monocytes were treated with PMA. Importantly, ROS generation in CAF-educated macrophages was lower than that in macrophages educated by NF-CM after 48\u00a0h. Even though the level of ROS diminishes during M1/M2 polarization, CAF-induced M2-like macrophages were found to produce higher levels of ROS than THP-1 control monocytes. Representative flow cytometry histograms (D) and bar graphs of relative DCFDA fluorescence intensity (E) imply that CAFs contribute to M2 polarization in part by increasing ROS production, as M2 macrophages require a level of ROS for proper polarization. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. ns: non-significant, *P-value\u2009<\u20090.05, **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001To explore the capability of CAF to induce M2 polarization of macrophages, the human monocyte cell line THP-1 was differentiated into macrophages by incubation in the presence of 150\u00a0nM PMA. After 24\u00a0h, cells became adherent and displayed an irregular cell shape characteristic of cells undergoing differentiation. As shown in Fig.\u00a02A, qRT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of recognized macrophage markers CD36, CD68, and CD71 were found to be higher as the macrophages differentiated (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The expression of CD14 was also decreased (P\u2009<\u20090.001), further confirming the monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation (Fig.\u00a02A). Afterward, THP-1 M0 macrophages were incubated with either CAF- or NF-CM and compared to positive control cells (i.e., THP-1 M0 macrophages stimulated with 20\u00a0ng/mL of IL-4 for 48\u00a0h). The M2 polarization of macrophages was assessed by studying the transcript and protein levels of several M2 macrophage markers. After 48\u00a0h of incubation, the transcript levels of CD163 (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and CD206 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) were found to be significantly increased in CAF-CM-incubated THP-1 macrophages (Fig.\u00a02B). Consistently, protein secretion level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased in culture supernatants of CAF-educated macrophages (P\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas protein secretion level of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 was found to be decreased in macrophages incubated with CAF-CM (P\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a02C). These findings shed light on the potential of CAFs in promoting THP-1 polarization into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages.Additionally, as it was demonstrated that oxidative stress plays a role in modulating macrophage phenotype, we aimed to determine ROS status during macrophage polarization. Data showed that when monocytes were incubated with PMA, ROS production in differentiated THP-1 macrophages was markedly elevated (P\u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a02D, E). Importantly, following CAF-CM incubation, ROS production was abolished in M2-like macrophages (P\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a02D, E). Even though ROS levels dropped during M1/M2 macrophage polarization, CAF-induced M2-like macrophages still seem to produce more ROS than THP-1 control monocytes (P\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a02D, E). Overall, these findings suggest that CAFs contribute to M2 polarization in part by increasing ROS production in monocytes, as M2 macrophages require a level of ROS for proper polarization.Isolation, characterization, and cellular uptake of exosomes derived from monocytesCharacterization and cellular uptake of purified exosomes derived from monocytes. The morphology and size of exosomes were observed using (A) transmission electron microscopy. B Representative dynamic light scattering (DLS) number distribution measurement of purified exosomes showed a single peak at\u2009~\u200990\u00a0nm. C Exosome-specific surface markers CD9 and CD81 were detected in exosomes by western blotting. The cytoplasmic protein marker Calnexin was expressed in the whole cell lysate but was undetectable in the isolated exosomes, indicating that the exosome preparations were not contaminated with other vesicles such as endoplasmic reticulum ones. D Cellular internalization of PKH26-labeled exosomes by MDA-MB-231 BC cells was visualized and imaged under a confocal microscope. The red fluorescence in the cytoplasm showed that exosomes were uptaken by MDA-MB-231 BC cells. The nuclear staining was performed by DAPITo uncover the paracrine effect of exosomes derived from CAF-educated monocytes on BC cells, we first isolated and purified exosomes from the conditioned media of monocytes educated with CAF or NF. The morphologically round and spherical shapes of purified exosomes with an approximate diameter ranging from ~\u200950\u2013150\u00a0nm were observed by TEM (Fig.\u00a03A). Also, the particle size distribution of exosomes by DLS revealed a single bell-shaped size distribution with a peak at ~\u200990\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a03B). Additionally, western blotting demonstrated that the exosome-specific tetraspanin markers CD9 and CD81 were enriched in the exosome preparation but not in the monocyte lysate. Conversely, the negative maker of Calnexin (the endoplasmic reticulum protein marker) was almost undetectable in the isolated exosomes, but highly expressed in cells (Fig.\u00a03C). To examine whether the monocyte-derived exosomes could be taken up by BC cells, PKH26-labeled exosomes were incubated with sub-confluent MDA-MB-231 BC cells for 18\u00a0h. Confocal microscopy imaging showed that monocyte exosomes can be incorporated and internalized into the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 BC cells (Fig.\u00a03D).CAF-educated monocytes and their derived exosomes exert immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting T-cell proliferationCAF-educated monocytes and their derived exosomes suppress T-cell proliferation. TEMo, NEMo, their corresponding exosomes as well as control monocytes were co-cultured with autologous peripheral T-cells which were labeled with CFSE for 72\u00a0h. Representative flow cytometry histograms (A) and bar graphs of proliferated T-cells (B) illustrated that TEMo and their derived exosomes (100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) had a greater inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation when compared with control monocytes, NEMo, or derived exosomes. Effector cells (i.e., monocytes) were co-cultured with target cells (labeled T-cells) at the Effector: target (E:T) ratio of 1:4. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001CAFs are found to be a major cause of immunosuppression, partly through disrupting T-cell function in the tumor microenvironment. First, in order to explore the functional role of CAF-educated monocytes (TEMo) in promoting immunosuppression, human autologous peripheral T lymphocytes were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and co-cultured with control monocytes, NEMo, or TEMo. After 72\u00a0h, flow cytometry data showed that T-cell proliferation was inhibited by TEMo more markedly than control (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and NEMo (P\u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a04). Importantly, we found that 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from TEMO (TEMo-Exo) had a similar inhibitory effect on the proliferation of T-cells compared to that of cells co-cultured with control monocytes or treated with exosomes derived from NEMo (NEMo-Exo) (P\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a04). These data suggest that CAFs could exert their immunosuppressive effects on T-cells, at least in part and indirectly, through educating monocytes.CAF-activated monocytes lose their anti-tumoral functions and exhibit an M2 pro-tumoral phenotype, promoting BC cell proliferationCAF-activated, polarized monocytes lose their tumoricidal properties and their derived exosomes enhance the proliferation and migration of BC cells and up-regulate the expression of EMT markers. A The cytotoxic activity of monocytes alone or incubated with either CAF- or NF-CM was evaluated by measuring the luciferase activity of MDA-MB-231 BC cells expressing luciferase (MDA-MB-231-luc) in a co-culture condition. Bar graphs represent the relative luciferase activity, indicative of BC viability. The reduced luciferase activity of BC cells co-cultured with control monocytes pointed to the effective anti-tumoral functions of monocytes. In contrast, when monocytes were treated with CAF-CM, these cells lost their tumoricidal properties and instead promoted BC proliferation. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01. B MDA-MB-231 BC cells were incubated with exosomes derived from all differentiated monocytes. Results showed that different concentrations of TEMo-Exo (25, 50, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) have promoting effects on the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 BC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, BC cell proliferation was not substantially affected by incubation with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL NEMo-Exo as compared to PBS-treated BC cells. As expected, BC cells displayed the lowest rate of proliferation when incubated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL control monocyte exosomes at the indicated time points. Points, mean of three different experiments, bars, SD. ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001. C Representative photomicrographs of MDA-MB-231 BC cells cultured with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL exosomes derived from TEMo, NEMo, or control monocytes as well as in standard medium containing PBS at 24\u00a0h after scratch wounding. BC cells incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo exhibited a considerably higher migration potential compared with those incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NEMo. D, E Enhanced migration of MDA-MB-231 BC cells incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of TEMo-Exo, compared with the corresponding control cells. D Representative photomicrographs of the migration potential of MDA-MB-231 BC cells in different conditions after 24\u00a0h of incubation, assessed using the transwell assay. E Quantitative assessment of migrated cells showed that MDA-MB-231 BC cells treated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo exhibited a significantly higher migration potential compared with cells incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NEMo as well as cells cultured in standard medium containing PBS. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001. F Western blot analysis showed up-regulation of EMT protein markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail) and down-regulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 BC cells, 48\u00a0h after treatment with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo compared with the corresponding control cells. Actin was used as an endogenous loading control. Western blot images are representative of at least three independent experimentsM2 macrophages are typically pro-tumoral and lack the tumoricidal properties of M1 macrophages. Because CAF-CM was able to induce the up-regulation of M2-specific markers, suggesting a conversion of naive monocytes into M2 macrophages (Fig.\u00a01F, G), we first sought to investigate whether CAF-induced polarization of M2 macrophages is concomitant with the loss of tumoricidal properties of monocytes. In order to assess this phenotype, we co-cultured luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 BC cells (MDA-MB-231-luc) with monocytes maintained in the control medium, NF-CM, or CAF-CM. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, in co-cultured conditions with the control medium, the luciferase activity was remarkably diminished, suggesting the effective tumoricidal properties of monocytes. On the contrary, when monocytes were incubated with CAF-CM, these cells lost their ability to kill BC cells and instead enhanced the proliferation of BC cells. These data propose that CAFs may be able to influence the phenotype of monocytes by polarizing them to an M2 pro-tumoral phenotype, promoting BC cell proliferation.Exosomes secreted from CAF-educated monocytes enhance the proliferation and migration of BC cells and increase the expression of EMT markersTo investigate the effects of TEMo-Exo on BC cell proliferation and migration in vitro, MDA-MB-231 BC cells were incubated with exosomes derived from monocytes educated by CAF or NF. As shown in Fig.\u00a05B, treatment of different concentrations of TEMo-Exo markedly resulted in a significant increase in the proliferation rate of BC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. On the contrary, the proliferation rate of BC cells was not significantly affected following incubation with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from monocytes educated by NF, compared to the cells treated with vehicle control PBS. As expected, BC cells incubated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL control monocyte exosomes had the lowest rate of proliferation. Using a wound healing assay, we also found that the migration of BC cells into the scratched areas of monolayers was reduced in the presence of exosomes derived from control monocytes compared to PBS-treated BC cells. Importantly, we observed that when incubated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL TEMo-Exo, BC cells migrated significantly faster than BC cells incubated with NEMo-Exo or vehicle control PBS (Fig.\u00a05C). Consistent with this observation, we found through a transwell migration assay that incubation of BC cells with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo led to significantly higher rates of migration through transwell membranes than those incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NF-educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a05D, E). Additionally, we showed that exposure to TEMo-Exo induced the protein expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MDA-MB-231 BC cells. As shown in Fig.\u00a05F, the expressions of EMT markers including N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail were found to be up-regulated and the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin was found to be down-regulated in BC cells by the effects of TEMo-Exo. On the contrary, neither EMT markers nor E-cadherin expression were significantly changed by the effects of NEMo-Exo, compared to that of control monocyte exosomes or PBS vehicle control. Overall, it seems that CAFs educate monocytes to secrete exosomes, which up-regulate the EMT markers and impart more migratory behavior in BC cells.CAF-educated monocyte exosomes promote breast cancer tumorigenicity in vivoExosomes derived from TEMo promote breast tumor growth in vivo.\nA Representative images of tumor-bearing nude mice subcutaneously implanted with MDA-MB-231 cells alone or mixed with exosomes derived from TEMo or NEMo. B Representative photographs of xenograft tumors obtained from mice at day 28 post-implantation. C Tumor volume at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after subcutaneous implantation of nude mice with MDA-MB-231 cells alone or mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from TEMo or NEMo. Co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 BC cells and TEMo-Exo together resulted in a faster growth rate of tumors and a larger tumor diameter than that of mice injected with either BC cells alone or BC cells mixed with NEMo Exo. ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001. D Tumor weight in mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 BC cells mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL TEMo-Exo was significantly higher than in those implanted with BC cells alone or mixed with NEMo Exo at day 28 post-implantation. ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001. E Representative photographs of H&E and IHC staining for Ki-67 on formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded MDA-MB-231-derived xenograft tumor sections from different treatment groups. IHC analysis of the cell proliferation marker Ki67 showed much higher immunoreactivity for nuclear Ki67 in the TEMo-Exo co-implantation group compared to the cell-only group or cells implanted with NEMo-Exo. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001To further assess the role of TEMo-Exo in tumor growth in vivo, we established tumor models in 6-week-old BALB/c nude mice by subcutaneously injecting MDA-MB-231 cells alone or MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from monocytes educated by CAF. Tumor sizes were measured three times a week, and the observations lasted over 28\u00a0days after tumor challenges. As shown in Fig.\u00a06A\u2013D, tumor volume and weight in mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 BC cells mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL TEMo-Exo were significantly higher than in those implanted with BC cells alone. To test whether exosomes derived from NEMo also exert tumor-promoting effects, tumor growth in mice implanted with BC cells mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL NEMo-Exo was measured, and the results showed that NEMo-Exo had no effect on promoting tumor growth compared to those of mice implanted with BC cells only. Furthermore, H&E staining of tumor sections revealed that cells from mice implanted with TEMo-Exo arranged more densely with a more irregular cell shape and had increased cell size when compared to the NEMo-Exo co-implantation group or negative control tumor group (Fig.\u00a06E). As Ki-67 indicates the proliferative ability of tumors, we examined Ki-67 expression in xenograft tumor sections. Consistently, IHC results revealed that tumor tissue from mice implanted with TEMo-Exo exhibited stronger positive staining than that in the cell-only group or cells co-implanted with NEMo-Exo (Fig.\u00a06E). Collectively, these results indicate that TEMo-Exo enhance the tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231 BC cells in vivo, while exosomes derived from control-educated monocytes have no significant effect on the growth of xenograft tumors.miR-181a is up-regulated in CAF-educated monocytes and their exosomes and represents a diagnostic potential for BC patientsThe pro-oncogenic effect of exosomes derived from TEMo on BC cell progression is partly dependent on miR-181a. A The relative expression level of plasma-derived circulating miR-181a in breast ductal carcinoma patients compared to healthy controls. A higher level of miR-181a was detected in BC plasma samples as compared with healthy controls, and, importantly, its expression level was correlated positively with tumor aggressiveness, as grade III tumors showed the highest expression of miR-181a with respect to grade I and II tumors. B, C Differential expression of miR-181 family members in TEMo and NEMo (B) as well as their corresponding exosomes (C). RT-qPCR results revealed a higher level of miR-181a in TEMo and TEMo-Exo compared to their normal counterparts. D The mean normalized ratio for miR-181a levels was assessed by RT-qPCR in MDA-MB-231 BC cells at 12 and 24\u00a0h time points. MDA-MB-231 BC cells were pre-treated with RNA polymerase inhibitor \u03b1-amanitin for 8\u00a0h before incubation with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo. The cells incubated with PBS and \u03b1-amanitin were used as a control. RT-qPCR results revealed that TEMo-secreted exosomal miR-181a is transferred to MDA-MB-231 BC cells in a time-dependent manner. E, F Representative flow cytometry histograms (E) and bar graphs (F) of cell cycle distribution in MDA-MB-231 BC cells in different conditions after 48\u00a0h of incubation. Flow cytometry results indicated transfection of miR-181a mimic caused BC cell progression similar to the cell cycle distribution observed in TEMo-Exo-treated BC cells. Additionally, inhibition of miR-181a resulted in the reduced distribution in the S and G2/M phases but induced an increased accumulation of cells in the sub G1 phase. Importantly, the TEMo-Exo-induced increases in S and G2/M proportions were partly prevented by reintroducing the miR-181a inhibitor, indicating that the promoting effect of TEMo-Exo on BC cell progression depends on miR-181a. G, H Representative photomicrographs (G) and bar graphs (H) illustrating the migration potential of MDA-MB-231 BC cells in different conditions after 24\u00a0h of incubation, assessed using a transwell assay. Overexpression of miR-181a recapitulated the promoting effect of TEMo-Exo on BC cell migration. However, miR-181a inhibition dramatically suppressed the phenotypes induced by TEMo-Exo in BC cells. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001Mounting evidence has confirmed that miRNAs play a substantial role in the initiation and progression of cancer. In this regard, the dynamic expression pattern of miRNAs may be associated with the progression of tumors. To identify circulating miRNAs that may be involved in BC progression, we performed a survey of public BC data sets for miRNA expression and found that miR-181a is among miRNAs to be frequently up-regulated in BC. To explore the clinical significance of circulating miR-181a in BC, we measured the expression level of this miRNA in BC plasma samples. RT-qPCR results revealed that miR-181a expression level was significantly up-regulated in BC patients compared with healthy individuals and, importantly, miR-181a expression level was positively correlated with tumor aggressiveness (Fig.\u00a07A). These findings confirm that plasma-derived miR-181a has the potential to be a diagnostic biomarker for BC patients.Being enriched in exosomes, miRNAs secreted from activated monocytes in the peritumoral stroma of tumor cells may contribute to inducing the malignant behavior of tumor cells. To describe the molecular mechanisms by which exosomes derived from monocytes educated with CAF promote the EMT response, we conjectured that miRNAs secreted by TEMo-Exo might account for the oncogenic effects of tumoral monocytes on BC cells. We first measured the expression of miR-181 family members in two groups of monocytes educated by CAF or NF. Fold change analysis in miRNA expression levels revealed a higher level of miR-181a in TEMo, while the expression of this miRNA did not show a significant difference compared to control-educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a07B). We also detected a high level of miR-181a in exosomes derived from TEMo as compared to those derived from NEMo (Fig.\u00a07C).Since exosomes facilitate the communication between adjacent cells by transferring miRNAs, we sought to examine the exosomal transfer of miR-181a from educated monocytes into BC cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL exosomes derived from monocytes educated with either CAF or NF at different time points and compared to control cells. Additionally, to confirm that miR-181a is transferred from monocytes into BC cells and not transcriptionally induced, we incubated BC cells with either monocyte exosomes or PBS in the presence of \u03b1-amanitin, which is an inhibitor of transcriptional activation. As shown in Fig.\u00a07D, a gradual increase in the level of miR-181a was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo, while the level of this miRNA did not show a significant difference in control BC cell groups (i.e., non-treated cells or BC cells treated with NEMo-Exo). These data confirm that miR-181a is enriched in exosomes derived from monocytes educated by CAFs and is shuttled by exosomes into BC cells.The pro-oncogenic effects of CAF-educated monocyte exosomes depend in part on miR-181a in BC cellsTo determine whether exosomes derived from TEMo promote the malignant phenotype of BC cells by transferring miR-181a, functional rescue experiments were performed. The miR-181a inhibitor was first transfected into exosome-treated BC cells. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle distribution revealed that the proportion of BC cells in the S and G2/M phases in TEMo-Exo-treated BC cells was significantly higher than that in NEMo-Exo-treated control cells. Upon miR-181a silencing, the cells accumulated in the sub G1 phase, with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of cells in the S and G2/M phases. Consistently, transfection of miR-181a mimic recapitulated the promoting effects of TEMo-Exo on BC cell progression. Importantly, reintroducing the miR-181a inhibitor abolished the TEMo-Exo-caused increases in the proportions of cells in the S and G2/M phases (Fig.\u00a07E, F). Additionally, the stimulating effect of TEMo-Exo on BC cell migration was recapitulated by miR-181a overexpression. However, the promoting effects of TEMo-Exo on the migration of BC cells were effectively weakened by exogenous inhibition of miR-181a expression (Fig.\u00a07G, H). As miR-181a overexpression recapitulated the phenotypes induced by TEMo-Exo in BC cells, it is suggested that miR-181a shuttled by TEMo-Exo plays a vital role in promoting BC cell progression.miR-181a secreted from CAF-educated monocytes activates AKT signaling partly through suppressing PTEN in BC cellsTEMo-secreted miR-181a activates AKT signaling partly by inhibiting PTEN in BC cells. A Western blot analysis showed up-regulation of the phosphorylated levels of AKT and mTOR in MDA-MB-231 BC cells, 48\u00a0h after treatment with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo compared with the corresponding control cells. Results indicated that the promoting effects of TEMo-Exo on Akt\u2013mTOR signaling were partially abolished when the cells were transfected with the miR-181a inhibitor. B Western blot analysis revealed that when MDA-MB-231 BC cells were incubated with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206, the activation of the Akt\u2013mTOR signaling caused by miR-181a was suppressed. Actin was used as an endogenous loading control. Western blot images are representative of at least three independent experiments. C BC cells displayed the lowest rate of proliferation when treated with MK-2206 at the indicated time points. Although transfection of miR-181a mimic considerably increased the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 BC cells compared to control cells, miR-181a\u00a0did not increase BC cell proliferation in the cell group treated with MK-2206. Points, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01. D, E Representative photomicrographs (D) and bar graphs (E) illustrated that MK-2206 abrogated the promoting effect of miR-181a on BC cell migration. F Transfection of miR-181a mimic caused a significant reduction of PTEN expression at both mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 BC cells, suggesting that miR-181a may regulate PTEN in BC cells. G The mean normalized ratio for PTEN mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR in different conditions, 48\u00a0h after incubation. Results demonstrated that PTEN mRNA levels were considerably decreased in MDA-MB-231 BC cells incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo compared to those cells incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NEMo. In contrast, inhibition of miR-181a in MDA-MB-231 BC cells partially prevented the inhibitory effect of TEMo-Exo on PTEN expression. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. *P-value\u2009<\u20090.05, **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001We next analyzed the intracellular signaling that might be regulated by miR-181a secreted from TEMo in BC cells. As shown in Fig.\u00a08A, western blot analysis demonstrated a significant increase in phosphorylated AKT levels in MDA-MB-231 BC cells that were incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo compared to control cells. To investigate the functional role of exosomal miR-181a in AKT activation, we utilized a miR-181a inhibitor and found that the promoting effect of TEMo-Exo on AKT activation was partially abrogated when MDA-MB-231 BC cells were transfected with miR-181a inhibitor. To confirm that the exosomal transfer of miR-181a functionally correlates with AKT signaling, the phosphorylated levels of mTOR were measured in BC cells. Results showed that\u00a0inhibition of miR-181a reduced phosphorylated levels of mTOR in BC cells. As expected, the promoting effects of exosomes derived from TEMo on mTOR activation were partially rescued in the presence of the miR-181a inhibitor (Fig.\u00a08A). To further investigate whether Akt signaling is critically involved in miR-181a function in BC, we inhibited the Akt activity with MK-2206, which is clinically used for the treatment of human BC. Results showed that although transfection of miR-181a mimic led to the phosphorylation of Akt\u2013mTOR, MK-2206 treatment blocked miR-181a overexpression-induced activation of Akt\u2013mTOR signaling in BC cells (Fig.\u00a08B). Importantly, MK-2206 blocked the effects of miR-181a on the proliferation and migration of BC cells because miR-181a overexpression did not significantly increase the proliferation and migration rates in the group of cells treated with MK-2206 (Fig.\u00a08C\u2013E).Next, we explored the potential mechanism underlying miR-181a-mediated activation of Akt\u2013mTOR signaling. Among the predicted targets of miR-181a, PTEN is a key tumor suppressor gene, dysregulation of which is frequent in BC and is associated with poor prognosis. The PTEN encoding mRNA contains a putative miR-181a binding site within its 3\u2032-UTR (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Since PTEN has been previously identified as a direct target of miR-181a and is a key upstream inhibitor of Akt\u2013mTOR signaling, we conjectured that the enhancing effects of TEMo-secreted miR-181a on AKT activation may be attributed to modulating PTEN. To this end, we transfected MDA-MB-231 BC cells with miR-181a mimic and indicated that miR-181a overexpression led to a significant reduction of PTEN expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig.\u00a08F), showing that miR-181a may regulate PTEN in BC cells. To highlight the functional paracrine effects of monocytes, we first measured the expression level of PTEN in MDA-MB-231 cells that were incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL exosomes derived from CAF- or NF-educated monocytes. RT-qPCR results showed that incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with TEMo-Exo led to a significantly lower level of PTEN expression than those incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NEMo (Fig.\u00a08G). Next, to reveal the functional effect of TEMo-secreted miR-181a on PTEN expression, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-181a inhibitor (100\u00a0nM) and stimulated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL CAF-educated monocyte exosomes for 24\u00a0h. Importantly, following transfection with the miR-181a inhibitor, the inhibitory effect of CAF-educated monocyte exosomes on the PTEN mRNA expression level was partially rescued in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a08G), suggesting that down-regulation of PTEN is specific and largely dependent on the transfer of this exosome-shuttled miRNA. Next to MDA-MB-231 cells, we also examined the effect of exosomal transfer of miR-181a on another BC-derived cell line, MCF-7. The qRT-PCR results revealed that incubating \u03b1-amanitin-treated MCF-7 with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo resulted in a gradual increase in the level of miR-181a at different time points, whereas there was no significant difference in the level of this miRNA in control cell groups. Moreover, results showed that the exosomal transfer of miR-181a from TEMo reduced PTEN expression in MCF-7 cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). Altogether, these findings support the notion that exosomes derived from TEMo play a role as an activator whereby they activate AKT signaling. We also came up with a plausible model in which TEMo-secreted miR-181a activates AKT signaling through regulating PTEN in BC cells.DiscussionIn recent years, the TME has attracted increasing attention due to its critical roles in multiple stages of disease progression, particularly tumor immunosuppression, local resistance, distant metastasis, and targeted therapy outcome. Although BC is considered a heterogeneous disease characterized by aberrant mutations in mammary tumor cells, it is now clearly apparent that such tumors are also diverse by the nature of their microenvironmental composition and the activity of their stromal cell proportions. CAFs, as one of the most important stromal components in the TME, confer a mesenchymal-like phenotype to malignant epithelial cells and support tumor growth and metastasis. In addition to playing tumor-promoting roles in the initiation and progression of tumor growth, CAFs were also shown to sculpt the TME. It was proposed that the tumor-promoting secretome of CAFs may exert potent remodeling effects on tumor immunity, affecting innate immune cell recruitment and activation and polarizing the adaptive immune response.There exists a close relationship between TAMs and CAFs, as TAMs are the most common type of immune cell in close proximity to CAF-populated areas. High infiltration of TAMs in tumors correlates with tumor aggressiveness and reduces overall and recurrence-free survival. There are several TME-derived factors that trigger monocyte recruitment into tumor tissues by a hypoxia-induced chemoattractant gradient. Previous studies demonstrated that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) take part in monocyte recruitment into breast tumors as chemotactic cytokines secreted by stromal cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs obtained from invasive BC could recruit and subsequently differentiate monocytes into M2-like pro-tumoral macrophages in terms of both phenotypic features and functions, in contrast to fibroblasts obtained from normal breast (Figs. 1, 2). Consistently, there are several studies indicating that CAFs induce the M2 polarization of TAMs, which is characterized by an IL-12low IL-10high phenotype and up-regulating M2-specific markers CD163 and CD206. Mounting evidence suggests that redox signaling plays a role in macrophage polarization. It is thought that ROS in macrophages is required for the phagocytosis and clearance of apoptotic cells. However, sustaining a high amount of ROS may not be tolerated by macrophages because inducible ROS has been shown to trigger macrophage apoptosis. The involvement of ROS in regulating the functional reprogramming of macrophages may determine the macrophage\u2019s ability to mediate phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that increasing the levels of ROS in the TME can contribute to the\u00a0differentiation of M2-polarized macrophages. Consistently, we found that the M2 phenotype transformation induced by CAF was concomitant with increased ROS production in differentiated THP-1 macrophages. Despite ROS levels being reduced during M1/M2 macrophage polarization, CAF-induced M2-like macrophages still appear to produce a higher level of ROS than THP-1 control monocytes (Fig.\u00a02D, E). These observations implicated ROS as being a component in the M2 phenotype whose levels may be adjusted by tumor stromal cells.Though the CAF secretome is still not fully characterized, there is evidence that CAF-secreted cytokines and growth factors may trigger the immunosuppressive functions that involve various immune cells and stages of anti-tumoral activity. Recent studies have highlighted the direct implication of CAFs in the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by excluding T-cells from tumors. In line with these findings, our data revealed that CAF-educated monocytes were able to considerably suppress T-cell proliferation, in contrast to their normal counterparts. Moreover, treatment of T-cells with exosomes derived from TEMo or NEMo exhibited effects comparable to co-culture with educated monocytes, indicating the significance of the biological functions of exosomes (Fig.\u00a04). Therefore, by educating monocytes into a distinct population of macrophages that exhibit an M2-like phenotype, CAFs may exert their immunosuppressive effects through driving T-cell exclusion in an indirect fashion.Apart from reciprocal communication with each other, both CAFs and TAMs are in a dynamic interaction with the tumor cells in the tumor milieu. In BC, TAMs comprise about half of the cell tumor mass and can in turn facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. Supporting this notion are the observations whereby the cross-talk between M2-polarized TAMs and tumor cells is responsible for inducing EMT to promote tumor metastasis. Previous studies have shown that immunosuppressive cytokines and survival factors secreted by TAMs promote BC progression and metastasis. Since TAMs may secrete paracrine factors that drive the phenotypic and signaling pathway alterations across the tumor cohort, we here sought to investigate whether exosomes secreted from TEMo affect tumor growth. We revealed that TEMo-Exo augmented BC cell proliferation and migration as well as the expression of EMT markers, while exosomes derived from control-educated monocytes had no effect on the aggressive behavior of BC cells (Fig.\u00a05). Importantly, TEMo-Exo, but not NEMo-Exo, exhibited the potential to induce tumor growth and enhanced the expression of the tumor proliferation marker Ki-67 in BC xenograft tumors (Fig.\u00a06). Tumor cell-bearing athymic nude mice lack a thymus to produce T-cells but possess B-cells capable of producing antibodies in a T-cell-independent way. This model contains intact innate immunity with enhanced natural killer (NK) cell activity, which can reduce the rate of engraftment, growth, and metastasis formation. The subcutaneous heterotopic model is the most common one due to its relative simplicity in design and evaluation, provides realistic heterogeneity of tumor cells, and allows for rapid analysis of the human tumor response to a treatment regimen. As the activity of NK cells tends to increase with age, we utilized younger mice (6\u00a0weeks old) to enhance the engraftment rate, and, thus, the reproducibility of the assays. Our findings led us to suggest that CAFs may aid tumor growth in an athymic nude mouse model of BC by educating monocytes and their derivative exosomes.Although CAFs are important in the formation of TME and in interacting with tumor cells, the effects of their secretome on the behavior of immune stromal cells, particularly in terms of tumor progression, require further investigation. Most current studies focus on the cytokines or regulatory protein factors that are secreted by macrophages. However, close attention needs to be paid to miRNAs, which are considered key regulators of tumorigenesis and, more importantly, are selectively secreted by TAM-derived exosomes. Because aberrant expression and function of miRNAs are common characteristics of malignant cells, these small RNAs provide important opportunities for the development of future miRNA-based therapies for human cancers such as BC. miR-181a was found to be a miRNA associated with BC progression, and up-regulation of which was detected in plasma samples of breast ductal carcinoma patients. Additionally, our data demonstrated that there are differences between exosomes derived from TEMo and their normal counterparts in terms of both miR-181a content and BC cell progression (Fig.\u00a07). To define a possible mechanism through which miR-181a may promote BC cell progression, we explored the downstream mechanism of miR-181a and its relation with the relevant intracellular signaling. Studies on the downstream targets of miR-181a have revealed PTEN as a key tumor-suppressor gene. PTEN constitutes a main inhibitory node in Akt signaling as it functions as a PIP3 phosphatase. Loss of PTEN function results in constitutive activation of AKT which plays a crucial role in breast tumorigenesis. Herein, our functional analyses validated the oncogenic role of miR-181a by regulating PTEN to promote the more aggressive phenotypes of BC cells by activating AKT signaling. As miR-181a overexpression recapitulated the effects of TEMo-Exo on BC cells, it is proposed that exosomal transfer of miR-181a contributes to promoting BC cell progression (Figs. 7, 8).ConclusionsA proposed model illustrating how CAFs drive a more aggressive phenotype in BC by recruiting monocytes in a paracrine manner. CAFs contribute to preparing an immunosuppressive TME by recruiting monocytes and educating them into a distinct population of macrophages exhibiting an M2-like phenotype. As a plausible mechanism, exosomal transfer of miR-181a from CAF-educated monocytes is partly associated with activating Akt signaling and up-regulating EMT markers, thereby promoting breast tumor progression and growthIn conclusion, this study proposed a model illustrating how CAF secretome induces a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by recruiting monocytes. Our study provided the first evidence that exosomal transfer of a miRNA from CAF-educated monocytes may promote BC cell progression through activating Akt signaling (Fig.\u00a09). Given that a miRNA has many targets and may function via different pathways, the current findings do not exclusively demonstrate the exact mechanism by which tumor-educated monocytes affect BC progression. However, our findings suggest that breast CAFs play a crucial role in shaping an immunosuppressive TME by recruiting monocytes in a paracrine manner. We proposed that exosomal miR-181a shuttled by these CAF-activated monocytes was in part associated with activating Akt signaling, thereby promoting BC progression. Obviously, uncovering the pro-tumoral function of CAFs through educating monocytes into a distinct population of macrophages exhibiting an M2-like phenotype holds great promise in targeted cancer therapy. In this regard, a deeper understanding of the intercellular miRNA communication between immune stromal and tumor cells may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention against BC.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerTMETumor microenvironmentCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsNFsNormal fibroblastsTAMsTumor-associated macrophagesTEMoTumoral fibroblast-educated monocytesNEMoNormal fibroblasts-educated monocytesPBMCsPeripheral blood mononuclear cellsEMTEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionCMConditioned mediaSMASmooth muscle actinFAPFibroblast-activation proteinPD-1Programmed cell death protein 1MHCMajor histocompatibility complexMCP-1Monocyte chemotactic protein-1SDF-1Stromal cell-derived factor-1ExoExosomesMiRNA or miRMicroRNADIANADNA Intelligent AnalysisKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesPMAPhorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateH&EHematoxylin and eosinIHCImmunohistochemistryELISAEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTEMTransmission electron microscopyDLSDynamic light scatteringCFSECarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl esterPIPropidium iodideROSReactive oxygen speciesPublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author contributionsSB conceived and designed the study.

        "content": "A considerable fraction of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is located in the fibroblast-rich stromal compartment of desmoplastic breast carcinoma. We analyzed the migratory activity of blood monocytes (MO), the precursor cells of TAM, into 3-D cultures of carcinoma cells and fibroblasts from breast tumor origin. MO migration into breast tumor spheroids was highly variable: Hs578T spheroids showed high MO infiltration rates, T47D cultures were intermediate, whereas BT549, BT474 and MCF-7 spheroids were poorly infiltrated. MO infiltration was also high in tumor-derived fibroblast spheroids; however, no MO subpopulation with specific infiltrative potential was identified by CD14/CD16 expression profile. The infiltration of MO could be inhibited by pre-exposure to pertussis and cholera toxins, but only pertussis toxin, which blocks G(i) protein function, entirely inhibited MO migration. The G(i) coupled CCL2 receptor CCR2A/2B was expressed on roughly all MO. Furthermore, highly infiltrated tumor-derived fibroblast and Hs578T spheroids secreted considerable amounts of CCL2. In line with this, the infiltration of MO into fibroblast spheroids was suppressed by either addition of recombinant CCL2 to disturb the CCL2 gradient or by pre-incubation of MO with a CCR2A/2B blocking antibody. MO infiltration of Hs578T spheroids, however, could not be inhibited by CCL2 receptor blockade. Our study clearly shows that the CCL2-CCR2A/2B pathway is crucial for the recruitment of blood MO into tumor fibroblastic areas, whereas additional factors may be relevant for the migration of MO into tumor cell sites.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

Tumor microenvironment is a whole system which includes tumor cells, stroma cells (such as, adipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, infiltrating immune cells) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the activated fibroblasts, which were named by Tlsty\u2019s group in the tissue of prostatic cancer in 1999, are the primary type of host cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were found in almost all solid tumor tissue (e.g. cancers of the colon, lung, liver, prostate, pancreas and gastric cancer), and play an assignable role in tumor development by cell-cell interaction or cross-talk with tumor cells through secreting growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, CAFs are thought to be \u201cthe dark side of coin\u201d in tumor development.In contrast to normal fibroblasts, CAFs have some of phenotypical and functional abnormality. These alterations of CAFs may be due to its stable gene expression changes. So, whole breast carcinomas stromal by microdissection were explored to analyze the gene expression profiling. These studies have led to new classifications and risk stratification of breast carcinomas into several molecular subtypes based on their gene expression signatures. The global gene expression in the stromal cells has also been shown to powerfully predict prognosis and treatment response. A variety of differences have been identified between breast carcinoma-associated stroma and its paired normal mammary stroma, primarily resulting in increased expression of cytokines (EGF, HGF PDGF, TLL-12, SSP-1, POSTN, CXCL-12, and CXCL14), extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (FBN1, FB2M, SPARC, ADRA2A and ADM) and proteases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-13). These factors were involved in cross-talk between stromal cells and tumor cells by directly or indirectly pattern to promote tumor cell proliferation, cell adhesion and invasion, ECM remodeling. Although, these studies give us the overall configuration of the tumor microenvironment, there are still poor on the role of each member in the tumor stroma, like CAFs, to contribute to the tumor development.Until most recently, the distinguishable features and gene expression profile of CAFs and NFs have been described in breast cancer by Bauer et al.. Their studies show that up-regulated WISP1, collagen type-X (COL10A) and TGF-\u03b2 isoforms in CAFs activate paracrine Wnt-1 signaling in human breast cancer cells or lead to abnormal ECM production in stroma separately. Loss of expression of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 may alter the hormonal milieu in breast carcinomas, and down-regulation of KLF4 participates in the differentiation of resting fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. However, there is still no systematic analysis of the intrinsic relationship between breast cancer CAFs function and its abnormal signaling pathway. The extreme complexity of breast cancer CAFs feature and its roles to tumor development are needed to be further investigated. Furthermore, whether these previous finding in CAFs derived from western country women are also existed in patients of other races.In light of these facts, the principal purpose of this work is to investigate the possible innate nature of biological and genetic heterogeneity between human breast CAFs versus matched NFs in Chinese women. We identified 824 differentially expressed genes: 809 of these were up-regulated, and 15 were down-regulated in CAFs, which included 8 cytokines. The abnormality of CAFs genes and its associated signaling pathways could be involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, signal transduction and protein transport, which were proved in CAFs of other tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we firstly discovered that the altered ATM signaling pathway, which was recently found related to reactive oxidative stress (ROS), is abnormally activation in the early stage of breast cancer. Cell cycle regulated signaling, such as P53 signaling pathway, RB tumor suppressor/checkpoint signaling, regulation of cell cycle progression by Plk3, Cdc25 and Chk1 regulatory pathway are identified to be changed in CAFs. A set of immune associated signaling are abnormality in CAFs, which include natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules. And more importantly, we found that CAFs would be able to promote breast cancer cell invasion under co-culture condition through up-regulated CCL18.Materials and MethodsTissue SamplesAll the human breast tumor tissues and its adjacent normal mammary tissues were collected at the time of surgical reaction at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. None of the patients received adjuvant therapy before surgery. Specimens used in this study were approved by the Ethics committees of Chongqing Medical University.Isolation and Culture of Primary FibroblastsTumor tissue and paired normal mammary tissues were washed 3 times with sterile PBS with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamycin). The tissues were minced with sterile scissors in a fresh sterile culture dish. After digestion with 0.1% collagenase type I (C0130, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 8\u201312 h, tissues were carefully pipetted up and down for a couple of times using culture medium. The mixtures were centrifuged and washed with DMEM to remove the fat and tissue debris. Then, the mammary tissues were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Australia) for about two days. Removed the suspending cells or tissue, the most adherent cells were fibroblasts. The primary fibroblasts isolated from tumor tissues were named \u201cCAFs\u201d, and from tumor paired normal tissues named \u201cNFs\u201d. Cell purity was identified by immunohistochemistry for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence staining for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP following the standard described process previously and manufacture\u2019s protocols. Briefly, cells were grown on cover slips for 24 hours and fixed within 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1% triton-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1\u2236150) for targeting fibronectin (F3648, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam Cambridge) and FAP (ab53066, Abcam Cambridge, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) at 4\u00b0C for overnight. After washing with PBS, cells were then stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1\u2236100, ZF-0311, Zhongshan Goldenbrdge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and DAPI. Immunofluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80 i microscope (Eclipse 80 i, Tokyo, Japan; magnification\u00d7100).MTT and Flow Cytometric AnalysisCell growth was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Cells were plated into 96-well plate at 5\u00d7103 cells per well in 200 \u00b5l of complete growth medium. Cell growth was measured every day. Incubating for the designed time, MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. After careful removal of the medium, 0.1 ml of isopropanol with 0.04 N of HCl was added to each well, and the plates were shaken on a rotator for 20 min at room temperature. The absorbance was recorded on an ultraviolet spectrophotometric reader at a wavelength of 570 nm. The independent experiments were repeated for five times.S-phase was analyzed by using laser scanning cytometry. Cells were processed by standard methods using propidium iodide staining of cell DNA as previously described. A minimum of 20,000 events was collected to maximize the statistical validity of the compartmental analysis. Triplicate independent experiments were done.Preparation of Conditioned MediumMDA-MB-231 cells, CAFs and NFs were cultured in complete growth DMEM for 48 h to approximately 80% confluence. The medium was changed to 0.5% FBS DMEM and cells were kept in culture for another 30 to 36 h. For neutralization experiments, neutralizing antibodies against human CXCL-12 (500 ng/ml), CCL18 (10 \u00b5g/ml), CCL4 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) and control IgG (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were separately preincubated at 37\u00b0C with supernatant for 1 h before performing migration assays. The medium was centrifuged at 1,200\u00d7g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM).Cell Migration and Invasion AssayCell invasion or migration assay was measured via modified Boyden chamber assay as described previously. Briefly, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 cells in 200 \u00b5l serum-free medium were seeded in the wells of 8 \u00b5m-pore membrance modified Boyden chambers (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) coated with ECM (1\u22367.5) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 10% FBS Medium, CM, CM with secreting factor CXCL-12 (100 nM), CCL18 (500 ng/ml) or CCL4 (100 nM) was separately added into the lower or upper chamber as the designed purpose. After 6 h or 12 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C and CO2 at 5%, cells adhered to the upper surface of the filter were removed using a cotton applicator. Stained with hematoxylin in methanol, the invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were counted. The data represent at least three experiments done in triplicate (mean\u00b1standard error).RNA Isolation, Quantitative Real-time PCR and Microarray AnalysisTotal RNA isolated from six paired CAFs and NFs using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA quantity was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometry. Probe synthesis and hybridization performed as the manufacture\u2019s instruction were used to probe the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (44 K; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data were generated after scanning by using an Agilent Scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.5 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The raw data were normalized using quantize normalization and then analyzed by GeneSpring GX v10.0 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Paired Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) was applied to identify differentially expressed mRNA in CAFs and NFs. SAM output was filtered by q\u200a=\u200a0.1. Heatmap.2 function (R v2.14.0, gplots package v2.9.0) was used to plot the scaled expression data of differentially expressed mRNAs.An additional two expression datasets (GSE20086 and GSE29270) on breast cancer associated fibroblasts were downloaded from the GEO website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The raw data of six matched CAFs and NFs in GSE20086 were normalized using the R package gcRMA, GCRMA normalized. The author\u2019s processed data of 15 matched CAFs and NFs in GSE29270 were used in next analysis. Paired SAM were also used to analysis the different expression genes in CAFs versus NFs. In cytokines analysis process, the genes at least fold change >1.5 with an estimated FDR<10% were considered as dysregulated genes.RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). To confirm the differential gene expression pattern revealed by microarray analysis, 9 of randomly selected genes (CDC6, FLI1, S100A9, CDK1, PLK1, MMP9, PECAM1, SHC2 and C9ORF135) were re-proved by qRT-PCR assay. Specific Real-time PCR primers for each of selected genes were listed as Table 1. qRT-PCR was performed by a Bio-Rad CFX Manager instrument (Applied Biosystems) at 94\u00b0C for 15 Sec, Tm\u00b0C for 20 Sec and at 65\u00b0C for 30 Sec using SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II (Takara, Dalian, China). GAPDH were used as internal control for normalizing different samples.Primer sequences for qRT-PCR.Gene\tForward 5\u2018\u20133'\tReverse 5\u2018\u20133'\tSize (bp)\t \tFN\tAACTTCCTGGTGCGTTACTCA\tTGTGCTCTCATGTTGTTCGT\t156\t \t\u03b1-SMA\tGAGGCACCCCTGAACCCCAA\tATCTCCAGAGTCCAGCACGA\t153\t \tFAP\tTGTTCCAGCAATGATAGCC\tCTGCTTTCTTCTATATGCTCC\t186\t \tCDC6\tCCAGGCACAGGCTACAATCAGT\tACACGAGGAGAACAGGTTACGG\t126\t \tS100A9\tGCACCCAGACACCCTGAACC\tACCCTCGTGCATCTTCTCGT\t211\t \tFLI1\tCCACCCTCTACAACACGGAA\tATGTTATTGCCCCAAGCTC\t166\t \tCDK1\tGGATCTACCATACCCATTGAC\tTGGCTACCACTTGACCTGT\t120\t \tPLK1\tAATTACATAGCTCCCGAGGTG\tAGCCAGAAGTAAAGAACTCGTC\t118\t \tMMP9\tTCCCTGGAGACCTGAGAACC\tGGCAAGTCTTCCGAGTAGTTT\t307\t \tPECAM1\tACTCAAATGATCCTGCGGTA\tACTTAACATTTTGGCATGGGA\t98\t \tSHC2\tGCACCTGTATGTCAACACCCA\tTCCTCAAAGGGTCGCATGTCA\t90\t \tC9ORF135\tTCCCATGGATAGCCTTGACA\tGTGCCAGGAATACACCAAC\t160\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \tCCL18\tCCGCCTCGTCTATACCTCC\tCACTTCTTATTGGGGTCAGC\t141\t \tCCL4\tTTCCTCGCAACTTTGTGGTA\tCAGGTCATACACGTACTCC\t140\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \t\nNote: FN, Fibronectin; \u03b1-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle actin; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; CDC6, cell division cycle 6 homolog; S100A9, S100 calcium binding protein A9; FLI1, Friend leukemia virus integration 1; CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; PLK1, polo-like kinase 1; MMP9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; PECAM1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule; SHC2, SHC transforming protein 2; C9ORF135, chromosome 9 open reading frame 135; CXCL12, chemokine ligand 12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1);CCL18, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18; CCL4, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4.ELISA AssaySupernatant from NFs or CAFs were harvested and subjected to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for measuring the immunoreactive levels of CXCL-12, CCL18 and CCL4 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the instructions as supplied by the manufacturer. The ELISA assay was carried out in duplicate in three separate experiments.Gene Ontology and Pathway AnalysisFor detection of significantly over-represented GO biological processes, the Onto-Express analysis tool was used and the permutated P-value cut-off was set below 0.05. The pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs was conducted through the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool and the significantly changed signaling pathways were selected based on P<0.01.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was done using SPSS standard version 13.0 software. Data was shown as means \u00b1 SD from at least three independent determinations. Significance of difference was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant differences.ResultsIsolation and Identification of CAFs and NFsCAFs and their paired NFs were successfully isolated from six primary breast carcinomas and from adjacent normal breast tissue. The primary fibroblasts were successfully cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Both CAFs and NFs could be grown for at least 10 passages. Both CAFs and NFs showed spindle-like morphology (Fig. 1A). But the senescence-like cell would be appeared when the cell culture was more than 6 passages (Data not shown).Characterization of fibroblasts isolated from human breast tissue samples.A. Representative cell morphology of CAFs and NFs. B. Identification of CAFs using fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, and CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP by immunofluorescence staining. C. The biomarker gene expression in CAFs and NFs was re-proved by qTR-PCR, and its relative fold change in CAFs and NFs was displayed. The CAFs and NFs are positive for fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP are high expression in CAFs (magnification 100\u00d7 (cell morphology); 200\u00d7 (Biomarker immunofluorescence staining).The purity of CAFs was identified by fibronectin, which is the fibroblast biomarkers, and CAFs-specific biomarkers including \u03b1-SMA and FAP, respectively. NF and CAFs were positive for fibronectin, more than 95% of CAFs were stained by \u03b1-SMA and FAP (Fig. 1B). These biomarker expression changes were reproved by qRT-PCR in 3 paired of CAFs and NF (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrated that the purified CAFs were isolated from tumor tissue.The Noticeable Heterogeneity of Proliferation, Migration and Invasion between CAFs and NFsThe cell growth assay revealed that CAFs were endowed a significantly growth rate than that of NFs in the same culture conditions (P<0.05; Fig. 2A). The percentage of cells in the S phases measured by flow cytometry was significantly higher in CAFs (33.3\u00b17.1, N>3) compared with NFs (6.6\u00b12.5, N>3) (P<0.05). These data suggested that CAFs had a stronger capacity for proliferation than their paired NFs (Fig. 2B\u2013C). Similarly, CAFs had strong potent ability of migration (Fig. 3A\u2013B) and invasion (Fig. 3C) than its paired NFs.Significant difference of proliferation between CAFs and NFs.A. Cell proliferation determined by MTT assay for three of CAFs and NFs. B. Representative DNA content of CAFs and NFs were tested by flow cytometry. C. The percentages of cells in each of cell cycle phases shown by histogram for CAFs vs. NFs. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u22653 separate experiments (**P<0.01).The migration and invasion of CAFs compared with NFs.A. Cell migration capability was determined by wound healing assay. B. The distance of wound closure (compared with control at 0 h) was measured in four-independent wound sites each group after 24 h. C.

(**P<0.01), (magnification A. 100\u00d7; C. 200\u00d7).CAFs Stimulate Tumor Cell Growth, Migration and InvasionIn order to understand the interaction cross-talk of CAFs with tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, co-culture system was employed to display their role in the cell proliferation and invasion. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from NFs (NFs CM) and control, MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from CAFs (CAFs CM) had significant proliferation (P<0.05; Fig. 4A) assayed by cell growth curve. The proportion of MDA-MB-231 cells in the DNA synthesis (S) phase cultured in CAFs CM (29.8\u00b10.8, N\u200a=\u200a3) was obviously more than that in NFs CM (13.0\u00b12.2, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.01) and control (23.5\u00b11.4, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.05) (Fig. 4B\u2013C). Collectively these studies demonstrate that CAFs had a stronger capacity promoting tumor cell proliferation than their paired NFs in the breast tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the increasing cell invasion was found in the co-culture system of MDA-MB-231 cells with CAFs CM, as compared with the system containing NFs CM or control medium (Fig. 5A\u2013D).CAFs promote proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in co-culture system compared with NFs.A.

The migrated MDA-MB-231 cells were checked by Transwell assay (B) in the co-culture system using condition medium derived from CAFs and NFs. And (D) the migrated cells shown by histogram. E, F. The invasive potential of CAFs and NFs were determined by Transwell assay (E) in the co-culture system using condition medium derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. The histogram to show the average migrated cells each view (F). Data is representative of 5 views (**P<0.01), (magnification: A, B 100\u00d7; E 200\u00d7).To examine whether tumor cells play a role in the biologic behavior of fibroblasts in the stroma, the effect of MDA-MB-231 on the migration of CAFs and NFs was compared. As predicted, more migrated cells were tested in the co-culture of CAFs and CM from MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 5E\u2013F). These data indicated that different effects existed in the cross-talk of tumor cells and fibroblasts.Genes Differentially Expressed between CAFs and NFsTo reveal the essence of the heterogeneity of biologic characteristic between CAFs and NFs in the breast carcinoma microenvironment, gene expression profile was investigated by micro-array assay. Total RNA derived from six paired CAFs and NFs isolated from primary breast infiltrating ductal carcinomas of grade \u0399\u0399 were used in this analysis. Gene expression profiles of pooled CAFs and their pooled normal counterparts were obtained by microarray analysis using the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (Fig. 6A). A total of 25,206 probe sets (transcripts) were present in human breast carcinomas-derived fibroblasts relative to their normal controls. Compared with the expression profile of NFs, 809 up-regulated genes (0.9%) and only 15 down-regulated genes (0.45%) were detected in CAFs using an arbitrary cutoff line of signal log ratio of \u22651.8 or \u2264\u22121.8. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), cell division cycle 6 homolog (CDC6); Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1); S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), matrix metallo peptidase 9 (MMP9), and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) were predominantly over-expressed at high levels in CAFs whereas SHC transforming protein 2 (SHC2) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 135 (C9ORF135) were down-regulated with a high array intensity (Table S1 and Table S2).Gene heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs.A. HeatMap of gene expression data obtained by Agilent micro-arrays analysis from CAF and NF isolated from all six cases (BCa 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were subjected to unsupervised cluster analysis. B. The mRNA levels of 9 genes selected randomly were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C. Signaling pathway analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathway in CAFs vs. NFs.The up-regulated genes encoded for secreted proteins were mostly classified into groups of extracellular region, cell proliferation, and signal transducer activity (Table S3). To validate the microarray data, the expression level of 9 randomly selected genes including 7 of up-regulated genes and 2 of down-regulated genes were re-proved by qRT-PCR between CAFs and NFs (Fig. 6B). Compared with NFs, the expression pattern of all differentially expressed genes in CAFs detected by qRT-PCR was consistent with the microarray results.The Unanimity Heterogeneity of Biological Characteristics and Genes Expressed in CAFsMicroarray assay displayed that most genes up-regulated in CAFs have oncogenic function, including growth factors (FGF2, VEGFC, PDGFC, CASC5, and HGFAC), transcription regulators (MKX, RUNX3, ATAD2, FOXM1, and PTTG1), cell proliferation-associated genes (CENPF, PLK1, BUB1, KIF15, and CRIP1) and members of the Wnt signal pathway (WNT1, WNT5A, LRP6, TCF4, and GBP4). Several genes encoding secreted proteins, such as CCL18, CXCL12, MCM10, ADAMDEC1, MMP9, and S100A9 were also significantly up-regulated in CAFs (Table S3). All of these secreted proteins are able to induce cell proliferation, implying that CAFs play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells.Additionally, microarray results suggest that CAFs may facilitate invasion and metastasis of breast tumor cells. The data listing in Table S1 shows that CAFs promote tumor cell invasion mainly via two of mechanisms: (a) altering tumor microenvironment interactions (tumor-stroma and tumor-tumor) by increasing cell adhesion (PECAM1, ITGAX, CCL4, LPP, and SIGLEC8) and cell-cell interaction signaling (CCL18, DLGAP5, C1QA, STAB1, and TEK), and (b) promoting extracellular region degradation (LYZ, C1QB, MMP9, IGLL1, and IGHG1) surrounding tumor cells (Table S3).Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathways showed that CAFs enriched many serviceable signaling pathways in contrast to NFs in human breast cancer. Maximum change pathways in CAFs were cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathways associated with cell cycle. Compared with NFs, the cell cycle and DNA replication signal pathway in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times, respectively. The alteration of the ATM signaling pathway was absolute significantly. It was recently reported that the ATM signaling was activated under oxidative stress. Our preliminary data indicated that activated ATM signaling was in responsible for cell proliferation of fibroblasts (Data not shown). The change of other pathways was also assignable, such as DNA replication signal pathways, chemokine signaling pathways, PI3k signaling pathways, abnormal activated p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 6C). Herein, the heterogeneity of genes expressed between CAFs and NFs was consistent with their heterogeneity of biological characteristics.The Common Cytokines-CCL18 Obtained by Compared with Published Microarray DataTo compare the shared genes in current work with previous publication in breast cancer CAFs, the mRNA microarray data of breast cancer CAFs and its paired NFs stored in National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE20086 and GSE29270) were used. As shown in Fig. 7, the dysregulated genes of CAFs are 136 (M Bauer), 1339 (M Basik), and 1102 in current work, respectively. The shared dysregulated genes among each of these data were 12 (Bauer\u2019s data vs. Basik\u2019s data), 7 (Local data vs. Bauer\u2019s data), and 93 (Local data vs. Basik\u2019s data). These data indicate that high heterogeneity is indeed existed in the CAFs of breast cancer. The similarity was found for cytokines and chemokines genes in the CAFs. The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained in comparing the current data with Basik\u2019s microarray data.The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained by compared with published microarray data.The number of dysregulated difference genes and shared genes from current work and two other studies in breast cancer associated CAF versus paired NF was displayed in each group. Dysregulated Cytokines in each study were listed. Only the common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained compared local data with Basik\u2019s microarray data (GSE29270).CAFs Provide a Suitable Microenvironment for Tumor Cell InvasionImmune-related genes, including various chemokines (CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18), are also differentially expressed in CAFs (Fig. 6C and 8A). Chemokines secreted by stromal cells surrounding tumor tissue have been associated with tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis through cross-talk between tumor and stromal cells. To understand whether CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18 involving in the cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells, tumor cell invasion was analyzed in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231, or NFs and MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 8B and 8D, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 immunoneutralizing antibody in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 reduced tumor cell invasion by nearly 60%. However, Condition medium (CM) with neutralizing antibody CCL4 had no significantly affect on tumor cell invasion. On the other hand, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 ligand, not CCL4 ligand in the co-culture system of NFs and MDA-MB-231 enhanced transmigration of tumor cells by around 3-fold (Fig. 8C and 8E). Collectively, these studies indicate that the up-regulated chemokine genes in CAFs have contributed to suitable microenvironments for tumor cell invasion.CCL18 and CXCL12 secreted by CAFs promote tumor cell invasion in cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells.A. The mRNA levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. B. The protein expression levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by ELISA in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C-F. Transwell migration assays were used to determine the functional significance of cytokines secreted by CAFs on tumor invasion. Assays were conducted by using either immunoneutralizing antibody (C and E) or addition of ligands (D and F) in the co-culture system. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u200a=\u200a3 separate experiments (**P<0.01), (magnification 100\u00d7).DiscussionCancer-associated fibroblasts have been recognized for their impact on the carcinogenesis, promotion and progression of many carcinomas. Breast cancer is notoriously associated with tumor microenvironment stroma with activated fibroblasts. However, relatively little is known about the relationship of biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs in the stroma of human breast carcinoma. Herein, this study focused on the gene expression profile of human breast cancer-derived fibroblasts in order to reveal the molecular mechanism of how fibroblasts induce a favorable microenvironment to cancer development.CAFs had several pivotal biological characteristics compared with NFs in human breast cancer. Using the CAFs and its paired NFs isolated from breast cancer tissue, the proliferation, migration and invasion of CAFs themselves were memorably higher than that of NFs in breast cancer. And CAFs had the potential capacity for the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Furthermore, the invasion ability of CAFs and breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 could significantly be increased under the co-culture system of tumor cells and CAFs or NFs cells.In line with the finding of the biological difference between CAFs and NFs, the heterogeneity of genes expression profiles and signal pathways were highly consistent with the biological characteristics of CAFs and NFs. The huge heterogeneity of gene expression was found between CAFs and NFs (Table S1 and S2). For example, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and cancer susceptibility candidate 5 (CASC5) took part in the regulating proliferation of CAF itself and tumor cell.Compared with NFs, over-expressed genes in CAFs afford several interesting insights into the dynamics of the carcinoma microenvironment through the special GO Catalogue. The gene ontology and signaling pathway analysis showed that the cell cycle and cell cycle regulated signaling pathways in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times respectively, compared with NFs. Traditionally, p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were cancer suppressor gene, but p53 signaling pathway abnormal activated and over-expressed of BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATR in CAFs may involve in other function in the tumor microenvironment. Similarly, ATM signaling pathway and cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathway may be related to cell proliferation in response to oxidative stress, although they were in responds to DNA damage or DNA strand break in traditionally. These data demonstrated that the vigorous proliferation of CAFs than NFs by some special activated signal pathway. However, the details will be further study for our next work.Moreover, the different invasion capacity between CAFs and NFs may be supported by other sets of genes expression (e.g. FOXM1, MMP9, PTTG1, IGHG1, TM4SF19, S100A9, SDCBP) in the CAFs and NFs. Heterogeneity of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1) were involved in cancer invasion and migration. In breast cancer, the securin protein stability of PTTG1 was correlated with securin accumulation. Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (IGHG1) and transmembrane 4 L six family member 19 (TM4SF19) were related to tumor immune invasion mechanisms and then made the tumor cells immunity. S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9) has been revealed as the metastasis-inducing protein. Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP) was reported involving in cancer metastatic progression. These results support the function of fibroblasts in breast carcinoma to promote cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis.Furthermore, CAFs recruited numerous cells related with tumor angiogenesis, infiltration, which promoted the tumor invasion and metastasis, through secreted some special chemical chemotactic factors. For example, CXCL14 derived from CAFs in prostate cancer and SDF1/CXCL12 derived from CAFs in breast cancer called up macrophages, endothelial cells derived from bone marrow source, M2 mononuclear cells to the tumor tissue respectively, which assisted the tumor formation new blood and lymph vessels. Chemokine signaling pathway and PI3k signaling pathways enriched in CAFs also illustrated that CAFs could promote itself and the cancer cell invasion and migration. These studies suggest that a close and frequent crosstalk between the CAFs and tumor cells exists during tumor invasion and metastasis process.In addition, a set of signaling associated with immune response, activation or immune escape were found in this study. For example, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules are abnormality compared with NFs. Although, its roles in the microenvironment to promote tumorigenesis and/or development for breast carcinoma are keeping study, these finding in current work indicate that CAFs may involve in immune response and/or immune escape of tumor cell.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer associated fibroblasts: the dark side of the coinBreast cancer stem cells, cytokine networks, and the tumor microenvironmentBreast cancer\u2013one term, many entities?Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts promotes the proliferation of a lingual carcinoma cell line by secreting keratinocyte growth factorCancer-associated orthotopic myofibroblasts stimulates the motility of gastric carcinoma cellsRole of cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts in metastatic colon cancer to the liver and their expression profilesCasbas-Hernandez P, Fleming JM, Troester MA (2011) Gene Expression Analysis of In Vitro Cocultures to Study Interactions between Breast Epithelium and Stroma.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute a major compartment of the tumor microenvironment. In the present study, we investigated the role for CAFs in breast cancer progression and underlying molecular mechanisms. Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the CAF-conditioned media manifested a more proliferative phenotype, as evidenced by enhanced messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Cyclin D1, c-Myc, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) expression was well correlated with the presence of CAFs. We noticed that the mRNA level of FGF2 in CAFs was higher than that in normal fibroblasts. FGF2 exerts its biological effects through interaction with FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1). In the breast cancer tissue array, 42% estrogen receptor-negative patients coexpressed FGF2 and FGFR1, whereas only 19% estrogen receptor-positive patients exhibited coexpression. CAF-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasiveness were abolished when FGF2-neutralizing antibody was added to the conditioned media of CAFs. In a xenograft mouse model, coinjection of MDA-MB-231 cells with activated fibroblasts expressing FGF2 dramatically enhanced tumor growth, and this was abrogated by silencing of FGFR1 in cancer cells. In addition, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with FGF2 enhanced expression of Cyclin D1, a key molecule involved in cell cycle progression. FGF2-induced cell migration and upregulation of Cyclin D1 were abolished by siRNA-mediated FGFR1 silencing. Taken together, the above findings suggest that CAFs promote growth, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells via the paracrine FGF2-FGFR1 loop in the breast tumor microenvironment.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

P values are reported as: ns, nonsignificant; *, P <\u00a0.05; **, P <\u00a0.01; ***, P <\u00a0.001; ****, P <\u00a0.0001.Continued.Continued.The relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC was estimated by expression profile clustering using classic CAF markers reported in previous studies, including ACTA2, FAP, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PDPN, THY1 and COL1A1. The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Significantly positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue lines, respectively. The color and size of the nodes indicate the type of cells and P values from Cox regression. Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.

Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered to contribute to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the cell type of origin remains unknown. Since human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) are locally adjacent to breast cancer cells and might directly interact with tumor cells, we investigated whether CAFs may originate from hASCs. hASCs cultured under different conditions were quantified for the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin. ELISA was performed using the human TGF\u03b21, SDF-1\u03b1 and CCL5 Quantikine Kit. The invasion potential of MDAMB231 cancer cells was evaluated using a Boyden chamber with filter inserts coated with Matrigel in 24-well dishes. We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g. expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Our data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion.",

This might be a common mechanism for acquiring metastatic potential in breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, tumours with the same clinical and pathological status may differ in metastatic potential, and therefore lead to different prognoses. Metastasis of breast cancer cells requires decreased cell\u2013cell adhesion, but increased cell\u2013extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, and enhanced invasiveness and motility via secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes and cytoskeletal reorganisation. A well-recognised mechanism for initiating tumour cell invasive and metastatic behaviour is epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which polarised epithelial breast cancer cells acquire a motile mesenchymal phenotype. However, the common mechanisms of induction of metastasis in breast cancers with different biological characteristics remain undefined. A better understanding of such mechanisms could lead to find universal molecular targets for anti-metastasis therapy.The metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is closely dependent on the tumour microenvironment. The fibroblast is the predominant stromal cell type in tumour microenvironment of heterogeneous breast cancer tissues. Tumour cells activate stromal fibroblast cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through the stimulation of paracrine growth factors, and CAFs are more effective than normal stromal fibroblasts in promoting the cell survival, growth and progression of cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts secrete a number of growth factors, including transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), which is a strong extracellular signal regulating EMT in cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts also secrete chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)/stromal derived factor1 (SDF-1) to induce EMT of cancer cells. In addition, ECM, the non-cellular composition of the tumour microenvironment, is mainly synthesised by CAFs. It functions as a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells through ECM remodelling by ECM-degrading proteases secreted from cancer cells with the EMT phenotype.There is a consensus that CAFs can affect the metastatic behaviour of breast cancer cells. However, it is unclear how CAFs affect the metastatic potential of breast cancers with different biological characteristics. In the present study, we demonstrated that CAFs could enhance the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells with different characteristics through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Different EMT programmes were activated in different breast cancer cells because of the different responses to CAF paracrine extracellular signalling.Materials and MethodsIsolation and culture of stromal fibroblastsTo isolate stromal fibroblasts, primary cancer tissues were obtained from three female breast cancer patients at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH; Tianjin, China). These patients had undergone mastectomy but had not been treated with preoperative chemotherapy. The tissue specimens were divided into three parts for histopathological diagnosis, mRNA and protein extraction and isolation of stromal fibroblasts. The investigation and the use of specimens were approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH and written consent was obtained from participants.The breast cancer tissue specimens used for isolation of stromal fibroblasts were diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma with histological grade II and classified as luminal A subtype with oestrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative. Importantly, the specimens were assessed by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) to confirm that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells in the heterogeneous cancer tissue (Figure 1A and B).The fresh tissues were sliced and digested with 160\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 collagenase A (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and 25\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009h. Then the cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) until cells grew into a confluent monolayer. After 2\u20133 passages, a unique homogeneity of stromal fibroblasts was formed. All the stromal fibroblasts used in the experiments were at less than 10 passages. To prepare conditioned medium of cultured CAFs (CAF-CM) for breast cancer cell treatments, stromal fibroblasts isolated from three tissue specimens were mixed and cultured for 48\u2009h, then collected and centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 5000\u2009r.p.m. to remove cell debris.Culture of breast cancer cell linesBreast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, each with different biological characteristics and metastatic potential, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) or DMEM/F12 (T47D) medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100\u2009units per ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells in logarithmic growth phase or at 80% confluence were used for experiments. Breast cancer cell lines were treated with the CM of stromal fibroblasts, diluted with an equal volume of fresh medium for 2 days. An equal volume of complete culture medium was used as the control.Cell\u2013ECM adhesion assayBreast cancer cells were plated in Matrigel-coated 12-well plates at 1 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The non-adherent cells were counted after being cultured for the appropriate time and the percentage of adherent cells was calculated as (1\u2013non-adherent cells/total inoculated cells) \u00d7 100%.Wound-healing assayBreast cancer cells were plated in six-well plates at 5 \u00d7 105 cells per well to grow into a monolayer. A linear scratch/wound was made on cell monolayers with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs were taken of live cells at \u00d7 100 magnification and the distance migrated was observed within an appropriate time.Cell migration and invasion assayThe invasion and migration abilities of breast cancer cells in vitro were evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). 5 \u00d7 104 cells in 500\u2009\u03bcl serum-free medium were added to the upper chamber, and medium containing 20% FBS was added into the lower chamber. The cells were left to invade the Matrigel for the appropriate time, the non-invading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by wiping, and the invading cells were fixed and stained with a three-step stain set kit (Richard-Allan Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The number of invading or migrating cells was counted under a microscope in five predetermined fields for each membrane at \u00d7 400 magnification.TGF-\u03b2 signalling analysisBreast cancer cells were cultured with CM of stromal fibroblasts containing 50\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 TGF-\u03b21 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to neutralise TGF-\u03b21, or 1.0\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009ml\u22121 SB-431542 (Sigma) to block the TGF-\u03b2 signalling of breast cancer cells.Reverse transcription-quantitative PCRTotal RNA of tissues or cultured cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using a First-strand cDNA Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We quantified the transcripts of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal mRNA quantity control, as previously described. All primers and TaqMan probes for cDNA amplification of various target genes were designed and optimised using Oligo 6.0 software (Molecular Biology Insights, West Cascade, USA), and synthesised by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services (Shanghai, China). Triplicate quantitative PCR reactions were performed for both target genes and the housekeeping gene using Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative expression level of the target gene was calculated by normalising the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the target gene to the Ct values of GAPDH (\u0394Ct), and determined as 2\u2212\u0394Ct.ImmunohistochemistryBreast cancer cells growing on sterile coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue specimens were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemistry staining of specimens was carried out using the primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4; DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark), anti-Vimentin (V9; Invitrogen) and anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7; Invitrogen); the secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used at appropriate concentration. Staining was performed with diaminobenzidine; hematoxylin was used for counterstaining.ImmunoblottingHarvested cells were lysed with protein lysis buffer containing 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5\u2009mM EDTA acid, 1% Triton X-100, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% dithiothreitol and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The proteins in the lysate were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The primary antibodies used were anti-Vimentin, anti-E-cadherin, anti-TGF-\u03b2RII (K105; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA), anti-Smad2 (86F7; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-pSmad2 (Phospho-Ser245/250/255; Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20091000, \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20093000, and the secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20092500. The protein blotting on the membranes was performed as previously described. The immunoreactive protein bands on the membranes were visualised using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare).Immunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on the coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009min. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15\u2009min, washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained using DAPI permamount. The protein expression was visualised using a fluorescence microscope.Cytokine antibody array analysisThe TGF\u03b2s secreted from CAFs were analysed using a Cytokine Antibody Array (R&D Systems) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, membranes were incubated with 1.0\u2009ml of CAF-CM at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted biotin-conjugated antibodies were added to each membrane, which was then incubated at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to each membrane and incubated at room temperature for 2\u2009h. The membranes were placed into the mixed Detection Buffer and exposed to X-ray film. The intensities of signals were quantified by ScanAlyze software (Michael Eisen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA). A positive control was used to normalise the results from the different membranes being compared. All samples were performed in duplicates.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation. Student's t-test and rank sum test were used to compare the differences between the experimental group and control group. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.ResultsThe stromal fibroblasts isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibit characteristics of CAFsTo characterise stromal fibroblasts in the microenvironment of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from primary breast cancer tissues. In the primary breast cancer tissue, we observed that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells (Figure 1A), and some of them were active fibroblasts with positive \u03b1-SMA staining (Figure 1B). The stromal cells separated from primary breast cancer tissues were a heterogeneous mixture of a variety of cells in the primary culture, with fibroblasts being the main component. After passaging the primary culture cells, uniform fibroblasts started to grow (Figure 1C). The stromal fibroblasts showed positive staining for the mesenchymal marker vimentin (Figure 1D) and negative staining for the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Figure 1E). In particular, they expressed the activated myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA (Figure 1F) and CXCL12 (Supplementary Figure 1A). These results indicated that the isolated and cultured fibroblasts in vitro from breast cancer tissues maintained the features of CAFs.To investigate whether the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro are retained features of CAFs, we detected the expression of E-cadherin, \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 in CAFs at different low passages. The results showed that the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 were similar in all the CAFs at different passages, and E-cadherin was not expressed in any CAFs at different passages (Supplementary Figure 1B and C), which indicated that the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro retained the features of CAFs.CAFs enhanced aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cellsTo investigate the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cells with different intrinsic characteristics, the CAF-CM was collected and used to culture breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231. The epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells cultured with CAF-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering. The mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells cultured with CAF-CM were also changed to more fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 2A). All the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM had enhanced cell\u2013ECM adhesion (Figure 2B), migration (Figure 2C\u2013E) and invasion (Figure 2F and G) compared with the control cells. All the above results suggested that CAF-secreted proteins could stimulate these different breast cancer cell lines to change their morphologies and phenotypes to have more metastatic potential.CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cellsTo investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by CAF-CM in breast cancer cell lines, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1), mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM) and fibronectin 1 (FN1), as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with CAF-CM. Results showed that cells cultured with CAF-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in MCF-7 and T47D cells, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3A and C). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker VIM, FN1, MMP2 and MMP9 were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM (Figure 3B and D). These results indicated that factors secreted by CAFs could induce the EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.To investigate whether EMT programming was activated by CAF-secreted factors in these breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics, the expression of EMT-related transcription factors (EMT-TFs) snail homolog 1 (SNAI1), SNAI2, twist basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix transcription factor 1 (TWIST1) and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was measured in breast cancer cell lines cultured with CAF-CM. The results showed that SNAI1 expression levels were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM, SNAI2 expression levels were upregulated in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells but not in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells, TWIST1 expression levels were upregulated in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells but not in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells, and ZEB1 expression levels were upregulated only in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3E). These results indicated that CAF-secreted proteins induced the EMT phenotype through common and/or unique activation of EMT-TFs in breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics.CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling in breast cancer cells via CAF-secreted TGF-\u03b21As TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer, we examined whether CAFs secreted any TGF isoform into CAF-CM. Our results showed that CAFs secreted significantly more TGF-\u03b21 than TGF-\u03b22 or TGF-\u03b23 (Figure 4A). We then compared the mRNA expression of the TGF-\u03b21-coding gene TGFB1 in CAFs and breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that TGFB1 expression levels were significantly higher in CAFs than those in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 was mainly secreted by the CAFs in the co-culture of CAFs with breast cancer cells.To investigate the effect of CAF-CM on activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling in breast cancer cell lines, we compared the expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 receptor type II (TGF-\u03b2RII), total Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad2 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CM or control medium. The results showed that CAF-CM significantly increased phosphorylated Smad2 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, whereas total Smad2 was not affected. Although TGF-\u03b2RII expression levels were different in the three cell lines, they were not affected by culturing with CAF-CM (Figure 4C). Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 secretion by breast cancer cells was not affected neither (Figure 4D). These results indicate that CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling pathway in breast cancer cells mainly through paracrine TGF-\u03b21.EMT programming and phenotype were reversed by blocking TGF-\u03b21 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CMTo further test the role of TGF-\u03b21 signalling in EMT phenotype changes of breast cancer cells, TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody and TGF-\u03b2 signalling blocking reagent SB-431542 were added to CAF-CM for culturing epithelial cells MCF-7 and mesenchymal-like cells MDA-MB-231. Then, the expression of epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers and EMT-TFs were examined. After culturing in CAF-CM, the E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells was reduced, and vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was increased. Moreover, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5A). Similarly, the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was also reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5B). Consistent with the effects of TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody, adding SB-431542 in CAF-CM also reversed the reduced E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM (Figure 5C), as well as the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the enhanced abilities of migration and invasion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding anti-TGF-\u03b21 antibody (Figure 5E and F). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 secreted from CAFs was an important regulator for activation of EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.DiscussionIsolation of stromal fibroblasts from invasive cancer tissues followed by low-passaged cultures in vitro is the main approach to investigate the biological characteristics of CAFs and their effects on tumour cells. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin is commonly used as a marker of myofibroblast formation to identify CAFs, and its expression is higher in fibroblasts derived from cancer tissues than in those derived from normal tissues. Evidence has shown that stromal fibroblasts isolated from cancer tissues such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer retain the characteristics of CAFs, with high levels of \u03b1-SMA expression. As luminal A is the most common subtype of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from invasive luminal A subtype breast cancer tissues, and confirmed that the fibroblasts expressed high levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12/SDF-1, which is a typical characteristic of CAFs. Moreover, CAFs at low passages cultured in vitro retained their original features, which was consistent with the Kalluri's report.There have been reports that CAFs could promote aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cells.) demonstrated that downregulation of p16INK4A transformed normal breast fibroblasts into CAFs, which in turn enhanced migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner.) showed that CAFs enhanced migration by promoting EMT of PMC42-LA cells.) found that CAFs promoted EMT of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells, including luminal cells (MCF-7), basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) and cells with both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial characteristics (PMC42-LA). In this study, we demonstrated that factors secreted by CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviours of cell\u2013ECM adhesion, migration and invasion in both luminal (MCF-7 and T47D) and basal-like (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells by inducing or promoting EMT. This suggests that CAF-induced EMT might be the common mechanism underlying the acquisition of metastatic potential in different breast cancer subtypes.EMT enables cancer cells to acquire the ability to complete various steps in the metastatic cascade, and this change in phenotype of epithelial cancer cells is induced by paracrine signals from their microenvironment. It is known that CAFs can induce or promote EMT in a variety of cancers, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not clear. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer. Tumour cells can induce and maintain the EMT phenotype through autocrine secretion of TGF-\u03b2, and can also transform stromal fibroblasts into CAFs by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Although CAFs can also secrete TGF-\u03b2, it is little known whether or how CAF-paracrine TGF-\u03b2 induces EMT in tumour cells. By detection of the CAF-CM collected from CAFs cultured in vitro, we found that TGF-\u03b21 was the major TGF-\u03b2 family member secreted by CAFs. We also found that TGF-\u03b21 was expressed by CAFs significantly more than by cancer cells, and stimulation of CAF-paracrine factors did not significantly increase expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b2RII in the breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, by using a pharmacological inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase to inhibit the receptors of tumour cells, and neutralising antibodies to inhibit secreted TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs, we found that TGF-\u03b21, mainly secreted by CAFs, could induce EMT in different subtypes of breast cancers.Interestingly, we found that CAF-paracrine signalling induced EMT in breast cancer cells with different characteristics are underlying common and/or unique pleiotropically acting EMT-TFs. SNAI1 was activated by CAF-CM in the three breast cancer cell lines: epithelial/luminal A cells MCF-7 and T47D, and mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells MDA-MB-231. SNAI2 and ZEB1 were activated in epithelial/luminal A cells (SNAI2 in both MCF-7 and T47D, ZEB1 only in MCF-7) but not in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231). TWIST1 was activated in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) but not in epithelial cells/luminal A cells (MCF-7 and T47D). This novel observation indicates that different EMT programmes are activated in different subtypes of breast cancer cells specific to their responses to CAF-paracrine signalling. Another interesting finding in our in vitro experiments is that exogenous TGF-\u03b2 alone did not promote EMT of breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, although TGF-\u03b2 is a key modulator secreted by CAFs for promoting EMT of breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics, it needs co-factors to facilitate this process, and the exact mechanism remains to be further explored.In summary, CAFs could stimulate morphological and phenotypic changes in various breast cancer subtype cells to enhance their metastatic potential through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. This might be a common mechanism for metastasis among breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on British Journal of Cancer website (http://www.nature.com/bjc)This work is published under the standard license to publish agreement.

        "title": "Apigenin inhibits TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b1-induced CCL2 release through IKBK-epsilon signaling in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.",
        "content": "Mortality associated with breast cancer is attributable to aggressive metastasis, to which TNF\u03b1 plays a central orchestrating role. TNF\u03b1 acts on breast tumor TNF receptors evoking the release of chemotactic proteins (e.g. MCP-1/CCL2). These proteins direct inward infiltration/migration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), T-regulatory cells (Tregs), T helper IL-17-producing cells (Th17s), metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Tumor embedded infiltrates collectively enable immune evasion, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In the current study, we investigate the potential of apigenin, a known anti-inflammatory constituent of parsley, to downregulate TNF\u03b1 mediated release of chemokines from human triple-negative cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). The results show that TNF\u03b1 stimulation leads to large rise of CCL2, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6, all suppressed by apigenin. While many aspects of the transcriptome for NFkB signaling were evaluated, the data show signaling patterns associated with CCL2 were blocked by apigenin and mediated through suppressed mRNA and protein synthesis of IKBKe. Moreover, the data show that the attenuation of CCL2 by apigenin in the presence TNF\u03b1 paralleled the suppression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK 1/ 2).

TNF\u03b1 acts on breast tumor TNF receptors evoking the release of chemotactic proteins (e.g. MCP-1/CCL2). These proteins direct inward infiltration/migration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), T-regulatory cells (Tregs), T helper IL-17-producing cells (Th17s), metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Tumor embedded infiltrates collectively enable immune evasion, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In the current study, we investigate the potential of apigenin, a known anti-inflammatory constituent of parsley, to downregulate TNF\u03b1 mediated release of chemokines from human triple-negative cells (MDA-MB-231 cells). The results show that TNF\u03b1 stimulation leads to large rise of CCL2, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6, all suppressed by apigenin. While many aspects of the transcriptome for NFkB signaling were evaluated, the data show signaling patterns associated with CCL2 were blocked by apigenin and mediated through suppressed mRNA and protein synthesis of IKBKe. Moreover, the data show that the attenuation of CCL2 by apigenin in the presence TNF\u03b1 paralleled the suppression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK 1/ 2). In summary, the obtained findings suggest that there exists a TNF\u03b1 evoked release of CCL2 and other LSP recruiting cytokines from human breast cancer cells, which can be attenuated by apigenin.IntroductionBreast cancer is a leading cause of death in women worldwide, despite medical advances in surgical techniques, radiation and chemotherapy. There is a continued need to identify preventive and adjunctive chemosensitization agents in the management of breast cancer. Apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is naturally occurring bioactive compound (NOBC) found in parsley, garlic, and celery. The biological relevance of apigenin in management of breast cancer is evidenced by the growing pool of research (in vitro and xenograft tumor models) demonstrating its capacity to inhibit tumor promoting enzymes, overcome chemoresistance and/or multi-drug resistance, prevent angiogenesis metastasis and lessen the growth of aggressive breast cancers. There is also a plethora of research showing apigenin as a cytostatic agent with capacity to attenuate clonogenic survival in a wide range of breast cancer cells; MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, Hs578T, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468 Cells, T47D and BT-474 Cells. Biological targets of apigenin relevant to tumor potential are known to involve MAPK/NFkappaB, phospho-JAK1/ STAT3 signaling, VEGF, aromatase, proteasomal processes, fatty acid synthase and the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD).Despite surmounting evidentiary support for apigenin in tumor suppression, there is lack of research regarding its influence on the tumor microenvironment in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically TNF\u03b1. TNF\u03b1 is present in high concentrations throughout the breast tumor/ stroma milieu, and upon activation of TNF\u03b1 receptors, can trigger a powerful perpetual cascade of NF-\u03baB activation. epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and sustained release of diverse chemokines (i.e., CCL2/CCL5). Chemokines in turn ultimately trigger inward migration of a large number of leukocyte sub-populations (LSPs) bearing CCR2 / CCR5 receptors that embed into the tumor, and further drive tumor aggression and stem cell survival. Tumor promoting LSPs are known to include tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), T-regulatory (Tregs) metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs), T helper IL-17-producing cells (Th17) cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).Thus, given the dynamic control of diverse chemokines as key trafficking molecules released by tumor cells in response to TNF\u03b1 capable of driving LSP recruitment, here we investigated the effects of apigenin on TNF\u03b1 mediated chemokine release in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells.ResultsA basic cell viability in MDA-MB-231 cells was performed to establish appropriate non-lethal working concentrations of apigenin and TNF\u03b1 (Fig 1A) and (Fig 1B), respectively. Based on these baseline studies, we chose the concentrations of 40\u03bcM of apigenin and 40ng/ml of TNF\u03b1 to carry out all subsequent studies. A semiquantitative analysis was performed to study the cytokine release pattern, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and +/- apigenin, using sandwich-based protein arrays from RayBiotech (Norcross, GA, USA). The data obtained show that TNF\u03b1 caused significant upregulation of few specific cytokines. These cytokines included GM-CSF, CCL2, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6 (Fig 2A\u20132D) IL-8 and GRO CXCL1/CXCL2/CXCL3 a/b/g (Fig 3A\u20133D), some of which were downregulated by apigenin and subject to further validation by ELISA assays. First, the densitometry array values (reflected by INT/MM2) are shown for the effect of apigenin on TNF\u03b1 mediated release of GM-CSF (Fig 4A), IL-6 (Fig 4B), CCL2 and IL-1\u03b1 (Fig 4C). Results were then validated by independent ELISA, where the data paralleled between the findings in the arrays for both CCL2 and IL-1\u03b1 (Fig 5A and 5B).The effect of apigenin (A) and TNF\u03b1 (B) on cell viability of MDA-MB-231 cells at 5% CO2/Atm for 24 Hr.

Biorad (Hercules, CA, USA). The data show a lack of significant changes in all mRNAs involved with NF-\u03baB transcriptome pathway, where IL-1\u03b1 shows a distinct but non-significant change (Fig 6A and 6B and Table 1). The lack of data as reflected by this RT-PCR NF-\u03baB array was surprising, but a limitation to this array was the absence of IKBK-epsilon which plays a pivotal role in driving tumor malignancy in both TNBC and receptor positive breast cancer cells. Therefore, in the next study, we investigate changes in IKBK-epsilon transcription determined by RT-PCR (Fig 7A) and protein expression using Western blot (Fig 7B). These findings validate IKBK-epsilon to be the major proponent of NF-\u03baB signaling control involved with TNF-\u03b1 mediated rise in CCL2 release and its reduction by apigenin. In the next study, we demonstrate additional influential effects of MAPK signaling on TNF-\u03b1 mediated CCL2 release, focusing on changes in phospho-ERK protein, also downregulated by apigenin (Fig 8). These findings show that apigenin can alter TNF-\u03b1 mediated breast cancer signaling pathways that control the release of CCL2, which in part involve IKBK-epsilon, and ERK, both essential biological events required for TAM infiltration and recruitment into solid breast tumor tissue.NF-kB PCR microarray assessment on MDA-MB-231 cells \u00b1 TNF\u03b1 \u00b1 Apigenin.The data displays differential transcription for controls vs. TNF\u03b1 (A) and TNF\u03b1 vs. TNF\u03b1 + Apigenin (B) in MDA-MB-231 cells treated for 24 hours.

Here we demonstrate the ability of apigenin to block TNF\u03b1 mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which are themselves responsible for inward migration of leukocytes that drive tumor growth, metastatic invasion, stem cell survival and immune evasion.TNF\u03b1 evoked release of tumor-promoting chemokines such as CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL5 (RANTES) and CXCL8 (IL-8) trigger infiltration of CCR2/CCR5 receptor bearing leukocyte sub-populations (LSPs) including TAMs, MDSCs, TANs, Tregs, MAMs and CAFs. While all LSP subtypes enable a tumor permissive and the evasive immune environment, independently, each LSP can confer a unique independent effect. For example, the arrival of MDSCs leads to potent immunosuppression by disabling the normal function of T and NK cells. Whereas, the arrival of TANS perpetuates a sustained release of CCL2, GM-CSF, CCL17 which correspond to elevated tumor size, microvascular invasion and inward migratory activity of the macrophages and Tregs. Reported results on Tregs indicate a direct role in suppression of antitumor immunity by attenuating the T-cell-mediated tumor cell killing and secreting TGF-beta1. Meanwhile, the collective activity of TANS and MDSCS both yield the perpetual release of CCL2 and M-CSF fostering synergistic infiltration of TAMS. TAMS, upon arrival, can then lead to even more release of promoting cytokines: TGF-beta, MMPs, VEGF, CM/M-CSF, CCL 17, IL-13 and CCL2 which secure pro-angiogenic tumor processes. In aggressive malignancies, metastatic MAMs arrive at secondary sites and in turn recruit inflammatory CCR2 bearing monocytes by CCL2, which in themselves release CCL3 and express CCR1, amplifying tumor potential. LSP tumor infiltration is a vastly complex topic, yet all of these studies suggest the importance of controlling the chemokines produced and released by tumor tissue.The current study shows that apigenin can downregulate TNF\u03b1 mediated release of CCL2, largely attributable to its ability to downregulate IKBKe. The importance of IKBKe in driving tumor malignancy potential in both TNBC and receptor positive breast cancer cells are known. Moreover, there is a correlation between concentration of IKBKe and activated JAK/SAT TRAF2 Akt/PI3K phosphorylated p65-NFkB and NF-kB activation. Likewise, numerous studies show many of these signaling pathways are blocked by apigenin in tumor models in particular NF-kB signaling which controls the downstream release of TGF-b and activity of MMP-9, themselves involved with TAM/TANs and Treg recruitment.The capacity of apigenin to block CCL2 is important because this single event is not only in control of infiltrating/migratory activity of CAFs, TAMS, TANS, and MSCs into the tumor environment but enables its perpetual ongoing accelerated release of CCL2, CXCL8, CCL5, mediated by through NF-kB signaling. There is sufficient evidence to show that initial release of chemokines such as CCL2, GM-CSF mark a potentially irreversible turning point for tumor infiltration, immunological evasion, and tumor immune support. Natural plant-derived chemicals that can downregulate CCL2 or act as CCR2 receptor antagonists such as luteolin esculetin or EGCG typically result in impaired migration, less proclivity for metastasis enabling greater efficacy of immunotherapies and chemotherapy drugs.In summary, these findings show that apigenin can block TNF\u03b1 mediated release of CCL2 in a TNBC cell line. While the experimental evidence for the therapeutic application of apigenin in cancer treatment is growing, human clinical trials are lacking. Future studies will be required to determine if apigenin can be used clinically to establish long-term remission in cancer patients.Materials and methodsCell line, chemicals, and reagentsTriple-negative human breast tumor (MDA-MB-231) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin were all obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Recombinant human TNF\u03b1 was purchased from RayBiotech (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, GA, USA). Apigenin was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom).Cell cultureMDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in 75 cm2 or 175 cm2 flasks containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% 10,000 U/ml penicillin G sodium/10,000 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with humidified 95% air and 5% CO2.Cell viability assayAlamar Blue cell viability assay was used to determine cytotoxicity.

Quantitative analysis of dye conversion was measured on a microplate fluorometer\u2013Model 7620-version 5.02 (Cambridge Technologies Inc, Watertown, MA, USA) set at 550/580 (excitation/ emission). The data were expressed as a percentage of live untreated controls.Human adipokine arraySandwich-based arrays purchased from RayBiotech (Norcross, GA, USA) consist of membranes with 62 different proteins in duplicate. Each experiment was carried out by manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, antibody-coated array membranes were treated with 1 ml of medium from resting, apigenin-treated (40 \u03bcM), TNF\u03b1-treated (40 ng) and co-treated cells and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rocker/shaker.

The mixture of biotin-conjugated antibodies was removed, and membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated streptavidin (2 h). After a final wash, membrane intensity was acquired using chemiluminescence and analyzed using Quantity One software (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules. CA, US). Densities were calculated by subtracting blanks values from each array, then calculating all values as a percentage of the positive control spots on each membrane multiplied by an arbitrary averaged control values across all arrays in one individual test set. The data are represented as Density (Intensity (INT)/MM2).CCL2 and IL-1\u03b1 detection by ELISASupernatants from resting and stimulated (24 h) MDA-MB-231 cells were collected and centrifuged at 100\u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. Specific ELISAs were performed using MCP-1/ CCL2 ELISA kits (RayBiotech) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of supernatants from samples and standards were added to 96-well plates pre-coated with capture antibody. After incubation, 100 \u03bcl of prepared biotinylated antibody mixture was added to each well. After one hour, the mixture was decanted, and 100 \u03bcl streptavidin solution was placed in each well and incubated. Substrate reagent (100 \u03bcl) was then added to each well followed by the addition of 50 \u03bcl stop solution 30 min later.

Specifically, high rates of metastasis to the lymph nodes, lungs, bone and brain, not the primary tumor, are the leading cause of breast cancer death. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis may lead to more effective strategies for the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer.Growing evidence indicates that malignant breast tissue requires complex local and systemic stromal interactions to provide a tumor-promoting environment during breast carcinoma development and progression. Specifically, tumor stromal cells cross-communicate and develop an aggressive phenotype of cancer cells, which are recognized as an important modulator and even a driver of tumorigenicity. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component of the tumor microenvironment, have been proven to be a major contributor of various processes, such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and drug resistance. These effects are mediated by paracrine stimulation from a variety of growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukins (IL). Our previous study indicated that CAFs stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impaired taxol efficacy in breast cancer by elevating NF-\u03baB/miR-21 signaling. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which CAFs feed the cancer cells and allow them to acquire an aggressive phenotype and the molecular mediators involved in these processes have not been extensively studied.In addition to the several well-documented gene mutations that have been associated with the development of breast cancer, considerable attention is being focused on the participation of epigenetic events, including the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. Highly up-regulated in breast cancer, the lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) mediates H3K27 tri-methylation and the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is considered a key molecule and potential biomarker for breast cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR is reportedly involved in drug resistance and stemness maintenance in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, growing evidence indicates that HOTAIR promotes metastasis breast, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma. Given its critical role during tumor progression, HOTAIR is a novel target for breast cancer therapy.The activation of CDK5 signaling has been implicated in the control of cell motility and metastatic potential, which are significantly correlated with several markers of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that the aberrant activation of CDK5 signaling is associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which was responsible for high-dose taxol-induced invasion and EMT. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of CDK5 remains elusive. Moreover, CDK5 was proven to be essential for TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in breast cancer progression. Strikingly, aberrant CDK5 promoter DNA hypomethylation was identified in the mantle cell lymphoma genome compared with normal naive B cells. These findings indicate an interaction between CDK5 signaling and tumor stromal cells, which may underlie the novel epigenetic mechanism of tumor environment-induced metastasis and hold therapeutic potential in breast cancer.Based on these previous studies, we further demonstrated that CAFs promoted the metastasis of breast cancer cells via paracrine TGF-\u03b21, which is a crucial mediator of the interaction between stromal and cancer cells. Importantly, CAFs transactivated HOTAIR to promote EMT. Strikingly, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4. Additionally, CAFs mediated HOTAIR expression and EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling, and H3K27 trimethylation was highly enriched at the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. Overall, we describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the CAF-induced aggressive behavior of cancer cells, which support the targeting of the TGF-\u03b21/ HOTAIR axis as a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.MethodsCell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The CAFs were isolated and cultured as described previously. CAFs were acquired from four invasive breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), and the use of specimens was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH. CAFs were obtained from tissues that had been cut into small pieces and digested with collagenase type I (1\u2009mg/mL; Sigma) and hyaluronidase (125\u00a0units/mL; Sigma) for 6\u2009h in DMEM without FBS at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After filtering the undigested tissues, the stromal fraction was centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) or RMPI Medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Cytokine antibody arrayThe profiles of cytokines secreted by CAFs were detected in the culture supernatants using a Human Cytokine Array (RayBiotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cytokines with distinct differences in expression were screened out.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The culture medium was removed and used to assess the level of extracellular TGF-\u03b21 with a TGF-\u03b21 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, abcam) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results are expressed in ng/mL.Western blottingThe total protein was extracted with cold radio-immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The cell lysates were separated using 8-10% SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Antibodies against human CDK5, CDK5RAP1, H3K27me3, EZH2 (1:1000 dilutions, Cell Signaling Technology), Egr-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin (1:1000 dilutions, Abcam), and \u03b2-actin (1:4000 dilutions, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. Rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. The antibody-labeled protein bands on membranes were detected with a G-BOX iChemi XT instrument (Syngene).ImmunofluorescenceAfter various treatments, cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100 for 10\u2009min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1\u2009h. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted with antibodies against \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and vimentin (1:100 dilutions, Abcam). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Technologies) secondary antibodies. To detect the formation of stress fibers, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscopes. Cells from three independent experiments in which at least 300 cells were counted were quantified.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the standard protocol. HOTAIR cDNA was obtained from total RNA using the Fast Quant RT Kit (TIANGEN). Real-time PCR was performed using Super Real Pre Mix Plus SYBR Green (TIANGEN) on an ABI-7500 Real-time PCR machine (Life Technologies).The following thermocycling protocol was employed: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 40\u00a0cycles. GAPDH was used as the internal control. Data are presented as fold changes (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct) and were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software V 2.02 (MJ Research).Wound-healing assayApproximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 cells or 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MCF-7 cells were plated in six-well plates after different treatments. A linear scratch/wound was made on the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs of live cells were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification, and the distance migrated was observed after 48\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h.Matrigel invasion assayThe Matrigel invasion assay was performed in 24-well Transwell culture plates. Briefly, 40\u2009\u03bcL of Matrigel (1\u2009mg/mL, BD) was applied to 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane filters. Approximately 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MDA-MB-231 cells or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MCF-7 cells were resuspended and then seeded in 24-well Transwell plates containing FBS-free medium in the upper chamber and complete growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the lower chamber for 24\u00a0h or 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Non-invading cells were removed from the upper surfaces of the invasion membranes, and the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin. The average number of cells per field was determined by counting the cells in six random fields per well. Cells were counted in four separate fields in three independent experiments.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)The expression of HOTAIR in paraffin-embedded sections and cells of different conditions seeded on the sterile coverslips for 48\u00a0h was examined in situ hybridization. First, we deparaffinized and rehydrated the samples. Before digesting samples with proteinase K, we used 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the paraffin-embedded sections and DEPC water to fix the cell samples. We then hybridized samples with a 5\u2019Cy3-labeled modified HOTAIR probe (6\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After completing the hybridization, the samples were successively washed twice with solution buffer (2\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7, chloride sodium citrate buffer) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min each. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using an FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)The EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) was used to perform the ChIP assays. Briefly, 1% formaldehyde was used to fix cells, and 0.125\u00a0M glycine was then used to neutralize the formaldehyde. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer with SDS and protease inhibitors. Soluble chromatins of 200-1000\u00a0bp were collected after sonication and pre-cleared in 1:10 dilution buffer, followed by incubation with IgG, H3K27me3 and EZH2 anti-bodies on a rotating platform overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing the immunocomplexes captured by protein G-Sepharose beads, the bound DNA fragments were eluted for real-time qPCR analysis using ChIP primer.Luciferase reporter assayThe upstream 2.5\u2009kb promoter regions of HOTAIR were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (GV238 vector), and the mutations of predicted SMADs binding sites were also cloned into the same luciferase reporter vector. Cells were co-transfected with SMAD plasmid GV219 vector and HOTAIR plasmid (wild type or mutant) for 24\u00a0h, and the promoter activities were examined with a luciferase assay.Orthotopic nude mouse models and treatmentBALB/c nude mice aged 4-6\u00a0weeks were purchased from the Animal Center at the Cancer Institute at Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Lenti-HOTAIR or Lenti NC and CAFs were injected into the mammary fat pads of each nude mouse at a ratio of 1:3. The mice were imaged for luciferase activity with an IVIS imaging system once per week.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry analysisThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to an immunohistochemistry analysis. After blocking with 3% H2O2 and non-immune rabbit serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by a streptavidin-biotinylated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The chromogenic substrate was developed with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine, andhematoxylin was used for counter staining. The results were visualized using a light microscope.Statistical analysesSPSS 16.0 (IBM, USA) was used for all calculations. All values are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made using Student\u2019s t-test, and differences among groups were assessed with a two-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significance was set to P\u2009<\u20090.05.*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01.ResultsParacrine TGF-\u03b21 was essential for CAFs to promote the metastasis of breast cancer cellsTGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated cells. a Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of CAFs. b The top ten cytokine secreted by CAFs. Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of MCF-7 (c), MDA-MB-231(e) and by treatment of CAF-CM. Relative signal intensity of top ten increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (d), MDA-MB-231(f), compared to the control cellsDuring breast cancer progression, CAFs may supply appropriate signals that may promote the development of aggressive phenotypes in carcinoma cells and establish a complex scenario, which culminates in metastasis. To identify the cytokines secreted by CAFs that enhance tumorigenic ability, the cytokine profiles of cell supernatants from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and treatment with conditioned media of CAFs (CAF-CM) were analyzed using a RayBiotech Human Cytokine Antibody Array. The top four cytokines secreted in the supernatant of CAFs were TGF-\u03b21, IGFBP-4, IGF-1 and PDGF-AA (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in both CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (Fig. 1c, d) as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to control cells (Fig.1e, f).To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, the distribution of TGF-\u00df1 in clinic samples was performed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). It\u2019s well documented that CAFs strongly expressed \u03b1-SMA, whereas were negative for the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin-7 and TGF-\u00df1 showed that the red fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 colocalized with green fluorescence of \u03b1-SMA, but not with cytokeratin-7 in both invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. More important, much more and stronger fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 was detected in invasive breast carcinoma, compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively, these results indicated that TGF-\u00df1may be secreted by CAFs.Paracrine TGF-\u03b21 was enssential for CAFs induced EMT. a The amount of TGF-\u03b21 released into the cell culture supernatant of cells treated with CAF-CM was determined by ELISA. b The wound-healing assay of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor SB431542 (SB) or pirfenidone (PFD), respectively. c SB or PFD treatment impaired the CAF-mediated increase in invading cancer cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. d Western blotting analysis for E-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b2-catenin of cells treated as in (b). e Immunofluorescence staining showed that treatment with SB or PFD increased E-cadherin levels, decreased vimentin and nuclear \u03b2-catenin distribution in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. CAFs promoted F-actin polymerization and stability in cancer cells, whereas treatment with SB or PFD impaired the formation of stress fibers. Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcmDue to the changes of quantity and quality in CAFs from different patients, we extracted CAFs from four invasive breast carcinomas patients to reduce the original difference in this study (Additional file 1: Figure S2). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with conditioned media of CAF1#, CAF2#, CAF3# and CAF4#, respectively. ELISA further confirmed all of the four CAFs populations induced significant increased TGF-\u03b21 level in the supernatants from CAF-CM-treated cells (mean value: 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 6.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.243\u00a0ng/ml in MCF-7 cells; 0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 4.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0ng/ml in MDA-MB-231 cells) (Fig.\u00a02a, Additional file 1: Figure S3). We then further evaluated the role of TGF-\u03b21 in CAFs induced EMT of cancer cells. We found that TGF-\u03b21 treatment achieved similar enhanced the migratory activity of cancer cell, compared with CAF-CM treated cells (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the small-molecule inhibitors of TGF-\u03b21, SB451332 (SB) or Pirfenidone (PFD) treatment abrogated the CAF-CM induced promotion of cell migration. Moreover, all of the four CAFs populations were competent in enhancing the cell invasive ability, while the number of invading cells was deceased 2- to 3.5-fold in SB or PFD treated cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Figure S4). Moreover, SB and PDF treatment markedly rescued the induction of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin expression as well as the repression of E-cadherin in CAF-CM-treated cells (Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescent images showed that SB or PFD treatment decreased the nuclear signals of \u00df-catenin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the nuclear translocation to the cytoplasm was promoted (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the remodeling and polarization of F-actin was observed after CAF stimulation, whereas the formation of a stress fiber pattern was abolished after SB or PFD treatment. These results identified TGF-\u03b21 as a crucial mediator of the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer cells and TGF-\u03b21 was necessary for CAFs to induce EMT of cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT by activating the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cellsCAFs enhanced the expression of the lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cells to induce EMT. a The expression of seveal metastasis associated LncRNAs treated with CAF-CM was measured by RC-PCR. HOTAIR levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells upon treatment with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, SB or PFD was measured by real-time RT-PCR (b) or FISH (c). Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. d Western blotting indicated that the EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression levels were significantly increased in CAF-CM-treated cells. e The expression levels of the indicated epithelial or mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were measured by western blotting. f The depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invaded cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. Quantitation of invasive MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. For each measurement, \u2265\u200910 fields of view with \u2265\u2009100 cells were analyzed; *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01The epigenetic regulation of lncRNA triggered invasion and metastasis in breast cancer. To study the epigenetic mechanism by which CAFs induce EMT in cancer cells, the expression of several lncRNAs were measured by RT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a). Specifically, CAF-CM resulted in the largest increases in HOTAIR expression, 3.5- and 8.7-fold increases inMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to the control cells. Similar to CAF-CM, recombinant TGF-\u03b21 also increased the levels of HOTAIR (Fig. 3b). However, the CAF-CM mediated activation of HOTAIR was attenuated after SB or PFD treatment. FISH images revealed that SB or PFD repressed the nuclear distribution of HOTAIR induced by CAF-CM (Fig. 3c), and Western blotting analysis indicated that the protein levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 were notably increased (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the induction of E-cadherin and repression of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin was observed in HOTAIR knock-down cells (Fig. 3e), and the depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invading cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 3f, Additional file 1: Figure S5). Based on these data, we concluded that CAFs promoted metastasis by activating HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which CAFs activate HOTAIR remain to be addressed.HOTAIR is a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4CAFs activated the transcription of HOTAIR by SMAD2/3/4. a Western blotting analysis of the effect of recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, SB or PFD treatment on the p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. b The HOTAIR expression upon treatment of siRNA against SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 was determined by real time PCR. c SMAD2/3/4 were enriched in the promoter of HOTAIR in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, as determined by a CHIP assay. d A bioinformatics assay showed the predicted binding sites of SMAD2/3/4 within the HOTAIR promoter region. e A mutational analysis of HOTAIR promoter activity. The wild-type and mutant promoter constructs were co-transfected with SMAD2, 3, or 4 plasmids into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assayTGF-\u03b2 is known to assemble a receptor complex that activates Smads thereby assembling multi-subunit complexes that regulate transcription. Western blotting analysis indicated that the levels of phosphorylated of Smad2 protein (p-SMAD2), p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4were significantly elevated in CAF-CM and TGF-\u03b21-treated cancer cells, suggesting that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a04a). However, the repression of p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 was detected in cells treated with SB or PFD. Moreover, RT-PCR showed a 50-60% reduction in HOTAIR expression in cells transfected with SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 siRNA (Fig. 4b). To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying CAF-induced HOTAIR activation, we used ChIP technology to identify the genomic locations bound by SMADs in cancer cells before and after co-culture with CAF-CM. The ChIP results indicated that CAFs stimulate the direct binding of SMAD2, 3, and 4 to the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4c), and a promoter analysis using JASPAR and PROMO indicated several candidate SMAD binding sites in the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4d). The relative profile score threshold set as 80% in JASPAR and the maximum matrix dissimilarity rate set as 15% in PROMO. Accordingly, the deletion of predicted binding sites (Mut-1 and Mut-2) within the HOTAIR promoter region decreased SMAD2/3/4 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the deletion of the remaining mutant binding sites did not result in significant differences compared with control group (Fig. 4e). Therefore, we concluded that SMADs directly bind the promoter site of HOTAIR located between nucleotides -386 and -398, -440 and -452 (the genome coordinates: chr12: 53975342-53975354, chr12: 53975396-53975408), and consequently induced the transactivation of HOTAIR.Based on these results, we elucidated that CAFs transactivated HOTAIR via the secretion TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4.CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signalingCAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling. a Western blotting indicated that CDK5 expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 expression levels were greatly decreased. b The histone methylation status of CDK5 signaling was determined with a CHIP assay, which indicated that H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, whereas the depletion of HOTAIR blocked this function of CAFs. The results are presented as the fold-change over the control. c ChIP analysis revealed that elevated EZH2 was recruited to the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. All experiments were repeated three times. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. negative controlWe previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. Consistent with our previous study, CDK5 protein expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the levels of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 were greatly decreased (Fig.\u00a05a). These findings suggest that the activation of CDK5 was essential for CAF-induced EMT. To investigate the epigenetic events that were involved in the activation of CDK5 in breast cancer, we first examined the histone methylation status using ChIP assays (Fig. 5b). Profiling histone methylation marks on the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter by qChIP showed that H3K27me3 is highly enriched at the promoter of both genes in CAF-CM treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells compared with the control cells. Whereas the depletion of HOTAIR rescued the effect of CAFs, the H3K27me3 levels at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter were remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the recruitment of EZH2 to the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was measured, which indicated that the level of PRC2 components at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was significantly decreased (Fig. 5c). Based on these data, we demonstrated that the activation of CDK5 was required for CAF-mediated EMT. Specifically, CAFs stimulated CDK5 expression by H3K27 trimethylation on the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling.Knock-down HOTAIR inhibited CAF-induced tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivoThe depletion of HOTAIR suppressed CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. a Representative pseudocolor bioluminescence images of tumor size were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors of MDA-MB-231-Luc cells were transfected with control shRNA or shHOTAIR. Each group included eight mice (n\u2009=\u20098). Primary tumor volumes (b) and representative bioluminescence images (BLI) (c) were evaluated. d Lung metastasis was detected by bioluminescent imaging on days 35 and 42. e Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained lung tissues. f The expression of HOTAIR was assessed by FISH. g Representative images of the immunohistochemical staining of CDK5, EZH2, \u00df-catenin, H3K27me3, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 in tissues. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcmTo study the epigenetic mechanism of CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, an MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established in nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging was monitored weekly and indicated that all of the four CAF populations remarkably promoted primary tumor growth, whereas shHOTAIR treatment markedly reduced tumor volume (Fig.\u00a06a-c, Additional file 1: Figure S6). Most importantly, CAFs resulted in dramatic lung metastasis with extensive tumor foci compared to control cells, as determined by quantitative bioluminescence images (Fig. 6d). However, this metastatic phenomenon was attenuated when HOTAIR was knocked down, and H&E staining further confirmed these results (Fig. 6e). Compared to the control group, CAFs enhanced the nuclear staining of HOTAIR, as revealed by FISH, which further confirmed our in vitro study (Fig. 6f). Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed the downregulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and reductions in p-SMAD2-, p-SMAD3-, EZH2- and H3K27me3- positive cells in the shHOTAIR group (Fig. 6g). Taken together, these findings indicate that shHOTAIR treatment efficiently blocked the crosstalk between CAFs and tumor cells, thereby impairing CAF-induced EMT. Collectively, these experiments supported the notion that the secretion TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD pathway in breast cancer cells, resulting in the up-regulation of HOTAIR transcription and histone modification of the CDK5 signaling pathway, thereby promoting breast cancer progression and metastasis.Aberrant HOTAIR correlated with a poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancerOverexpressed HOTAIR correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. a HOTAIR expression was analyzed by FISH. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. b Immunohistochemistry staining detected EZH2, CDK5, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 expression in 59 breast carcinoma samples (39 with lymph node metastasis, 19 in situ carcinoma)To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, we collected 59 breast carcinoma samples and examined markers of CAFs FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA by immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression levels of FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA were significantly up-regulated in invasive breast carcinoma (97.5%, 38 in 39), compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 33.3%, 7 of 20), suggesting that CAFs facilitated tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Compared to DCIS, HOTAIR expression and nuclear staining were higher in metastatic breast carcinoma, as revealed by FISH images, which indicated that the upregulation of HOTAIR strongly correlated with tumor metastasis (Fig.\u00a07a). Furthermore, the expression levels of EZH2 and CDK5 exhibited similar patterns, which further confirmed our in vitro and in vivo studies (Fig. 7b).DiscussionThe proposed model of the paracrine and epigenetic mechanism of CAFs induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. CAFs secreted high levels of TGF-\u03b21, resulting in the transactivation of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells, consequently enhanced metastasisBased on our results, we propose a model of the CAF-mediated upregulation of HOTAIR transcription in breast cancer cells that promotes invasion and metastasis via the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 (Fig.\u00a08). The hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b21 signaling clearly contributes to tumor metastasis and the metabolic reprogramming and activation of CAFs. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 has been linked to poor clinical outcome and is required for the CAF-mediated initiation of efficient metastasis. Consistent with these results, our data further indicate that the key pro-metastatic function of CAFs depends on TGF-\u03b21 secretion (Fig. 2). Specifically, blocking TGF-\u03b21 secretion with SB or PFDefficiently abrogated CAF-mediated metastasis. Our study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 is a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment.Non-coding RNAs have been added to the growing list of gene regulators that contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, mounting evidence has revealed that the up-regulation of HOTAIR contributed to drug resistance and tumor metastasis in various types of solid tumors. In this study, our experiment demonstrated that CAFs upregualted HOTAIR expression via TGF-\u03b21 secretion, supporting its importance in breast cancer progression (Fig. 3b-f). Most importantly, SMAD2/3/4 directly bound the promoter site of HOTAIR, as revealed by CHIP and luciferase reporter assay, suggesting that HOTAIR was a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4 (Fig. 4c and e). These findings suggested that the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs clearly led to the transactivation of HOTAIR expression. And the breast cancer microenvironment plays a key role in maintaining HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. Our studies provide a strong body of evidence to support that the modulation of epigenetic control and targeted alterations of HOTAIR represent novel therapeutic targets in breast cancer.Extensive reports have identified several microRNA induced by CAFs (e.g., miR-26b, miR-148a and miR-133b) that were invovled in tumor progression. Specifically, our previous study verified that CAFs impaired taxol efficacy by activating miR-21 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe that the CAF-mediated expression of long non-coding RNA led to enhanced cell migration and invasion.We previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of CDK5 activation has not been fully elucidated. In cancer, gene expression profiles revealed a loss of tumor suppressor gene expression due to aberrant histone modification. Specifically, Kumar et al. reported that H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter of CDK5 was a key mechanism underlying cocaine-induced plasticity in the striatum. In the present study, we proved that CAFs mediated the transcription of HOTAIR, leading to a strong increase in the H3K27-mediated trimethylation of the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoters, thereby activating CDK5 expression and EMT.Although our study focuses on the TGF-\u03b21, CAFs may also secrete a cocktail of additional pro-metastatic factors, such as IL-6 and IGF-II, to contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, additional crucial lncRNAs involved in the development of breast cancer remain to be investigated.ConclusionsCAFs may orchestrate multiple non-coding RNA and signaling pathways to control several biological processes in a paracrine manner during breast cancer progression. We reported here that secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs was a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal cells and cancer cells to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. Our study revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis, the TGF-\u00df1/HOTAIR axis controls the development and progression of breast cancer, which supports the pursuit of these molecules as targets of breast cancer treatment.Additional fileAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerCAFsCarcinoma associated fibroblastsDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumEMTEpithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionFBSFetal bovine serumHOTAIRHOX transcript antisense RNAPBSPhosphate-buffered salinePCRPolymerase chain reactionPFDPirfenidoneSBSB431542Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12943-018-0758-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Authors\u2019 contributionsMM,CSK and YR conceived and designed this study.

Histological examinations of human tumors show greater stromal content in more advanced and larger tumors, and high content of stromal cells correlates with greater risk of relapse and reduced survival. Fibroblasts are the most abundant stromal cell type in epithelial tumors. Cancer cells dynamically activate surrounding fibroblasts to produce growth factors, hormones, and cytokines that fuel tumor growth, and facilitate progression to metastasis. These activated fibroblasts, termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), regulate cancer cells through paracrine signaling and direct intercellular interactions. In a study of breast carcinoma, about 80 percent of fibroblasts exhibited an activated phenotype.Production of the chemokine CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1) is a hallmark feature of CAFs. CXCL12 signals through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors upregulated on cancer cells, and activates multiple molecular pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Signaling through these pathways promotes survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling axis is highly active in breast cancers. Analysis of human breast tumors showed that among the different molecular subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells have the most elevated expression of CXCR4. Considering the lack of targeted therapies for TNBC, disrupting this chemokine signaling may offer a potential new therapeutic approach. In addition, investigating pathways downstream of this chemokine signaling axis in TNBC cells potentially will unveil new molecular targets for therapy.Studies of interactions among stroma and cancer cells typically use monolayer cell cultures or xenograft models. Monolayer cultures lack the complexity of tumors including a compact three-dimensional morphology, close intercellular contacts, exposure of cells to gradients of soluble factors and oxygen, and non-uniform, spatially-dependent cell proliferation. Thus, cells in monolayer cultures often fail to reproduce key characteristics of tumors. Xenografts present a physiological system for cancer research. However, they are limited in terms of absence of human tumor stroma, failure of some murine cytokines to activate human receptors, disparities in dynamics of tumor growth and progression compared to human tumors, and need for complex tools and biological assays to study stromal effects on cancer cells. Since the introduction of tissue microarrays and next generation sequencing, these technologies have been used for high throughput assessment of biomarkers in thousands of tumor samples from biopsies using standard assays such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridization. These technologies are an invaluable tool in clinical oncology to develop diagnostic tests and identify disease biomarkers. Nevertheless, tissue microarrays and similar biopsy-based assays for endpoint analysis of fixed samples do not capture dynamic tumor-stromal interactions in tumor microenvironments. Tumors constantly transform both spatially and temporally. Interactions between stromal and cancer cells play a major role in conferring functional changes to cancer cells such as gain of cancer stem cell and mesenchymal characteristics, altered metabolism, drug resistance, migration and invasion, and survival. Mechanistic understanding of these complex events in tumors requires approaches that reproduce dynamic signaling of cancer and stromal cells as it occurs in native tissues.Three-dimensional (3D) cultures of cells as spheroids provide relevant in vitro tumor models to recapitulate architecture and complex intercellular network of tumors and emulate stromal-cancer cells interactions. We recently developed a robotic, high throughput spheroid microprinting technology to mass produce homogenously-sized spheroids that exhibit key biology properties of solid tumors. Here, we utilized this technology and formed an array of co-culture spheroids of TNBC and stromal cells to examine CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on TNBC cells. Using different cellular assays and molecular analyses, we demonstrated that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling significantly increases spheroid proliferation and TNBC cell growth. This signaling conferred resistance to standard chemotherapy drug treatment through activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. We found that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling induces sensitivity of the cancer cells to specific molecular inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways, preventing proliferation of TNBC cells. This work establishes the feasibility of studying tumor-stromal interactions using our engineered solid tumor models and offers a convenient preclinical tool to identify new treatment approaches.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) microprinting of TNBC-stromal cells co-culture spheroidsThe ATPS technology facilitates partitioning of cancer and stromal cells to the DEX phase nanodrop to spontaneously form a mono-culture or a co-culture spheroid within 24\u201348 hours of incubation (Figure 1A\u20131B). Importantly, nutrients and waste products of cells freely diffuse between the DEX phase nanodrop and the immersion PEG phase. Adapting the technology to robotics enabled formation of spheroids in standard 384-microwell plates. For co-culture spheroids, we selected a ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells and a total cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/0.3 \u03bcl of DEX phase drop. This ratio was to mimic more advanced and larger human breast tumors that have greater stromal content than cancer cells. Using larger ratios of 1:3 and 1:4 (breast cancer cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial breast cancer cell density constant at 5 \u00d7 103 cells per DEX phase drop did not alter growth of TNBC cells (Supplementary Figure 1), consistent with other studies. This microprinting approach gave consistently-sized mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (5 \u00d7 103 cells), mono-culture spheroids of fibroblast cells, HMF and CAFs, (1 \u00d7 104 cells), and co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF cells or CAFs (1.5 \u00d7 104 cells with a 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells ratio) (Figure 1C). The spheroid size consistency was measured from two separate experiments to ensure that spheroids of each model had a similar initial metabolic activity baseline. Importantly, the 1.5 \u00d7 104 cell density co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells or CAFs were not statistically different in size (p > 0.05), eliminating potential effects of size differences of the spheroids on the studies reported below. We conveniently maintained spheroids in the same 384-microwell plate used for spheroid formation by robotic exchange of culture medium.(A\u2013B) Cancer cells remain confined in the 0.3 \u00b5l DEX phase drop (purple) suspended in the immiscible immersion PEG phase (pink) and autonomously aggregate to form a co-culture spheroid of triple negative breast cancer cells (green) and human mammary fibroblasts (red) in 48 hrs. Colors in panel (A) are for presentation purpose only. (C) Resulting spheroids of different co-culture models are consistently sized with low standard errors.Effect of TNBC-stromal cells signaling on cellular metabolic activity of spheroidsTo investigate the effect of CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and/or CXCR7 receptors on the proliferation of cells in 3D cultures, we generated eight different co-culture spheroids that contained at least one element of this chemokine-receptor(s) signaling or completely lacked them: (i) TNBC:HMF, (ii) TNBC:CAFs, (iii) CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, (iv) CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, (v) CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, (vi) CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, (vii) CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and (viii) CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. The co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF that lacked this signaling served as the global negative control. Spheroids were evaluated for their cellular proliferation over a six-day period following formation and in medium containing only 1% FBS at the starting point and no renewal (Figure 2A). The TNBC:CAFs model displayed either a lower or fairly similar activity compared to the TNBC:HMF model, indicating that CXCL12 production by CAFs does not confer growth advantage to TNBC cells lacking the cognate receptors of the chemokine. On the other hand, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model showed overall the highest and continuously increasing activity throughout the culture compared to all the other co-culture spheroids. The CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model also consistently showed 11\u201328% greater activity than its CXCR4+TNBC:HMF counterpart lacking the CXCL12 chemokine as determined by a linear regression analysis. There was no significant difference between cell proliferation in CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids. Interestingly, these models even had lower activity level than the TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs spheroids on each day of measurement. When the effect of expression of both CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cell proliferation was evaluated, the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs model had slightly increased activity, up to 4.5%, than the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF spheroids on certain days. Our statistical analysis of the multivariate, temporally-dependent data resulting from all eight co-culture spheroid models showed that cell proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was significantly different from the seven other models across the six-day culture period (Figure 2B).(A) Growth of co-culture spheroids based on metabolic activity measurements is shown over a six-day period. Spheroids consist of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells at a ratio of 1:2 TNBC:fibroblasts at the starting point of experiments. (B) p-values from a statistical test show that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model is consistently and significantly more proliferative than all the other models.Consistent with reports in mouse models, our finding suggests that the CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 axis is a key mediator of cell proliferation in breast cancer. The effect of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling on promoting primary and metastatic breast tumor growth has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies. Several studies have reported that CXCR7 is a scavenger receptor to prevent saturation of CXCR4 receptors and also to create CXCL12 gradients to facilitate migration of CXCR4+ cancer cells. This provides a plausible explanation for the similar activity levels of the CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture models. We note that the role of the CXCR7 receptor in the presence of CXCL12 signaling remains disputed. For example, studies show that CXCR7 expression lead to growth of primary breast tumors in rat models through promoting angiogenesis, which is consistent with data showing upregulation of this receptor on tumor vasculature. However, results from these studies cannot be correlated with those from our 3D cultures that represent models of avascular tumors. Altogether, these data demonstrate that our 3D cultures recapitulate growth properties of breast tumors. Based on analysis of the data, we selected the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and its respective negative control, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, for mechanistic studies of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling in TNBC.Inhibition and stimulation of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingWe conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate if the higher proliferative activity of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was indeed due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling. The experiments included an inhibition test and a stimulation test. First, we treated spheroids with AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 that blocks the CXCR4 receptor. Consistently throughout the six-day culture, this treatment reduced proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model that lacks CXCL12 (Figure 3A). Next, we treated the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium of CAFs. This stimulation elevated the proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 3B). In both cases, our analysis showed minimal statistically significant differences between the treated and non-treated co-culture models. Collectively, these results established that greater proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model than the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroid model was due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling.(A) Treatment of CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids with AMD3100 (CXCR4 antagonist) normalizes proliferation to level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture. (B) Treating CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium from CAFs stimulates proliferation to that of CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids.Evaluation of cancer cell growth in spheroids due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingThe above study based on metabolic activity of cells provided a measure of stromal-cancer cells signaling effect on the overall growth of spheroids. Considering that activated stromal cells (CAFs) in breast tumors also proliferate, we investigated to what extent greater overall growth results from proliferation of CXCR4+ TNBC cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids compared with other spheroid models shown in Figure 2A. Measurements of the endogenous eGFP signal of the cancer cells showed that cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display a statistically significant (p < 0.05) growth increase throughout the measurement window (Figure 4A). Linear regression analysis showed that CXCR4+TNBC cells in this model had an 11.4% larger growth slope over time than their counterparts in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. This indicates that CAFs confer increasingly greater proliferative activity to the breast cancer cells. To validate this result, we evaluated growth of cancer cells in co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs that lacked both elements of the signaling axis or CXCR4 receptor expression, respectively. Despite some random differences in growth of cancer cells between the two models on several days, the slope of linear regression was smaller by 2% in the co-culture containing CAFs (Figure 4B). Thus, these results established the role of CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling on enhanced growth of breast cancer cells.Proliferation of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids measured using their endogenous eGFP signal(A) TNBC cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display consistently greater proliferation compared to spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture model and CXCR4+TNBC single culture with a larger slope of 11.4% and 77.1%, respectively. (B) TNBC cells lacking CXCR4 expression in co-culture with HMF and CAFs show a similar proliferation. (C\u2013D) Morphology of resulting co-culture spheroids and mono-culture spheroids of breast cancer cells on days 1, 3, and 6 (left to right). Error bars represent standard error of mean. (E\u2013F) Confocal images of the co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells on day 4. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.TNBC cells in all four co-culture spheroid models displayed a larger growth than their respective mono-culture spheroids generated with the same density of 5 \u00d7 103 breast cancer cells. The slope of linear regression of growth curves was 5.0 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and TNBC:CAFs co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. Similarly, the regression line slope was 4.4 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and TNBC:HMF co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. This implies a major role for heterotypic cellular signaling in tumors and suggests that breast cancer cells induce the normal fibroblasts to produce soluble factors to promote growth of malignant cells. Studies show that cancer cells produce growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) that activate the adjacent stromal cells, which in turn secrete signaling molecules such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to promote proliferation of cancer cells. The larger growth rate of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids compared to the respective CXCR4+TNBC mono-culture spheroids may be mediated by soluble factors secreted by CXCR4-expressing cancer cells to transform HMF cells to CAFs.Morphologically, mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and TNBC became more compact by day six of culture. Co-culturing breast cancer cells and fibroblasts significantly enhanced compactness of spheroids earlier, indicating that fibroblasts facilitate spheroid formation of breast cancer cells (Figure 4C\u20134D). The co-culture models containing CXCR4+TNBC cells exhibited a compact morphology for several days with minimal increases of volume (9\u201315%) from days 1 to 3. But over time, the co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and HMF cells showed separation of fibroblast and cancer cells with an 82% volume increase from days 3 to 6. This is likely due to the expression of incompatible junctional proteins in breast cancer and fibroblast cells. For example, it was shown that intercellular adhesion was dependent on cadherins expression of each cell type, and only cells that expressed the same type of cadherins intermixed. Notably, the separation behavior was observed considerably more in the TNBC:HMF co-culture model and was further demonstrated through confocal imaging in Figure 4E\u20134F. Expression of CXCR4 on TNBC cells largely prevented separation from HMF cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. Additionally, inclusion of CAFs, regardless of CXCR4 expression on TNBC cells, blocked the segregation effect and helped the spheroids retain a compact morphology, mimicking the unique characteristic of CAFs to infiltrate tumor masses. All spheroids displayed shedding of TNBC cells from their peripheries on later days of culture, suggesting that active proliferation of border cells is somewhat compensated by cell shedding. We note that a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these morphological differences in co-culture spheroids requires a more extensive analysis.Molecular analysis of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on cancer cell proliferation in spheroidsWe evaluated proliferation of both breast cancer and stromal cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids using IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids and quantifying Ki-67+ proliferative cells. Breast cancer and stromal cells showed statistically significant higher proliferation (p < 0.05) in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 5). When co-cultured with CAFs, the CXCR4+TNBC cells showed 1.4 times greater Ki-67 staining, in agreement with results based on eGFP signal measurements (Figure 4). Additionally, CAFs in the co-culture model had a remarkably two-fold higher Ki-67 staining compared to HMF cells. This is consistent with increased proliferation of CAFs in tumor tissues, and the overall greater stromal content in more aggressive and larger tumors. We note that the CAFs secrete mCherry-tagged CXCL12 into the medium, whereas the HMF cells contain mCherry signal in their nuclei. This is the reason for visual differences between the red fluorescence images of CAFs and HMF cells in Figure 5. To avoid relying on the mCherry signal for quantification of cell proliferation, we used the Ki-67+ and eGFP signal of breast cancer cells to quantify proliferative TNBC cells, and then subtracted this value from the total Ki-67+ fluorescence to quantify proliferation of stromal cells (CAFs or HMF) in their respective co-cultures.Proliferation of CXCR4+TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HMF and CAFs) in co-culture spheroids characterized through measurements of Ki-67+ proliferative cells using immunostained images of cryosections of 4-day old spheroids. Both cancer cells and fibroblasts show significantly greater proliferation in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model (blue bars). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Next, we investigated molecular mechanisms for increased proliferation of stromal and breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 axis may activate multiple pathways in cancer cells. We focused on ERK and AKT, two prominent drivers of proliferation in breast cancer and other malignancies. Western blot analysis relative to the total protein and \u03b2-actin expression of each co-culture system showed that cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids had moderately higher levels of p-ERK (Figure 6A) and substantially higher levels of p-AKT (Figure 6B) compared to CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. The displayed immunoblots were quantified (normalized to their respective total and \u03b2-actin protein expressions), showing an 81% increase in the p-AKT/t-AKT levels and a 16% increase in p-ERK/t-ERK levels in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids. Although p-ERK increase is modest, small changes in activation of MAPK components produce much larger effects on overall signaling and biologic outputs. These results suggest that the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling upregulates activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways to support TNBC cells metabolic and growth activities.Western blot analysis of signaling proteins (A) p-ERK and (B) p-AKT in co-cultures of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF and CAFs. Quantified data were normalized to \u03b2-actin protein expression.To further substantiate these results, we conducted IHC analysis of cryosections of co-culture spheroids for ERK and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 7A\u20137B, 7D\u20137E). Quantification of immunostained sections (normalized to total protein expression and highest fluorescent value obtained) showed a similar pattern to Western blotting with a 52% and 28% increase in p-AKT/t-AKT and p-ERK/t-ERK levels, respectively, in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 7C, 7F). We note that high levels of ERK and AKT at the periphery of immunostained sections is due to the positioning of CXCR4+TNBC cells at the periphery of the co-culture spheroids. Fibroblasts were mainly distributed in the center of the sections and showed minimal staining, clear from the composite image in Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Movie 1. Therefore, quantification was only performed on the CXCR4+TNBC cells of stained sections.Cryosections of co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (green) with HMF and CAFs immunostained for (A\u2013B) ERK and (D\u2013E) AKT. A blue fluorescent secondary antibody was used to detect ERK and AKT. Images represent spheroids on day 4 of culture. Quantification showed higher (C) ERK and (F) AKT phosphorylation in the CXCR4+TNBC cells when co-cultured with CAFs. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Drug sensitivity of stromal-cancer cells co-culture spheroidsBiochemical interactions of activated stromal cells and cancer cells are suggested as a major cause of drug resistance. To demonstrate the effect of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on drug response of breast cancer cells, we evaluated the sensitivity of co-culture spheroids to a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, to which TNBC patients may develop resistance. Cancer cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids were significantly more resistant to paclitaxel at a 0.1\u201310 nM concentration range than cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids (p < 0.01). The largest difference in cancer cell viability (36%) occurred at a drug concentration of 1 nM (Figure 8). This demonstrates the impact of activated tumor stromal cells on chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells, consistent with several other reports, and that our 3D tumor models recapitulate stromal-mediated drug resistance. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 eliminated resistance to paclitaxel of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model. This result emphasizes the potential to improve response to chemotherapy by targeting the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling.CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids (blue bars) display resistance to paclitaxel treatment but lose resistance to the drug when co-treated with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 (gray bars), similar to the negative control counterpart (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). Images reflect spheroids at the end of drug treatment period (6 days). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.01.To understand the mechanism of paclitaxel resistance, we performed IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids to assess ERK and AKT activity in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF models treated with 1 nM paclitaxel. Following treatment, significantly higher phosphorylation levels of both proteins were maintained in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (p < 0.05), indicating that resistance to paclitaxel due to the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling is mediated by activation of these kinase pathways (Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure 3). Previous studies showed that paclitaxel resistance strongly correlated with increased activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in breast cancers, supporting our data. Upon co-treatment of spheroids with 1 \u03bcM of AMD3100, phosphorylated levels of ERK and AKT in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model treated with paclitaxel normalized to that of control CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. These results collectively demonstrate the promising therapeutic approach of sensitizing TNBC tumors to chemotherapy treatment by disrupting the cancer-stroma signaling and its downstream pathways to overcome stroma-induced cancer cell growth and chemotherapy resistance.Immunohistochemical analysis of drug-treated spheroids indicates that increases in AKT and ERK phosphorylation levels in CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids contribute to paclitaxel resistance (blue bars). Co-treatment with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist, AMD3100, lowers AKT and ERK activities (gray bars) to that observed in the paclitaxel sensitive control culture (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). *p < 0.05.Our findings suggest that greater proliferation and drug resistance of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model is due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling through AKT and ERK. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of these kinase pathways may block enhanced growth of cancer cells and compromise their viability. We treated both co-culture spheroids with specific inhibitors of MEK/ERK (PD0325901) and PI3K/AKT (PI-103) at a wide concentration range for a six-day period. Effectiveness of the inhibitors was assessed by eGFP detection of breast cancer cells in treated groups relative to their respective negative control group (no treatment) and presented as percent cell viability. We found that breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model were more sensitive to PD0325901 treatment below 100 nM (Figure 10A) and PI-103 treatment below 1 \u00b5M (Figure 10B). We further confirmed the reduction in breast cancer cell viability using quantification of fluorescence images of drug-treated spheroids in Figure 10C\u201310D. The largest differences in the viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs and HMF were 23% and 27% at 1 nM of PD0325901 and 0.1 nM of PI-103, respectively. Interestingly, PI-103 at a 0.1 nM concentration reduced breast cancer cell viability in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to 56%. This was consistent with protein expression results that showed significant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Figure 6 and 7) leads to increased growth of the breast cancer cells (Figure 4). This also agrees with a study that showed CXCL12 signaling-mediated drug resistant cancer cells became substantially more sensitive to chemotherapy through AKT inhibition. At higher concentrations, the MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor is more effective and reduces the cancer cells viability to less than 10%. Overall, the results corroborate our protein expression study that showed upregulated activity of these two kinase pathways due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling. Although CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 can potentially activate multiple pathways in cancer cells, these results establish signaling to MAPK and PI3K pathways in TNBC cells and the promising result of targeting these pathways to improve cytotoxicity. Considering the activation of both kinase pathways due to this signaling, their simultaneous inhibition using combination treatments with specific molecular inhibitors of AKT and MAPK pathways may result in synergistic inhibition of TNBC cell growth and survival at lower drug concentrations than those with single-agent treatments. Collectively, these results strongly support the utility of our 3D tumor models for cellular and molecular studies of tumor-stromal interactions.Viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with HMF and CAFs treated with a MEK inhibitor, (A) PD0325901, and a PI3K inhibitor, (B) PI-103, measured using the endogenous eGFP signal of the TNBC cells. CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs show greater drug sensitivity to the molecular inhibitors. Images reflect spheroids at end of drug treatment period (5 days). Error bars represent standard error of mean. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.In conclusion, our robotic technology allowed facile generation of co-culture spheroids to conveniently study stromal-cancer (TNBC) cells interactions. We found that CXCL12 from CAFs signaled through CXCR4 on triple negative cancer cells to significantly enhance TNBC cell proliferation. Additionally, CAFs showed greater proliferation than their normal HMF counterpart. Increased proliferation of TNBC cells occurred due to activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, two known effectors of CXCR4 signaling. CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling also conferred resistance to chemotherapy. We demonstrated the potential to overcome stromal-mediated drug resistance using small molecule inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways and CXCR4 signaling. Altogether, these findings highlight the power of our model system to identify promising new therapeutic strategies to improve response to therapy in TNBC. Future studies with improved tumor models should address and distinguish effects of stromal cells-deposited ECM signaling and stromal cells-mediated biochemical signaling with cancer cells on the proliferation and drug response of cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) preparationTwo polymers, BioUltra polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Sigma), MW: 35 kDa, and dextran (DEX) (Pharmacosmos), MW: 500 kDa, were utilized to form an aqueous two-phase system, as described previously. Briefly, PEG and DEX were added to the complete cell culture medium at 5.0% (w/v) and 12.8% (w/v), respectively. The polymers were dissolved using a vortex mixer and then incubating in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The polymer solutions were then stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Prior to use, the PEG phase polymer solution was filtered by passing it through a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter to remove any impurities.Cell cultureThree different triple negative breast cancer cells were utilized for experiments. The cell lines were: MDA-MB-231 (labeled TNBC), MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR4 receptor (labeled CXCR4+TNBC), and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR7 receptor (labeled CXCR7+TNBC). These cells were previously stably transduced using lentiviral vectors and the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cancer cells was confirmed through flow cytometry. The TNBC cells were additionally stably transduced to express eGFP for detection. In addition, a human mammary fibroblast (HMF) cell line (labeled HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein was utilized. HMF cells were also stably transduced to secrete 0.75 ng/ml/hr of CXCL12-\u03b1 fused with mCherry for tracking, and the resulting cells were labeled as CAFs. CAFs extracted from breast cancer patients secreted varying amounts of CXCL12 in media ranging from 0.9 ng/ml \u2013 2 ng/ml over a 48 hr time period, depending on the patients and the tumor samples. The higher CXCL12 secretion rate of our transduced HMFs accounts for medium renewals and drug additions that consequently dilute the CXCL12 concentration in the medium. To maintain the cells in culture, they were grown in T175 flasks at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 using Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). Once a confluent monolayer formed, cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma) and dissociated using 5 ml trypsin (Life Technologies) in an incubator for \u223c2 min. The cells were then neutralized with 10 ml of the complete growth medium, collected, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was aspirated, cells were resupsended in 1 ml of fresh medium, and loaded into a hemocytometer for counting.Co-culture spheroid formation using aqueous two-phase system (ATPS)A ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells was used to form co-culture spheroids that model the high stromal content often observed in larger and more advanced human breast tumors. Our initial tests with 1:3 and 1:4 ratios (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial TNBC cell density constant did not make any further changes in the growth of cancer cells. Therefore, the selected ratio of 1:2 (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) was used for all the studies. To prepare for forming spheroids, 30 \u03bcl of the PEG phase solution was dispensed into each well of a 384-well plate, labeled as the destination plate. The DEX phase solution was mixed at an equal volume with a specific density of cells (1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monoculture spheroids of TNBC cells, 2 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monocultures spheroids of HMF and CAFs, and 3 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF and TNBC-CAFs). The DEX phase solution and the cell suspension became diluted in half upon mixing resulting in a final polymer concentration of 6.4% (w/v), and densities of 5 \u00d7 103/0.3 \u03bcl TNBC cells in monoculture spheroids, 1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl HMF cells or CAFs in monoculture spheroids, and 1.5 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl in co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF cells or TNBC-CAFs. A source 384-well plate was prepared by loading the wells from a single column with \u223c20 \u03bcl of the solution of mixed DEX phase and cell suspension. A robotic liquid handler (Bravo SRT, Agilent) was programmed to mix the source plate content and aspirate 0.3 \u03bcl from each well. This solution was robotically dispensed as a single drop into each well of the destination plate containing the PEG phase. This process was repeated for all columns of the destination plate. After completion, the destination plate was placed in an incubator to allow cells to aggregate into a single spheroid in each well within 48 hrs. Our studies used a total of eight co-culture models: TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC: HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. Images of co-culture spheroids were captured using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) equipped with a high-resolution camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss).Robotic media exchange of co-culture spheroidsAfter forming spheroids, the cell culture medium in microwells was robotically exchanged to fresh medium containing only \u223c1% FBS. This was to ensure minimizing the effect of serum on cell growth and capture the effect of paracrine stromal-cancer cells signaling. The medium exchange was performed by three consecutive robotic dispensing and aspirating of 40 \u03bcl of the medium containing 1% FBS. This reduced the FBS concentration in the microwells from that of the complete growth medium to a very low level of \u223c1%. Therefore, the co-culture spheroids were maintained in \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of experiments. The medium exchange also diluted the PEG and DEX polymer concentrations and resulted in a single medium phase. The ATPS was not necessary at this point as it was only used for spheroid formation. The liquid handling protocol was optimized to avoid loss of spheroids during the process of medium exchange. Following this step, spheroids remained in 70 \u03bcl of homogenous \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of culture and without any further medium exchange.Evaluation of metabolic activity of co-culture spheroidsThe growth of co-culture spheroids was evaluated for a six-day period for all eight co-culture models using a standard PrestoBlue metabolic activity assay (Invitrogen). The PrestoBlue reagent contains a resazurin compound that is reduced by metabolically active, viable cells to resorufin detectable with standard plate readers at excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively. We have previously optimized the PrestoBlue assay for use with spheroid cultures. The resulting raw fluorescence data from all eight co-culture spheroids were normalized to the highest fluorescent readout obtained in the experimental data over the six-day period. Data from replicates (n = 14) of each co-culture model were then averaged and statistically evaluated to select certain co-culture models for further studies.Statistical analysis of growth of co-culture spheroidsStatistical analysis was performed on the metabolic activity of co-culture models using a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Briefly, the data represented measured signals from eight different co-culture models over six days. For each model on each day, there were 14 experimental replicates that were repeatedly used over the six-day measurement period. Therefore, we selected one-way MANOVA for data analysis to account for the temporal dependency of the daily measurements with each spheroid from a given co-culture model. The data were tested in two steps: (i) to evaluate if a co-culture model was statistically different from the other models. This was done by testing the null hypothesis that none of the co-cultures was different from the other models; and (ii) to identify if the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was statistically different from the other seven models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs). This was done using seven pairwise comparisons to test the null hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model was not different from the other models.The first statistical test showed significant differences among the eight co-culture models. Next, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was selected for pairwise comparisons with the other seven models due to its higher levels of proliferation. We determined if greater proliferation in this model was statistically significant from the other co-cultures. The Bonferroni correction was utilized to control the family-wise error since this was a multiple testing problem. A significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05 was selected to determine significant differences between the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and every other co-culture model. But \u03b1 was first modified to \u03b1/m, where m accounts for the number of hypotheses made. In this analysis, the number of hypotheses was m = 7. Therefore, a corrected significance level of 0.007 was used to reject the hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was not different from all the other seven co-cultures.For experiments that contained only two or three co-culture models presented in other sections, a student\u2019s t-test in Microsoft Excel Software or two-way ANOVA in Minitab Software was utilized with a p < 0.05 representing statistical significance.Blocking and stimulating chemokine-receptor signaling in co-culture spheroidsTo further evaluate cell proliferation due to chemokine-receptor signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids, AMD3100 (Selleckchem) was used to block the signaling and CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium was used to stimulate the signaling. A stock solution of AMD3100 was prepared in distilled, sterile water at 5 mM and stored at \u201380\u00b0C according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The desired concentration of AMD3100 was prepared by serially diluting the stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After formation of spheroids in the PEG-DEX ATPS, the medium exchange was done by adding 40 \u03bcl of AMD3100 at a 1.75 \u03bcM concentration to wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of medium. This diluted AMD3100 concentration to 1 \u03bcM. The AMD3100 solution was renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh solution of AMD3100 at a 1 \u03bcM concentration.To induce signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids, the spheroids were treated with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium collected from a confluent monolayer of CAFs. The conditioned medium was extracted from the CAFs monolayer 24 hours after seeding to ensure that it contained high levels of nutrients and growth factors. The conditioned medium was added to co-culture spheroids through medium exchange and renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh conditioned medium. Metabolic activity of co-culture spheroids following inhibition (AMD3100 treatment) or stimulation (CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium treatment) was evaluated daily using PrestoBlue over the six-day culture period. Data were compared to the respective negative controls, i.e., co-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF for inhibition and CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs for stimulation) that were grown in 70 \u03bcl of 1% FBS-containing media without receiving any treatment. Daily measured raw data from the co-culture models over the six-day culture were normalized to the highest fluorescent value obtained and then used for statistical tests.TNBC cell growth in co-culture spheroidsThe growth of TNBC cells in the co-culture models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs) that were selected based on the metabolic activity analysis was further confirmed by measuring the endogenous eGFP in TNBC cells using a plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The results were compared to those of the monoculture spheroids (TNBC and CXCR4+TNBC). Each model had n = 14 replicates. Data from each model were normalized to an arbitrary fluorescent value of 8000 a.u. for ease of comparison among different groups. Background fluorescence from the mCherry-expressing stromal cells in the co-culture spheroids was subtracted from the measured signal of TNBC cells. Fluorescent images were captured using a confocal microscope (Fluoview, FV1000, Olympus).Immunostaining and quantification of proliferation of co-culture spheroidsTo validate and quantify cell proliferation of co-culture spheroids, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an established protocol. Co-culture spheroids were aspirated from microwells on day four and collected in 200 \u03bcl microcentrifuge tubes. Medium used for transferring spheroids was carefully removed from the microcentrifuge tubes and 100 \u03bcl of 4% formaldehyde was added to fix the spheroids for 10 minutes at room temperature. The spheroids were rinsed with 100 \u03bcl of PBS three times for 5 minutes to remove the formaldehyde. A 30% (w/v) sucrose solution was then added to remove water from spheroids and prevent crystal formation upon freezing. Once spheroids sank to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes, an equal volume (100 \u03bcl) of tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences) was added to each tube. Samples were kept at 4\u00b0C overnight. Frozen samples were prepared the following day by flash-freezing spheroids into biopsy-sized cryomolds with dry ice. The spheroids were embedded between two thin layers of tissue freezing medium while avoiding bubble formation. The frozen molds containing the spheroids were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.A cryostat (Leica CM 1850) was used to cryosection the spheroids to 10 \u03bcm-thick slices. Only the middle sections of spheroids were collected and assessed. Each slice was transferred onto Superfrost Plus microscopic slides (Fisher). The sections were stained using a standard immunostaining protocol with primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling including the proliferative cell marker Ki-67, phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan). A blue fluorescent secondary antibody (AMCA-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for detection to avoid interfering with the endogenous mCherry and eGFP signals in the stromal and TNBC cells, respectively. The endogenous eGFP fluorescence of TNBC cells was used to distinguish TNBC and stromal cells. An inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) was used to capture fluorescent images. Image processing and analysis were performed in ImageJ Software (NIH) to quantify expression of each blue-labeled protein. The TNBC cells of sections were found through binary conversion of the green channel images to select and outline only the eGFP-expressing TNBC cells. This TNBC cell outline was then overlaid on the blue channel images to measure the mean gray value of protein-expressing TNBC cells. For Ki-67 analysis, this value was then subtracted from the total mean gray value of blue channel images to determine the mean gray value of Ki-67+ stromal cells.Western blot analysis with spheroidsCo-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF) were harvested from microplates on day four and transferred into 50 mL conical tubes. After centrifuging down the samples, the supernatant was removed and spheroids were washed with PBS. Spheroids were lysed using 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer (50 mM tric-HCL, 150 mM NaCl 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4 \u00b1 0.2), a protease inhibitor (complete mini, Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitor (Life Technologies). Spheroids were sonicated (Vibra-Cell, Sonics) twice for five seconds at a 50% amplitude level to ensure complete lysis. A BCA quantification assay kit (Life Technologies) was then used to quantify the total protein concentration extracted from spheroids. Electrophoresis and electroblotting were performed by protein addition (20 \u03bcl) onto a 4\u201315% gel (Biorad) and then gel transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma) for 1 hour. Primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling for phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan) were prepared at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer, and incubated with membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour. The membranes were thoroughly washed prior to and following secondary antibody treatment and detected with an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) using a FluorChem E imaging system (ProteinSimple). Quantified protein expression data were normalized to their corresponding \u03b2-actin expression.Chemotherapy drug testing with co-culture spheroidsBoth CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids were subjected to (i) single treatment with a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel (Selleckchem), and (ii) co-treatment with paclitaxel and AMD3100, to evaluate drug responses of TNBC cells. A stock solution of paclitaxel was prepared in DMSO at a 23 mM concentration and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. For single drug treatment, paclitaxel drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 2X the desired concentration. The drug solutions were added to co-culture spheroids, resulting in a total media volume of 70 \u03bcl and diluting the drug concentration in half. For co-treatment of spheroids with paclitaxel and AMD3100, drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 3.5X the desired concentration and directly added (20 \u03bcl of each drug solution) to co-culture spheroids in wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of media. Paclitaxel was added at a wide range of concentrations (0.01 \u2013 1000 nM) while AMD3100 was used at a constant 1 \u03bcM concentration for co-treatments. Single-agent (paclitaxel) and co-treatment (paclitaxel and AMD3100) tests were conducted for six days. A small volume (5 \u03bcl) of concentrated AMD3100 (15 \u03bcM) was directly added to the co-treated spheroid cultures after 72 hrs of incubation to provide a fresh dose of 1 \u03bcM AMD3100. Each condition in drug treatment studies used 14 spheroids. After six days, the TNBC cell viability of drug treated co-culture spheroids was evaluated using their endogenous eGFP fluorescence. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to the respective negative control conditions (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability.Preparation of inhibitors and testing against co-culture spheroidsThe CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and CXCR4+TNBC: CAFs spheroids were treated with a MEK inhibitor, PD0325901 (Selleckchem), and a PI3K inhibitor, PI-103 (Selleckchem). Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared at a 50 mM concentration in DMSO and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. The desired inhibitor concentrations for experiments were prepared by serially diluting each stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After forming co-culture spheroids, the medium exchange was performed as previously described and 30 \u03bcl of an inhibitor solution (prepared at 2X desired concentration) was added to spheroids in the last renewal stage, diluting the inhibitor concentrations in half. A column of spheroids was left untreated and only received 30 \u03bcl of fresh 1% FBS-containing medium. Spheroids were incubated for 72 hrs and then treatments were renewed by direct addition of 30 \u03bcl of fresh inhibitor solutions (prepared at 1X desired concentration). The negative control conditions received 1% FBS-containing medium. The spheroids were incubated for an additional 48 hrs and viable TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids were detected using their endogenous eGFP with a plate reader. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to their respective negative controls (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability. The results obtained from plate reading were further confirmed by fluorescent microscopy (Axio Observer, Zeiss) followed by image analysis (ImageJ, NIH).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

Chemotherapy is one of the cornerstone treatments in patients with breast cancer, which overall improves breast cancer outcome by 5\u201310% in patients with node negative disease. However, its use is increasingly affected by chemotherapy resistance and lack of effective predictors. Recently, emerging evidences have suggested that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could contribute to chemotherapy resistances in breast cancer treatment. As the most frequent component of stroma cells in tumor microenvironment, CAFs have been assumed to play an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of breast cancer. Moreover, Farmer et al. reported that increased stromal gene expression predicts resistance to preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC), suggesting that stroma activation could be involved in chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, it was shown that CAFs mediated resistance to chemotherapy by releasing collagen I. Loeffler et al. have developed a vaccine that could target CAFs and allow reversing resistance to chemotherapy.Considering the interaction between CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, it would be reasonable that chemotherapy-induced damage could have an impact on CAFs and change the expression of some relevant factors, which could participate in chemotherapy resistance. In our study, we have cultured CAFs which were derived from surgically resected primary breast cancers and compared the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy. The goal will be to find candidate markers from tumor microenvironment that associate with breast cancer chemotherapy resistance and discuss the possibility that these markers could be used as predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and feasible for targeted therapy.Materials and Methods1. Ethics StatementThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Written informed consent for using the samples for research purposes was obtained from all patients prior to surgery.2. Cell Culture of CAFs and Breast Cancer Cell LineTissues for primary cultures of CAFs were collected from 10 breast cancer patients who underwent complete surgical resection of their tumors at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Only tissues in excess of those required for clinical diagnoses were harvested for this study. Harvested tissues were placed in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen Corporation) for immediate transportation on ice to the laboratory. Tissues were minced into small pieces, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and digested for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in prepared reagent containing collagenase type I and Hyaluronidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell suspension was filtrated with 100 mesh screen and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and then the pellet was resuspended in the fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cell counting was performed with the Beckman Coulter Cell and Particle Counter Z1. The population doubling was estimated based on the increase in cell number counted at each passage time. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as the breast cancer cell line, according to the normal procedure (Sigma-Aldrich).3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)Primary antibodies for immunostaining included multi-cytokeratin (CK), Vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), CD34, and TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) (Labvision). CAFs were seeded in chamber slides and fixed in cold acetone. After antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous peroxidase in 3% hydrogen peroxide, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature in a moist chamber for 60 min. Specific signals were visualized by incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 min, followed by incubation with 3,3/-diaminobenzidine (DAB) used as a chromogen to create brown staining. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 min, and the slides were coverslipped.4. Flow Cytometry (FCM)CAFs were collected and prepared as a single cell suspension by mechanical blowing with PBS at the concentration of 1\u00d7105/ml. The expression of CD34 and CD45 (MACS) was detected using FCM (FACSC alibar; BD).5. Cell Adhesion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber (Transwell; Corning). For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere (Sanofi). Afterwards, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, until confluent. Matrigel (BD) was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and then 100 \u00b5l matrigel was added to each well in new 24-well plates. Two groups of MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and transferred to 24-well plates coated with matrigel. After incubation for 1 h, MDA-MB-231 cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of MDA-MB-231 cells that adhered to the bottom of coated wells was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.6. Invasion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. Matrigel was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and 50 \u00b5l/cm2 matrigel was added to each filter. The filters were placed in 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were added to each upper chamber, and CAFs were added to the lower chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed with a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.7. Proliferation Assay (MTT)The harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were treated with 0 ng/ml, 4 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml Taxotere, respectively. Then the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. Assays were initiated by adding 100 \u00b5l MTT (2 mg/ml) to each well and incubating the cells for an additional 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterwards, the medium was removed and 1 ml dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. Finally, the supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates in triplicate, which were read at a wavelength of 550 nm with a Thermo Scientific Multiskan\u00ae Spectrum.8. mRNA Expression ProfilingTotally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). Total RNA was extracted from all cultured CAFs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Microarray studies were performed by Capital Medical University Microarray Centre, using Illumina humanHT-12 v4 expression BeadChip based on Illumina BeadStation500. The biotinylated cRNA preparation, hybridization, and scanning of microarrays were done according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Biological replicates have been used to reduce errors. Illumina Gene Expression Beaderchips have internal control features to monitor data quality. The GenomeStudio software (Ilumina) calculates and reports a detection p-value, which determines whether a transcript on the array is called detected. In our study, a detection p-value below the threshold of 0.01 indicated that a gene could be considered as expressed. Differentially expressed genes in CAFs before chemotherapy vs. after chemotherapy were also identified and analyzed with GenomeStudio. The output was filtered to include genes whose expression was altered at least two-fold. The dataset of the microarray analysis has been deposited in ArrayExpress, with the accession number E-MTAB-1614.9. Real-Time PCRReal-Time PCR was performed to confirm differential gene expression in cultured CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h), using BIO-RAD IQ5 Real-Time PCR System. cDNA was synthesized using 1 \u00b5g total RNA, oligo (dT), and Superscript\u2122 III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Synthesis was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All the primers were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) for thecandidate genes. Predicted PCR product sequences were verified by using BLAST for recognition of target and non-target sequences.10. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc). Student\u2019s t test was used to test for statistical significance. Data were presented as the mean\u00b1standard error. p<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.Results1. Characterization of Primary-cultured CAFsBy using a study protocol approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board, CAFs were cultured from 10 surgically resected primary breast cancers which were histologically confirmed. The cultured cells were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. The morphological and immunohistochemical pictures of CAFs were represented in Figure 1A. Additionally, FCM showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs (Figure 1B).Characterization of primary-cultured CAFs.A showed the cultured cells which were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. B showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs with FCM.2. CAFs Promotes the Function of Breast Cancer Cells after ChemotherapyWe assumed that chemotherapy-induced damage interacted with tumor microenvironment and hence compared the function of MDA-MB-231 cells after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere) co-cultured with CAFs and that without CAFs. By using cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. The representative pictures of cell functional studies were shown in Figure 2.The function comparison of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, when treated with Taxotere.By using cell adhesion assay (A), invasion assay (B), and MTT assay (C), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with cells without co-culture.3. Comparison of Gene Expression Profiling in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyTotally 24314 expressed genes were detected in the microarray assay and 35 differentially expressed genes were identified (absolute fold change >2) between CAFs after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were summarized in Table S1 and Figure 3A with clustering analysis. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity (Figure 3B). The differentially expressed genes were also annotated in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion (hsa04510), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton (hsa04810), and MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010).Hierarchical clustering of gene analysis expression and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere).A showed the Heatmap plot of scaled gene-expression levels. The first 6 columns marked with \u201c1\u201d on top have represented the samples untreated with Taxotere, while the following 6 columns marked with \u201c2\u201d have represented the samples treated with Taxotere. Rows are genes with mean fold change between CAFs before and after chemotherapy. B and C revealed that these genes including up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity through GO analysis.4. Differential Expression of Candidate Genes in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyWe have picked up 6 genes from 35 differential genes and confirmed the different gene expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) via Real-Time PCR, using triplicate samples. The candidate genes included up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05). The pictures were represented in Figure 4.Differential expression of candidate genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy.The candidate genes were picked up from 35 differential genes, including up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. The differential expression of 6 genes in three pairs of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) was confirmed by Real-Time PCR. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05).DiscussionAs is known, cancer is a systemic disease encompassing multiple components of both tumor cells themselves and tumor microenvironment. The notion is now widely accepted that the development and progression of cancer highly depends on the interactions between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Recently, many investigations have pointed to stromal cells as the major regulator in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast cancers. However, the origin of CAFs has been a debate. Based on different theories, CAFs might arise from activated resident fibroblasts, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, cancer cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or other undetermined mechanisms. Correspondingly, CAFs were reported to exhibit different expression of multiple biomarkers such \u03b1-SMA, FSP-1, FAP, platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b1), platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b2), vimentin, CAV-1, PTEN, p21, or TP53 mutation. According to our study, CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) and negative expression of CK, CD34, as well as CD45, suggesting that these primary-cultured CAFs were more likely to arise from activated resident fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cells, endothelial cells or bone marrow. We are aware that the observation based on morphological characteristics is just weak evidence for explaining the origin hypothesis, which needs further and more fundamental studies. Moreover, our data showed that CAFs could promote the adhesion, invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells, which was consistent with peer researches.Breast cancer is known as the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been considered as an effective way which could improve the outcomes especially in patients with advanced and inflammatory diseases. However, the resistance of tumor cells to a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs and lack of useful predictive markers of response to NAC continue to be problems. Though the precise nature and molecular mechanism of chemotherapy resistance is still unclear, many current studies have focused on identifying novel predictors of chemotherapy efficiency. CAFs merit attention, in consideration of frequent association with chemotherapy resistance. Sonnenberg et al. reported highly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in CAFs from lung and breast, which could explain some levels of resistance in stroma-positive tumors where stroma would not be sensitive to chemotherapy. Furthermore, an oral DNA vaccine targeting fibroblasts activation protein (FAP) was developed to suppress primary tumor cell growth and metastasis of multidrug-resistant murine breast carcinoma and allowed reversing resistance to chemotherapy, by increasing intratumoral drug uptake. Based on our data, the comparison of gene expression profiling between CAFs before and after chemotherapy indicated the solid gene changes and provided candidate markers that might participate in chemotherapy resistance. Considering the correlation of breast cancer treatment and tumor microenvironment (especially CAFs), we suppose that the genes about membrane protein and secreted factors will be likely to associate with chemotherapy resistance. Then we have looked through the relevant literatures, to evaluate the research status and prospect of these genes, and eventually chosen CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 as candidate genes. The differential expression of these genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed by RT-RCR (p<0.05), suggesting potential predictors of response to treatment.CXCL2 is one member of a family of structurally related chemokines, which are also called ELR-positive subgroup of CXC-chemokines. It was reported that CXCL2 could enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro and differential expression of CXCL2 in colon cancer had impact on metastatic disease and survival. In addition, CXCL2 was found to show significantly different expression in 5-FU responder and nonresponder breast cancer cell lines, suggesting its relationship with chemotherapy response. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 has been focused on, in view of the association between its five polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Moreover, the study carried out by Li et al. established the relationship between TP and MMPs in cancer cell invasion. Recently, the up-regulation expression of MMP1 was observed during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude mice, indicating potential targets involved in the control of metastasis. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which was indicated to correlate with the growth and progression of tumors. Some interesting observations were made with regard to the prognostic role of baseline plasma IL8 protein levels in breast cancer patients treated with weekly docetaxel. Besides, Snoussi et al. pointed out that the polymorphisms in IL-8 and its receptor CXCR2 are associated with increased breast cancer risk and disease progress, implying that IL-8 and CXCR2 might contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis and aggressiveness. Lee et al. found that increased expression of IL-8 in the tumor microenvironment enhanced colon cancer growth and metastasis, which is very inspiring for our research. All the above markers including CXCL2, MMP1 and IL-8 were up-regulated based on our study, while FGF1, RARRES1 and CXCR7 as follows were down-regulated.As is known, breast cancer cells overexpress fibroblast growth factor receptors. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) was reported to be especially suitable as chemotherapeutic drug carrier in light of its biological activity. Additionally, FGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR could efficiently decrease breast cancer cell viability, suggesting the possibility for targeted therapy. According to these data, it could be assumed that decreased expression of FGF1 might be involved in the chemotherapy resistance. Retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1) is a retinoid regulated gene, which is accounted as a tumor suppress gene and lost in many cancer cells. It has been demonstrated that the down-regulation of RARRES1 is related to tumor growth of colorectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The investigation on the role of RARRES1 in the chemotherapy resistance is still rare, therefore its decreased expression in CAFs after chemotherapy caused our attention. CXCR7, as well as CXCR4, have been known as the receptors of chemokine CXCL12. Liberman et al. considered that CXCR7 would elicit anti-tumorigenic functions, and may act as a regulator of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling in neuroblastoma. Recently Hernandez et al. found that CXCR7 impaired invasion of breast cancer, in contrast to CXCR4. We propose that CXCR7 would contribute to the chemotherapy resistance in the condition of treatment-induced damage to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, in the abovementioned candidate genes, CXCL2, MMP1 and IL8 are recognized as secretory-type genes, which possibly could be tested in serum in the form of genes or proteins. Its relationship with prognosis will be studied.Overall, in this study we have primarily cultured CAFs, compared its gene expression profiling before and after chemotherapy, and picked up 6 candidate genes which are possibly associated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. We hope that our study might supply the potential predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and possible targets for treatment, which could provide the patient with optimal therapeutic management and better prognosis. For further study, the molecular mechanism of these candidate markers will continue to be researched to elucidate their relationship with chemotherapy resistance.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer statistics, 2012Effects of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy for early breast cancer on recurrence and 15-year survival: an overview of the randomised trialsImplication of tumor microenvironment in the resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patientsStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionRoots and stems: stem cells in cancerA stroma-related gene signature predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancerRole of extracellular matrix assembly in interstitial transport in solid tumorsTargeting tumor-associated fibroblasts improves cancer chemotherapy by increasing intratumoral drug uptakeTumor microenvironment and breast cancer progression: A complex scenarioFibroblasts in cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor growth-bystanders turning into key playersA fibroblast-associated antigen: characterization in fibroblasts and immunoreactivity in smooth muscle differentiated stromal cellsEpithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer can provide a nonmalignant stromaBone marrow contribution to tumor-associated myofibroblasts and fibroblastsAdipose tissue-derived stem cells differentiate into carcinoma-associated fibroblast-like cells under the influence of tumor-derived factorsp53 Attenuates cancer cell migration and invasion through repression of SDF-1/CXCL12 expression in stromal fibroblastsExpression of p21waf1/Cip1 in stromal fibroblasts of primary breast tumorsPten in stromal fibroblasts suppresses mammary epithelial tumoursCaveolin-1 and mitochondrial SOD2 (MnSOD) function as tumor suppressors in the stromal microenvironment: a new genetically tractable model for human cancer associated fibroblastsRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisImpact, mechanisms, and novel chemotherapy strategies for overcoming resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes in metastatic breast cancerAdvances in neoadjuvant (primary) systemic therapy with cytotoxic agentsResearch issues affecting preoperative systemic therapy for operable breast cancer17p12 deletion in breast cancer predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapyBRCA1 protein levels and PIK3CA mutations as predictive biomarkers for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: An exploratory analysisHighly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from lung and breastThe role of CXC chemokines and their receptors in cancerDifferential expression of the chemokines GRO-2, GRO-3, and interleukin-8 in colon cancer and their impact on metastatic disease and survivalCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCurrent evidence on the relationship between five polymorphisms in the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) gene and lung cancer risk: A meta-analysisIncreased Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases Mediates Thromboxane A2-Induced Invasion in Lung Cancer CellsProtein expression changes during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude miceIncreased expression of MMP-9 and IL-8 are correlated with poor prognosis of Bladder CancerInterleukin-8 secretion by ovarian cancer cells increases anchorage-independent growth, proliferation, angiogenic potential, adhesion and invasionExpression of Angiogenic Markers in the Peripheral Blood of Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer Treated with Weekly DocetaxelCombined effects of IL-8 and CXCR2 gene polymorphisms on breast cancer susceptibility and aggressivenessInterleukin-8 and its receptor CXCR2 in the tumour microenvironment promote colon cancer growth, progression and metastasisFGF-1 as a possible carrier for targeted drug deliveryFGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR efficiently decrease cell viability upon NIR irradiationTazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) expression in prostate carcinomas and its relationship to tumorigenicityRole of the RARRES1 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinomaRARRES1 expression is significantly related to tumour differentiation and staging in colorectal adenocarcinomaInvolvement of the CXCR7/CXCR4/CXCL12 Axis in the Malignant Progression of Human NeuroblastomaOpposing roles of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in breast cancer metastasis"

Although these functions could support a tumor suppressor function for geminin, ablation in mouse embryos or human cells didn\u2032t induce endoreplication or tumorigenesis without stimulus. To date, there have never been any reports describing any genetic or epigenetic alterations in the geminin gene in human breast cancer. Our sequencing efforts of the whole gene in ~150 breast tumors confirmed this lack of alterations in geminin gene.In contrast, geminin is overexpressed in many cancers, including breast cancers, suggesting an oncogenic function instead for\u00a0geminin. Mechanisms to explain this oncogenic role range from ability to maintain pluripotency in early cell lineages, promotion of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic stem cells, and geminin ability to control proper cytokinesis in G2/M/early G1-phases in normal human mammary epithelial (HME) cells, while cytokinesis failure and production of aneuploid, aggressive breast cancer cells when overexpressed.In normal cells, during G2/M/early G1, geminin helps Aurora B chromosome condensation function, and TopoII\u03b1 chromosome decatenation function. In breast cancer cells, geminin overexpression blocks Aurora B histone H3-(serine 10) phosphorylation, leading to failure in chromosome condensation, aborted cytokinesis, and aneuploidy. In geminin-overexpressing breast cancer cells, TopoII\u03b1 is prematurely de-sumoylated and released from chromosomal decatenation sites, also leading to aneuploidy due to elevated chromosomal breakage.Our recent work showed that, while during S-phase, geminin is a nuclear soluble-serine/threonine (S/T) phosphorylated protein, during G2/M/early G1-phases, it becomes chromatin bound-tyrosine (Y) phosphorylated protein. While overexpression of wild-type geminin triggers aneuploidy, a single Y-to-A mutant geminin (contains 3 Y-residues at position: 98, 111, and 150) triggers apoptosis, suggesting geminin oncogenic function requires simultaneous phosphorylation on all 3Ys, implicating the upstream kinases in this function. Our intense search for these kinases revealed the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Abl phosphorylates geminin-Y150 in vitro, and in vivo. Indeed, imatinib and nilotinib (two c-Abl inhibitors) promote geminin-overexpressing cell death, in vitro, and geminin-overexpressing tumor regression, in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of several large human breast tumor cohorts revealed geminin overexpression in ~50% of the tumors, while c-Abl overexpression in >90% of the tumors. These analyses also revealed geminin-negative tumors (i.e., expressing normal tissue level), overexpress cytoplasmic c-Abl, while geminin-overexpressing tumors (especially TNBCs) overexpress nuclear c-Abl. We now refer to geminin/nuclear c-Abl co-overexpressing tumors as \u201cGemOE\u201d tumors.High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a ubiquitous DNA-binding protein with essential DNA metabolism functions. HMGB1 can be released passively from necrotic cells or actively from activated immune cells, hypoxic, or inflamed cancer cells. HMGB1 secretion requires hyper-acetylation on the chromatin. Recently, we described how geminin helps acetylate chromatic HMGB1 and release it from\u00a0GemOE tumor cells, where it through binding to receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on GemOE tumor cells activates NF-\u03baB-induced survival, especially those exposed to the harsh condition of hypoxia and inflammation within the tumor core (aka \u201caggressiveness niche\u201d). Binding of extracellular Ac-HMGB1 to RAGE on na\u00efve mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) activates NF-\u03baB signaling-induced CXCR4 expression. CXCR4-expressing MSCs are then recruited to CXCL12/SDF1-secreting GemOE cells, in vitro, and into the aggressiveness niche, in vivo.We expand these data, here, and show MSCs activated by Ac-HMGB1 secrete the calcium-binding protein, S100A4 (aka metastasin), a known promoter of breast cancer proliferation, invasion, and\u00a0metastasis. In, TNBCs, expression of a nuclear/cytoplasmic S100A4 is associated with high histological tumor grade and inferior metastasis-free and overall survival. We show S100A4 entrains GemOE cells to recruit macrophages into the aggressiveness niche and polarizes them to Gas6-secreting M2-TAMs. GemOE tumor cells overexpress the tyrosine kinase receptor, AXL, that binds Gas6. AXL is overexpressed in breast cancers (especially ER\u03b1-negative tumors). Activation of AXL and RAGE in GemOE tumor cells converts them into metastatic precursors capable of dissemination from primary tumors through exacerbating the stemness and EMT phenotypes in them, and the expression and functional interaction of the intravasation-inducing CD151 and \u03b13\u03b21-integrin.ResultsGemOE cells recruit and activate MSCs into S100A4-secreting CAFsGemOE cells recruit and activate MSCs.

(G) Schematic representation showing the data discussed in the Figure.Extracellular Ac-HMGB1 activation of RAGE on na\u00efve MSCs triggers CXCR4 expression and recruitment towards CXCL12-secreting GemOE cells. To expand these data, normal HME, or two of the 1\u00b0 orthotopic GemOE mammary tumors; Gem240, and Gem257 cells were grown (24\u2009h) under normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) in Dox-containing media in the presence or absence of imatinib. ELISA revealed that compared to CM from cells expressing low-level geminin, induced Gem240 and Gem257 cells CM contained ~3-fold higher HMGB1 (Fig.\u00a01A, white, and compare white to blue, Suppl. Fig.\u00a01). Hypoxia did not affect normal HME or Dox-uninduced cells (Fig.\u00a01, red, and compare blue and black, Suppl. Fig.\u00a01), while exacerbated HMGB1 secretion from Dox-induced cells (Fig.\u00a01A, red, and Suppl. Fig.\u00a01). Imatinib blocked hypoxia-induced effects (compare black to red, Fig.\u00a01A). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a02).Na\u00efve MSCs (see [\u2212], Fig.\u00a01B) are RAGE-negative, remain negative after exposure to HME cells CM (Fig.\u00a01B). In contrast, exposure (24\u2009h) to Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells CM induced RAGE expression on MSCs surface (blot for membrane proteins, Fig.\u00a01B). In contrast, whether na\u00efve or exposed to CM from any of these cell lines, MSCs express equally high levels of TLR4 (a second HMGB1 receptor) on their surface (Fig.\u00a01B).RNAs were isolated from na\u00efve MSCs exposed (24\u2009h) to Ac-rHMGB1 (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml), or CM from Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells in the presence of vehicles (IgG isotype\u2009+\u2009DMSO), HMGB1 neutralizing antibody (NeuAb, 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml), imatinib, TLR4 TAK-242, glycyrrhizin, Bay 11-7082, or MK-2206. RT/qPCR showed RAGE mRNA increases ~30fold in na\u00efve MSCs exposed to Ac-rHMGB1, or CM from Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells (compare [\u2212] to vehicles, white, Fig.\u00a01C). All drugs except glycyrrhizin and MK-2206 blocked this increase (white bars, Fig.\u00a01C). Moreover, previously, we showed that CXCR4 expression increases in na\u00efve MSCs by Ac-HMGB1 downstream of RAGE. CXCR4 mRNA level was also increased by ~30fold in na\u00efve MSCs exposed to Ac-rHMGB1 or CM from Dox-induced Gem240 cells or Gem257 cells (compare [\u2212] to vehicle, black bars, Fig.\u00a01C). All drugs except MK-2206 blocked this increase in CXCR4 mRNA expression (black bars, Fig.\u00a01C). Together reinforce our previous published data and expand them to show Ac-HMGB1 activates TLR4 first to trigger RAGE expression, which then also through activation by Ac-HMGB1 triggers CXCR4 expression. Noteworthy, Ac-HMGB1 in both situations activated NF-\u03baB rather than AKT signaling in MSCs.Na\u00efve MSCs layered in inserts of Boyden chambers efficiently migrated towards Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells CM not MSCs CM or HME cells CM added in the lower chamber within 24\u2009h (Fig.\u00a01D). The recruitment was almost completely blocked in the presence of HMGB1 or CXCL12 NeuAbs (Fig.\u00a01D). Together, reinforce that a primary function for RAGE/CXCR4 activation in na\u00efve MSCs is to promote their\u00a0 migration\u00a0towards GemOE tumor cells (step 1, Fig.\u00a01G).Unlike na\u00efve MSCs (Fig.\u00a01B), HME and Dox-induced GemOE cells express no TLR4 while expressing equally high-levels of RAGE on their surface (Fig.\u00a01E, upper). Hypoxia did not alter this pattern (Fig.\u00a01E, lower). RAGE also binds the S100 family members. Since RAGE is constitutively expressed on GemOE cells, we evaluated whether activated MSCs express/release HMGB1 or S100 proteins.RNAs were isolated from na\u00efve MSCs exposed (24\u2009h) to na\u00efve MSCs CM, normal HME cells CM, Dox-induced Gem240, or Gem257 cells CM. RT/qPCR showed that only exposure to Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells CM induced expression of S100A2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, not S100A1, 7, or HMGB1 mRNAs in na\u00efve MSCs (Suppl. Fig.\u00a03A). Because of\u00a0S100A4 role in breast cancer metastasis, we pursued it further. We found that HMGB1 NeuAb blocked the elevation of S100A4 mRNAs expression in MSCs following exposure to Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells CM (Suppl. Fig.\u00a03B).Moreover, ELISA showed that neither normal HME cells nor Dox-induced GemOE cells secrete S100A4 (not shown). In contrast, na\u00efve MSCs exposed (24\u2009h) to Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells CM only secrete high-levels of S100A4 (Fig.\u00a01F, white bars). This secretion increased further when hypoxic Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells CM was used instead (Fig.\u00a01F, red) and almost completely blocked by HMGB1 NeuAb (Fig.\u00a01F, black). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a04). Together suggest that in the vicinity of GemOE cells, MSCs differentiate into S100A4-secreting cancer-associated fibroblasts (i.e., CAFs, Fig.\u00a01G, step 2).S100A4-activated GemOE cells attract and polarize macrophages into Gas6-secreting M2-TAMsRecently, we showed that IRISOE cells secrete high-levels of CCL2, in vitro, and in vivo to recruit macrophages. To define whether bidirectional interaction between GemOE cells and MSCs through S100A4 exists was studied next.MSCs-reactivated GemOE cells recruit and activate macrophages.

(B) The level of CCL2 secreted from the indicated cell lines under normoxic or hypoxic condition co-cultures with MSCs in the absence or presence of S100A4 NeuAb or glycyrrhizin.

(C) Real-time RT/PCR analysis of the CCR2 mRNA in THP1-macrophages exposed 24\u2009h to the co-cultures of the indicated cell lines with MSCs supplemented with CCL2 NeuAb or BMS CCR2 22.

The blot was repeated 3 separate times. (E) The effect of the CM from the indicated co-cultures with MSCs for 24 on the migration of THP1-macrophages performed for 24\u2009h in Boyden chambers in the presence of vehicle or CCL2 NeuAb. Assay performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (F) The levels of AXL in the indicated cells. The blot was repeated 3 separate times. (G) The level of Gas6 secreted from THP1-macrophages exposed 24\u2009h to the indicated co-cultures generated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions in the absence or presence of CCL2 NeuAb or BMS CC2 22. Assay performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (H) Schematic representation showing the data discussed in the Figure.CM from normal HME cells or Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (24\u2009h) re-conditioned by exposure to MSCs (another 24\u2009h, Fig.\u00a02A1) were re-added to the same cell line in the absence or presence of S100A4 NeuAb or glycyrrhizin (24\u2009h, Fig.\u00a02A2). ELISA showed MSCs (Fig.\u00a02B, blue), and normal HME cells exposed to their normoxic or hypoxic CM re-conditioned by MSCs (Fig.\u00a02B, orange and red, respectively) or not (Fig.\u00a02B, white) did not secrete CCL2. In contrast, Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells secreted low-levels of CCL2 when exposed to their CM (Fig.\u00a02B, white), slightly increased following exposure to their normoxic CM re-conditioned by MSCs (Fig.\u00a02B, orange), and increased even further when exposed to their hypoxic CM reconditioned by MSCs (Fig.\u00a02B, red). Importantly, S100A4 NeuAb (Fig.\u00a02B, green) and glycyrrhizin (Fig.\u00a02B, black) both blocked these increases. One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a05).The receptor for CCL2, CCR2, controls the trafficking of monocytes into damaged tissues or tumors. Recently, we showed CCL2 upregulates CCR2 expression on unpolarized macrophages. PMA-treated THP1-macrophages (hereafter THP1s) were exposed (24\u2009h) to HME cells/or Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-cultures CM (Fig.\u00a02A3). Real-time RT/qPCR and western blot analysis of these THP1s showed low-levels CCR2 mRNA in unexposed THP1s ([\u2212], Fig.\u00a02C). While MSCs only CM did not induce CCR2 mRNA and protein expression, a slight increase was detected in THP1s exposed to hypoxic HME cells/MSCs co-culture CM (Fig.\u00a02C,D). In contrast, high-levels CCR2 mRNA was detected in THP1s exposed to hypoxic Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-culture CM (Fig.\u00a02C). This induction was significantly blocked by CCL2 NeuAb and BMS CCR2 22 (Fig.\u00a02C). Importantly, high-levels CCR2 protein expression was detected in THP1s exposed to Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-culture CM only (Fig.\u00a02D). Taken together, confirming the role of\u00a0CCL2 in CCR2 expression in THP1s and primary macrophages.Many THP1s layered in inserts of Boyden chambers migrated 24\u2009h later towards Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-cultures CM only in the lower chambers. Importantly, in the presence of CCL2 NeuAb, this migration was significantly blocked (Fig.\u00a02E), supporting the CCL2/CCR2 role in macrophages recruitment into GemOE tumors.Our analysis of receptors upregulated on the surface of the 1\u00b0 orthotopic GemOE mammary tumors revealed many important metastasis inducing receptors. One such receptor, AXL, was chosen for further analysis in this study due to its pronounced role in intravasation and breast cancer metastasis. Compared to normal HME cells, Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, and Gem257 cells express significantly higher levels of AXL on their surfaces (western done on cell membrane extracts, Fig.\u00a02F).The ligand for AXL; Gas6 also has a notable role in breast cancer progression. Interestingly, compared to normal HME cells CM, Dox-induced Gem240, or Gem257 cells alone CM induced low-levels Gas6 secretion from THP1s (see Fig.\u00a02A4,G, white). This secretion was significantly increased when THP1s were instead exposed to normoxic Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-culture CM (Fig.\u00a02G, orange). Even higher secretion was detected when hypoxic Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-culture CM (Fig.\u00a02G, red). Importantly, CCL2 NeuAb and BMS CCR2 22 significantly blocked Gas6 secretion from THP1s exposed to the hypoxic co-cultures CM (Fig.\u00a02G, green and black, respectively). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a06). Together suggest S100A4 re-activate GemOE cells to secrete CCL2 that\u00a0attracts macrophages and polarizes them into Gas6-secreting M2-tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs, Fig.\u00a02H).Imatinib-sensitive MSCs and TAMs recruitment in vivoPreviously, we injected shCtrl-, sh-geminin- or shc-Abl-expressing GemOE cells into athymic female mice mammary fat pads. Geminin- or c-Abl-depleted cells developed <20% size tumors, compared to control cells, supporting the intimate relationship between c-Abl and geminin and giving credence to using imatinib to treat GemOE mammary tumors (especially TNBC) see introduction and.GemOE tumor cells recruit and interact with MSCs and TAMs, in vivo. (A) Schematic representation of the in vivo assay discussed in the Figure. Representative images of GFP-MSCs (B1) or GFP-THP1-macrophages (B2) found in GemOE tumors treated in vivo with vehicle (lefts) or imatinib (rights) according to the protocol in (A). The tumors were dissociated into single cells and cultured overnight before photographing. The numbers of GFP-MSCs (C1) or GFP-THP1-macrophages (C2) found in GemOE tumors treated in vivo with vehicle (blacks) or imatinib (red and organ) according to the protocol in (A). The tumors were dissociated into single cells and cultured overnight before counting. The levels of HMGB1 (D), CXCL12 (E), and S100A4 (F) in sera isolated from PBs of na\u00efve mice (before tumor cells injection), tumor-bearing mice before or after vehicle or imatinib treatments. (G) Kaplan Meir curve of the recurrence-free survival in indicated numbers of patients overexpressing geminin\u2009+\u2009HMGB1\u2009+\u2009S100A4 vs. low expressing patients.We injected 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 Gem240 or Gem257 cells in athymic female mice (n\u2009=\u200924/cell line, Fig.\u00a03A), and kept the mice on Dox-supplemented drinking water. Mice developed ~0.5\u2009cm3 tumors within 4weeks, at which time (i.e., day\u00a0-1), mice were randomized into two groups: one received vehicle (DMSO, n\u2009=\u200912/cell line), and the other 10\u2009mg/kg of imatinib (orally, n\u2009=\u200912/cell line, Fig.\u00a03A). We activated GFP-human MSCs (GFP-hMSCs) by culturing for a week in CM from Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells (changed daily), and GFP-THP1s by culturing in Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-cultures CM (also changed daily). On day (0), 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 of activated GFP-hMSCs or GFP-THP1s were intracardiac (i.c., through the left ventricle) injected in vehicle (n\u2009=\u20096/cell line) or imatinib (n\u2009=\u20096/cell line) treated mice and treatments were administrated at that time and daily thereafter on days 1, 2, and 3 (Fig.\u00a03A). Tumors and peripheral blood (PB) were collected from all mice on day 4 (Fig.\u00a03A).Part of each tumor was dissociated into single cells and grew in culture overnight. Next day GFP+-cells were counted in at least five high magnification fields (HF) from at least three tumors treated with vehicle or imatinib, and data for both cell lines were pooled (similar results). We detected 10.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 GFP-hMSCs/HF in cultures from vehicle-treated tumors (Fig.\u00a03B1, left, and 3C1, black) vs. 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 in cultures from imatinib-treated tumors (Fig.\u00a03B1, right and 3C1, red, p\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126). Similarly, there was 11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 GFP-THP1s/HF in cultures from vehicle-treated tumors (Fig.\u00a03B2, left and 3C2, black) vs. 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 in cultures from imatinib-treated tumors (Fig.\u00a03B2, right, and 3C2, orange, p\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126).ELISA performed on sera isolated from the PBs showed (here too, data for similar treated\u00a0mice were pooled, similar results) that consistent with others and our previous data, HMGB1 level was 14.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4\u2009ng/ml in sera from na\u00efve mice (n\u2009=\u200948, Fig.\u00a03D, yellow), increased to 154.0\u2009\u00b1\u200936.3\u2009ng/ml in sera from tumor-bearing mice (n\u2009=\u200948, collected on day (\u22121), p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03D, blue), remained high at 155.2\u2009\u00b1\u200942.9\u2009ng/ml in sera from vehicle-treated mice (n\u2009=\u200924, collected at euthanasia, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03D, red), dropped to 24.8\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5\u2009ng/ml in sera from imatinib-treated mice (n\u2009=\u200924, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03D, brown). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a07).Similarly, CXCL12 level was 1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20099.7\u2009ng/ml in sera from na\u00efve mice (Fig.\u00a03E, yellow), increased to 18.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009ng/ml in tumor-bearing mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03E, blue), remained high at 17.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3\u2009ng/ml in vehicle-treated mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03E, red), dropped to 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009ng/ml in imatinib-treated mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03E, brown). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a08).Finally, S100A4 level was 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009ng/ml in sera from na\u00efve mice (Fig.\u00a03F, yellow), increased to 15.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7\u2009ng/ml in tumor-bearing mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03F, blue), remained high at 16.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1\u2009ng/ml in vehicle-treated mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03F, red), dropped to 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7\u2009ng/ml in imatinib-treated mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03F, brown). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a09). Interestingly, analysis of TCGA data confirmed that compared to low geminin\u2009+\u2009HMGB1\u2009+\u2009S100A4-expressing patients, patients expressing high levels had an inferior recurrence-free survival (RFS, p\u2009=\u20090.007, compare red to black, Fig.\u00a03G).Further evidence for the recruitment of MSCs and TAMs into GemOE tumorsBi-directional interaction of GemOE cells\u00a0 with\u00a0stromal cells in GemOE tumors. (A) Schematic representation of the in vivo assay discussed in the Figure. (B) Gem240 tumor volume (Gem257 cells produced identical data) following the protocol described in (A) in the presence of the indicated inhibitors. The red arrow indicates the start of treatments. Student t-test was used to compare vehicle-treated tumors and each treatment separately. Fluorescence IHC staining of sections from the tumors above using mouse-specific anti-CD105 (MSCs specific biomarker) and anti-TLR4 (C), or mouse-specific anti-CD163 (macrophage-specific biomarker) and anti-CCR2 (D). (E) The level of CCL2 (upper) and Gas6 (lower) in na\u00efve mice, tumor-bearing mice before or after vehicle, imatinib, FPS-ZM1, and TAK-242 treatments at tumor resection. (F) Schematic representation showing the data discussed so far.Again, based on our previous experience with imatinib, and because our model specifically calls for macrophages recruitment as a subsequent step for the MSCs recruitment (Fig.\u00a02H), we aimed at further analyze these interactions through inhibiting the two receptors; RAGE and TLR4 we propose mostly involved in MSCs recruitment. We injected 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 Gem240, or Gem257 cells in athymic female mice (n\u2009=\u200924/cell line, see Fig.\u00a04A) kept on Dox-supplemented drinking water. The mice developed ~0.5\u2009cm3 tumor volume within 4weeks, at which time they were randomized into 4 groups received vehicle (DMSO, n\u2009=\u20096), imatinib (10\u2009mg/kg, n\u2009=\u20096), FPS-ZM1 (10\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.], 1\u2009mg/kg, n\u2009=\u20096), or TAK-242 (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p. n\u2009=\u20096). Drugs were administered 3times/week for 4weeks (Fig.\u00a04A).Vehicle-treated Gem240 (identical results were obtained using Gem257) tumors grow ~200% by day 60 (Fig.\u00a04B, black), while imatinib (Fig.\u00a04B, red), FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a04B, green) or TAK-242 (Fig.\u00a04B, blue) treated tumors regressed by ~50% (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126 for all drugs, Fig.\u00a04B). All tumors were resected, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 4\u2009\u00b5m, and immune-stained. Vehicle-treated tumors only showed high-levels CD105 (mouse MSCs fibrogenic differentiation biomarker)/TLR4 co-stained cells (Fig.\u00a04C1\u20133), and CD163 (M2-macrophage-specific biomarker)/CCR2 co-stained cells (Fig.\u00a04D1\u20133). Imatinib (Fig.\u00a04C5\u20137,D5\u20137), FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a04C9\u201311,D9\u201311), or TAK-242 (Fig.\u00a04C13\u201315,D13\u201315) treated mice were negative for both cells.Finally, sera were isolated from PBs from these mice at euthanasia. ELISA (data from both cell lines were pooled) showed 0.052\u2009\u00b1\u20090.030\u2009ng/ml of CCL2 in na\u00efve mice sera (n\u2009=\u200948, Fig.\u00a04E, upper-black), increased to 2.358\u2009\u00b1\u20090.524\u2009ng/ml in tumor-bearing mice sera (n\u2009=\u200948, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, upper-red), remained high at 2.418\u2009\u00b1\u20090.512\u2009ng/ml in vehicle-treated mice sera (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, upper-green). The level dropped to 0.205\u2009\u00b1\u20090.119\u2009ng/ml in imatinib-treated mice sera (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, upper-orange), to 0.756\u2009\u00b1\u20090.269\u2009ng/ml in FPS-treated mice (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, upper-pink), and to 0.962\u2009\u00b1\u20090.182\u2009ng/ml in TAK-242-treated mice (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, upper-blue). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a010).Similarly, 1.865\u2009\u00b1\u20090.999\u2009ng/ml of Gas6 was detected in na\u00efve mice sera (n\u2009=\u200948, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-black), increased to 33.534\u2009\u00b1\u20096.738\u2009ng/ml in tumor-bearing mice sera (n\u2009=\u200948, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-red), remained high at 35.505\u2009\u00b1\u20094.378 in the vehicle-treated mice sera (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-green). The level dropped to 7.073\u2009\u00b1\u20091.857\u2009ng/ml in imatinib-treated mice sera (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-pink), to 9.842\u2009\u00b1\u20092.256\u2009ng/ml in FPS-treated mice sera (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-pink) and to 10.539\u2009\u00b1\u20092.772\u2009ng/ml in TAK-242-treated mice sera (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-blue). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a011). Together, suggest blocking HMGB1 secretion or function prevents recruitment of MSCs and TAMs into GemOE tumors and their conversion into pro-tumor S100A4-secreting CAFs and Gas6-secreting M2-TAMs (Fig.\u00a04F) leading to tumor regerssion.The bi-directional loops are involved in GemOE-induced TNBC metastasisThe bi-directional pathways elevate the GemOE tumor metastasis.

Fig.\u00a04F), we injected 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 Gem240 or Gem257 cells admixed with 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 hMSCs in female athymic mice (48mice/cell line, Fig.\u00a05A) kept on Dox-supplemented drinking water. The mice developed ~0.5\u2009cm3 tumor volume within 4weeks (Fig.\u00a05A), at which time they were randomized into 4 groups/cell line treated with vehicle (DMSO, n\u2009=\u200912), imatinib (n\u2009=\u200912, 10\u2009mg/kg, orally), FPS-ZM1 (n\u2009=\u200912, 1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), or R428 (n\u2009=\u200912, 150\u2009mg/kg, orally) daily for 2 weeks (Fig.\u00a05A). Half of the mice were maintained for tumor growth (Fig.\u00a05B). In the other half, tumors were resected in survival surgeries, and metastasis was followed using IVIS for a maximum of 4months (Fig.\u00a05A).Tumors in vehicle-treated mice increased ~50% within the treatment period (Fig.\u00a05B, black). In contrast, tumors in mice treated with imatinib (Fig.\u00a05B, red), FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a05B, green), or R428 (Fig.\u00a05B, blue) regressed by >50%.Only in vehicle-treated mice, we detected macro-metastases, especially to the lungs (n\u2009=\u200912, i.e., 6/cell line, Fig.\u00a05C, upper right). Noteworthy, one mouse also developed a lymph-node metastasis (Fig.\u00a05D, upper), and another developed widespread metastasis in almost all organs (Fig.\u00a05D, lower). In contrast, none of the mice injected with either cell line developed metastasis following imatinib (Fig.\u00a05C, lower left), FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a05C, lower middle), or R428 (Fig.\u00a05C, lower right) treatment, although few mice developed very small micro-metastases (arrowheads and insets in Fig.\u00a05C, lower). Detail analysis of these metastases will be reported elsewhere. Importantly, only in vehicle-treated mice, we detected AXL+/vimentin+ cells in the tumors (compare Fig.\u00a05E1\u20134 to E5\u20138,E9\u201312,E13\u201316).To support these data further, we carried out Kaplan Meier analysis using several publicly available breast cancer data sets. Geminin-overexpressing patients had inferior recurrence-free survival (RFS, n\u2009=\u20093955, HR\u2009=\u20091.6, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.43\u20131.78, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a05F) and distance metastasis-free survival (DMFS, n\u2009=\u20091747, HR\u2009=\u20091.23, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01\u20131.49, p\u2009=\u20090.039, Fig.\u00a05G). Geminin\u2009+\u2009RAGE\u2009+\u2009AXL-overexpressing patients had inferior overall survival (OS, n\u2009=\u2009594, HR\u2009=\u20092.27, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.28\u20134.03, p\u2009=\u20090.0005681, Fig.\u00a05H), and geminin\u2009+\u2009HMGB1\u2009+\u2009RAGE\u2009+\u2009CCL2\u2009+\u2009AXL-overexpressing patients had inferior lung metastasis-free survival (LMFS, n\u2009=\u200958, HR\u2009=\u20097.35, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.38\u201322.63, p\u2009=\u20090.0005123, Suppl. Fig.\u00a012). Together, confirm that positive feedback loops with MSCs/CAFs and/or M2-TAMs, especially within the aggressiveness niche through RAGE and AXL, respectively (cf. Fig.\u00a04F) worsen the outcomes for patients with GemOE/TNBC tumors.AXL and RAGE enhance GemOE cell invasion abilityHME, Gem197, Gem240, and Gem257 cells were switched to Dox-containing serum-free (SF)-media for 24\u2009h before they were treated in Dox-containing SF-media with none or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428, or both for 30\u2009mins or 24\u2009h.The roles of RAGE and AXL in promoting invasion in GemOE tumor cells.

(C) Representative images of the invasion of Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells through Matrigel-coated inserts of Boyden chambers 24\u2009h after incubation with SF-media supplemented with none, or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, plus FPS-ZM1, plus R428, or plus FPS-ZM1\u2009+\u2009R428. (D) Quantitative analysis of the data presented in (C). Assay performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (E) The expression of geminin and AXL in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h growth in Dox-containing SF-media followed by switching to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none or S100A4 with or without FPS-ZM1. (F) The expression of geminin and AXL in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h growth in Dox-containing SF- media followed by switching to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none or Gas6 with or without R428. (G) The expression of MMP2 and MMP9 (pro and active forms) in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h growth in Dox-containing SF-media followed by switching to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none, or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas plus vehicle, plus FPS-ZM1, plus R428, or plus FPS-ZM1\u2009+\u2009R428 for 24\u2009h. (H) Schematic representation showing the data discussed in the Figure.Following 30\u2009min treatments, the membrane/cytoplasmic fractions were isolated. HME cells express no/low-levels of the total (T-)AXL (see below), p-AXLY779, T-AKT, p-AKTT308/S473, T-ERK, p-ERKT183/Y185, NF-\u03baB and survivin under all conditions (Fig.\u00a06A). In contrast, in SF-media, Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells express >5-fold higher T-AXL (see below), T-AKT, NF-\u03baB, and survivin, and similar levels of T-ERK compared to HME cells (Fig.\u00a06A). Treatment with FPS-ZM1, R428, or both did not significantly affect the expression of total proteins (Fig.\u00a06A). Although the levels of p-AXLY779, p-AKTT308/S473, and p-ERKT183/Y185 were not significantly affected by S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle treatment, FPS-ZM1, R428 and even more so in both treatments significantly decreased the levels of these proteins (Fig.\u00a06A), suggesting cross-talk between AXL and RAGE that activates AXL, AKT, and to some extent, ERK signaling in GemOE cells (cf. Fig.\u00a06H).Following the 24\u2009h treatments, cells were sonicated, and whole-cell extracts prepared. HME cells grown in SF-medium expressed low levels of geminin, CDH2, and survivin, while detectable levels of Twist1, Slug, Oct4, and Sox2 (Fig.\u00a06B). In contrast, in SF-media, all Dox-induced GemOE cells expressed high levels of geminin, CDH2, and survivin, and even higher levels of Twist1, Slug, Oct4, and Sox2 compared to HME cells (Fig.\u00a06B). None of the treatments significantly affected the expression of these proteins in HME cells (Fig.\u00a06B), while in SF-media, S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle elevated the expression of all proteins to different degrees in the three Dox-induced GemOE cell lines (Fig.\u00a06B). In SF-media, S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus FPS-ZM1 significantly decreased the expression of the majority of the proteins except for geminin to different degrees in the three Dox-induced GemOE cell lines (Fig.\u00a06B), plus R428 treatment decreased expression of all proteins in some instances marginally, e.g., Twist and Sox2, yet in others significantly, e.g., Slug and Oct4 (Fig.\u00a06B). In SF-media, S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus both drugs treatment, decreased the expression of all proteins even geminin to a level similar to that observed with R428 alone (Fig.\u00a06B), suggesting that RAGE perhaps primes AXL effects.Next, we layered Gem240 or Gem257 cells in Matrigel-coated inserts of Boyden chambers. In the lower well, we added SF-media containing Dox and none or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428, or both. After 24\u2009h, we counted cells invaded the Matrigel and migrated to the other side of the inserts as an in vitro confirmation of their stemness and EMT phenotype described above.Although, many Dox-induced Gem240 and Gem257 cells invaded in SF-condition (Fig.\u00a06C,D), a significant increase in the number of invaded cells was detected in the presence of S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle (Fig.\u00a06C,D). On the other hand, in the presence of FPS-ZM1 or R428, S100A\u2009+\u2009Gas6 effect on invasion was significantly blocked (Fig.\u00a06C,D). Again, the reduction in invasion was the same in the presence of both drugs or R428 alone (Fig.\u00a06C,D). One-way ANOVA test followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests confirmed these data (Suppl. Figs.\u00a013 and 14). Together, reinforces that RAGE activation perhaps primes GemOE/TNBC cells to Gas6 effects by affecting geminin and/or AXL expression and/or activity.To test this hypothesis, we grow HME, Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 in Dox-containing SF-media for 24\u2009h then switched them to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with S100A4 plus vehicle or FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a06E) or supplemented with Gas6 plus vehicle or R428 (Fig.\u00a06F). First, in SF-media, S100A4 elevated geminin and AXL levels in all Dox-induced GemOE (not HME) cells (compare green to red in Fig.\u00a06E). Importantly, the expression of geminin and AXL proteins were significantly decreased in the presence of S100A4 plus FPS-ZM1 (compare blue to green in Fig.\u00a06E). It is possible that S100A4/RAGE signaling stabilizes geminin protein (exogenous geminin is expressed from a heterologous promoter) and/or induces its\u00a0transcription. Geminin, then could affect AXL gene transcription and/or protein stabilization.Second, in SF-media, Gas6 did not affect geminin expression, while increased AXL expression in all Dox-induced GemOE cells (compare green to red in Fig.\u00a06F). R428 did not affect geminin expression in Dox-induced GemOE cells but inhibited AXL expression (compare blue to green in Fig.\u00a06F). It is possible that S100A4/RAGE signaling separately affects geminin or AXL. Alternatively, positive feedback between geminin and AXL is also possible. We favor the latter since only in Dox-induced GemOE cells, AXL was expressed (Fig.\u00a06E,F).Finally, in SF-media, Dox-induced Gem240 and Gem257 cells express relatively high levels of pro-/active-MMP2 and -MMP9. Expression of both significantly increased in the presence of S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle (Fig.\u00a06G) and was blocked in the presence of FPS-ZM1, R428, or both drugs (Fig.\u00a06G). The bidirectional interactions with MSCs/CAFs and M2-TAMs through S100A4/RAGE and Gas6/AXL signaling that activated AKT, ERK, and NF-\u03baB in GemOE cells elevate geminin and/or AXL expression triggering TNBC cells stemness, EMT, and their invasion ability (cf. Fig.\u00a06H).AXL and RAGE enhance GemOE cells\u2019 intravasation abilityThe integrin \u03b13 and \u03b21 (hereafter \u03b13\u03b21-integrin) complex with CD151 (expressed specifically on intravasating tumor cells) is essential to initiate and maintains a tight interaction with the extracellular matrices (ECMs); e.g., laminin I (LMN I), collagen IV (COL IV) and fibronectin (FN) on the basal side of endothelial cells of the vessel. To study this in our system, we grew Gem240 or Gem257 for 24\u2009h on uncoated wells or wells that were coated with LMN I, COL IV, or FN in SF-media containing Dox and supplemented with none or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428 or both. The next day, wells were washed 3 times, and the cells remaining attached to each well were counted in HF and blotted.The roles of RAGE and AXL in promoting intravasation in GemOE tumor cells. (A) The number of Gem240 cells (Gem257 cells showed identical results) attached to non-coated or LMN I-, COL IV-, or FN-coated wells 24\u2009h after platting followed by washing and counting of attached cells in at least 4 HPFs. Each assay was performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (B) The expression of the indicated proteins in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h growth in Dox-containing SF-media followed by a switch to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none, or Gas6 plus vehicle, or plus R428 for 24\u2009h. Note, the actin blot is the same as in Fig.\u00a06F because it is from the same experiment. Percentage of AXL+/\u03b21-integrin+ populations (red), the AXL+/CD151+ populations (white), or \u03b21-integrin+/CD151+ populations (black) derived from FACS analysis of non-permeabilized Dox-induced Gem197 (C), Gem240 (D), and Gem257 (E) treated as indicated. Each assay was performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (F) Schematic representation of the data in the entire study as well as future directions.The Gem240 cells (identical results were obtained with Gem257 cells, not shown) showed a high binding ability to uncoated wells under all conditions (white, Fig.\u00a07A). In comparison, binding to LMN I, COL IV, and FN was significantly decreased under SF conditions (none, Fig.\u00a07A). The binding to all matrices was restored in SF containing S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle (Fig.\u00a07A), which was blocked by FPS-ZM1, R428, or both treatments (Fig.\u00a07A). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a015). Together, suggest that AXL and/or RAGE positively affect the binding of intravasating tumor cells with the ECM on the vessels within GemOE tumors.To study the contribution of CD151 and \u03b13\u03b21 in this binding, we again in SF-media grow normal HME cells, or Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells in the presence of none, or Gas6 plus vehicle or plus R428. HME expressed very low levels of \u03b13-integrin, \u03b21-integrin, while a high level of \u03b24-integrin (\u03b24) and no CD151 (Fig.\u00a07B). In contrast, in SF-media, all Dox-induced GemOE cell lines expressed high levels of \u03b13-integrin and \u03b21-integrin, low levels of \u03b24-integrin, and very high levels of CD151 (red in Fig.\u00a07B). Gas6 treatment did not affect the expression of these proteins in normal HME cells, but significantly increased expression of \u03b13-integrin, \u03b21-integrin and CD151 in all Dox-induced GemOE cells by >2fold (compare green to red in Fig.\u00a07B). Importantly, inactivating AXL significantly blocked Gas6-induced expression of all four proteins in all Dox-induced GemOE cell lines (compare blue to green in Fig.\u00a07B), suggesting a direct role for AXL in GemOE intravasation ability.To establish this further, Gem197, Gem240, and Gem257 cells (HME cells were omitted from this analysis since they did not express CD151) grown in Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none or A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428 or both (24\u2009h). Non-permeabilized cells were first stained with FITC-anti-CD44, PE-anti-CD24. The stem-like (i.e., CD44+/CD24\u2212) population within each cell line was FACS sorted out and stained with PE-Cy7-anti-AXL, 561 620_20-anti-\u03b21-integrin, and APC-anti-CD151 for FACS analysis.AXL+/\u03b21+ cell populationsAll cell lines contained ~40% of AXL+/\u03b21+ cell populations in SF-media (red, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E), that\u00a0didn\u2019t change in the presence of S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle in any of the cell lines (red, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Although, S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus FPS-ZM1 or plus R428 didn\u2019t change this population in any of the cell lines, in S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus both a slightly yet significantly decreased in the AXL+/\u03b21+-populations in all cell lines was detected (red, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E).AXL+/CD151+ cell populationsAll cell lines contained >60% of AXL+/CD151+ cell populations in SF-media (white, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E), that\u00a0didn\u2019t change in S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, plus FPS-ZM1 or plus R428 treatments (white, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Importantly, a significant decrease in the percentage of the AXL+/CD151+ population was observed in all cell lines following S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus both drug treatment (Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E).\u03b21-integrin+/CD151+ cell populationsAll cell lines contained 25\u201340% of \u03b21+/CD151+ cell populations in SF-media (black, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Again, this percentage was not significantly changed in S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, plus FPS-ZM1 or plus R428 treatments (black, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Importantly, a significant decrease in the percentage of this \u03b21+/CD151+ cell populations was observed in all cell lines following treatment with S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus both drugs (black, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Taken together, we propose that GemOE triggers expression and/or activation of AXL and RAGE through interactions with the microenvironment that, in turn, enhances the expression and the functional interaction between \u03b13\u03b21-integrin and CD151. This complex by tightly binding to the ECM on the tumor side of endothelial cells enhances the intravasation ability of GemOE/TNBC metastatic precursors through the endothelium barrier upon dissemination (cf. Fig.\u00a07F).DiscussionThe vast majority of breast cancer deaths are due to metastatic diseases. Inflammation and hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment, especially the core (i.e., the aggressiveness niche) exacerbate metastasis. Here, we elucidated the mechanistic role of the bi-directional interactions between GemOE tumor cells and the microenvironment in promoting GemOE metastatic precursors invasion and intravasation abilities.MSCs and TAMs are recruited into tumors through tumor secreted factors. MSCs are recruited by Ac-HMGB1/CXCL12, while TAMs by CCL2. We resolved an issue that was unclear in our previous study, how Ac-HMGB1 induced CXCR4 expression through RAGE in the RAGE-negative na\u00efve MSCs? We found that Ac-HMGB1 activates TLR4 first, which then upregulates RAGE expression in na\u00efve MSCs (cf. Fig.\u00a01G). Earlier reports also showed that HMGB1 promotes CXCR4 expression through RAGE and TLR4.Interestingly, in our experiments, Ac-HMGB1 activated NF-\u03baB rather than AKT signaling via TLR4. A recent study showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling activates AKT via TLR4 to promote breast cancer metastasis. It is possible that during breast cancer metastasis, Ac-HMGB1 and LPS each initiate a specific signaling pathway downstream of TLR4.Another important aspect of our studies is that extracellular S100A4 instigates a tumor-supportive microenvironment in GemOE/TNBC tumors, as was recently shown. High S100A4 expression associates with poor outcome in early-stage cancers and direct interaction between S100A4 and RAGE was recently shown to promote motility in colorectal cancer cells via ERK-dependent mechanism, and prostate cancer cells via NF-\u03baB-activated pathway. Chronic inflammation enhances RAGE expression in many cancers, which was directly linked to low-rate patient survival. In our current analysis of a public dataset of >1700 breast cancer samples, low RFS in patients with high geminin\u2009+\u2009HMGB1\u2009+\u2009S100A4 (two RAGE ligands)-expressing patients was observed (Fig.\u00a03H). This observation supports the conclusion that RAGE signaling is involved in enhancing aggressiveness in GemOE TNBC tumors (cf. Fig.\u00a03G). We propose that Ac-HMGB1 plays a previously unappreciated role in early-stage TNBCs.TAMs presence within TNBC tumors is recognized as a critical factor in tumor progression and could be a prognostic factor of a worse outcome. Most human tumors exhibit TAMs with an M2-like phenotype involved in promoting EMT and contributing to tumor progression and drug resistance. In keeping, the presence of a high number of CD163+-M2 macrophages in GemOE orthotopic TNBC tumors was correlated with aggressive behavior. We propose that TAM secretome, including Gas6, contributes to this aggressiveness through activation of the AXL receptor, which is overexpressed on GemOE/TNBC tumor cells. Indeed, recently published reports demonstrate that mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells induce the release of Gas6 selectively from M2-type macrophages.It is possible that along with c-Abl, AXL is an additional therapeutic target to prevent GemOE metastatic precursors dissemination from TNBC primaries. It is possible that in vivo selective inhibition of AXL using R428 could cooperate with imatinib to impair GemOE/TNBC cell invasion and intravasation, entrapping these GemOE/TNBC metastatic precursors within primaries to be resected during surgery reducing the metastatic burden. In support of this conclusion, we found that high geminin\u2009+\u2009AXL expression was associated with reduced RFS, DMFS, OS and LMFS in TNBC patients (cf. Fig.\u00a05F\u2013H, and Suppl. Fig.\u00a012)Our study has some limitations. Although, we provide evidence for intrinsic ability in GemOE/TNBC tumor cells to recruit and activate stromal elements, such as MSCs and TAMs, the specific requirement of RAGE and AXL for the interaction with MSCs and TAMs, and the distinct biological role in different subtypes of the TNBC disease warrant further studies. Despite these limitations, our results suggest that RAGE and AXL are prognostic indicators of outcome in GemOE/TNBCs patients.Another limitation is the fact that direct testing for S100A4 in TAMs recruitment into GemOE/TNBC tumors should be done, in vivo. Although all the drugs used in this study are specific for their cognate target, their effect in our system should be tested in future studies to provide mechanistic insight, for instance, using the same assays except in cell lines harboring knockdown/knockout of these targets. Also, in future assays, we will assess whether the recruitment of M2-macrophages only or the macrophages, in general, is affected by imatinib, for example, using FACS analysis for the CD11b/F4/80 population within GemOE/TNBC tumors.Moreover, we demonstrated AXL-mediated elevation in CD151, \u03b13, and \u03b21-integrin expression and functional interaction enhance binding to ECM in vitro, which could also be the case on vessels within tumors. This observation would be consistent with previous reports suggesting AXL\u2019s role in breast cancer cells intravasation of the endothelium barrier into the bloodstream. Noteworthy here, in preliminary data (not shown), we found that \u03b21-integrin is phosphorylated in GemOE. An exciting possibility is that this phosphorylation is AXL- or AXL/CD151-driven. In support of the former, R428 abolished this phosphorylation event in GemOE cells (not shown). CD151 may also be a target along with c-Abl and AXL for therapy of GemOE/TNBC tumors.Our analysis showing the opposite effect for GemOE on \u03b24-integrin expression is intriguing. At present, the functional significance of this observation remains unknown. It is possible since \u03b13\u03b24-integrin is also a receptor for ECM binding in breast cancers, that \u03b24 is involved in the extravasation rather than the intravasation step of GemOE/TNBC metastatic spread, as described recently. This will be investigated further in a follow-up study. Another critical experiment that will also be reported in a soon to be published article is the importance of MSCs/CAFs in the proposed intravasation of GemOE/TNBC cells.These findings implicate synergistic signals simultaneously mediate multiple mechanisms in GemOE/TNBC intravasation. This study provides new understanding of the signaling pathways activated in GemOE/TNBC cells through interactions with stromal cells (MSCs/CAFs and M2-TAMs) that modulate the intravasation ability of tumor cells and underlines the importance of probing the process of tumor dissemination from an essential yet hitherto under-explored bi-directional interactions between GemOE/TNBC tumor cells and their microenvironmental cells. The dependence of tumor intravasation on the microenvironment provides yet another point of intervention to prevent tumor cell dissemination and patients\u2019 demise.MethodsCell cultureHuman MSCs were purchased from Texas A&M HSC COM Institute for Regenerative Medicine, expanded, and frozen down. THP-1 cells were purchased from ATCC (catalog number: TIB-202TM), expanded, and frozen down. For both cell types, one vial is usually propagated for \u22645 generations to perform experiments before a new vail is used. Parental HME cell line (i.e., normal HME, used as control through the studies performed here) was transfected with a retrovirus expressing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible geminin allele. Several clones from these cells were generated by antibiotic-selection, expanded, and tested for geminin expression. A clone named Gem9 overexpressing a level of geminin similar to that observed in breast cancer cell lines was selected to use further. Gem9 cells were orthotopically injected in Dox-supplemented female SCID mice mammary fat pads (n\u2009=\u200910) and the primary (1\u00b0)-geminin overexpressing tumors developed were collected and used to generate the 1\u00b0 geminin-overexpressing tumor cell lines we named; Gem197, Gem240, Gem256, Gem257, and Gem270. These cell lines were described earlier, and are usually maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotics, and 2\u2009\u00b5g/ml doxycycline to induce geminin expression will be used to perform the assays in this study.

Samples were collected in a covered test tube and allowed to clot undisturbed at RT for ~30\u2009min. The clot was then removed by centrifuging at 1,000\u20132,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The isolated serum is immediately transferred into a clean polypropylene tube aliquoted into 0.5\u2009\u00b5l aliquots and stored in \u221280\u2009\u00b0C.ELISA analysisWells of a PVC microtiter plate were coat with the antigen by pipetting 50\u2009\u03bcl of the conditioned medium (CM) or Serum (or dilution thereof in PBS) in triplicates and plate covered and incubated for overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After washing 3x with PBS, blocking of none-specific sites was done using 5% BSA in PBS incubated for ~2\u2009h at room temperature (RT) followed by 3x washing in PBS. Diluted 1\u00b0 antibody was added for 2\u2009hours at RT, followed by 3x washing in PBS. HRP-conjugated 2\u00b0 antibody diluted in blocking buffer was incubated 1\u2009hour at RT then 3x washed with PBS. Detection using OPD (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) tables and detection at 492\u2009nm was done.Cytokine arrayHME and HME/geminin cells were assessed for differential cytokine secretion using human cytokine antibody array (RayBio). Conditioned media from an equal number of HME and HME/geminin cells plated in a serum-free medium for 20\u2009h under standard conditions were used to perform according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and previously described.Co-culture experimentBoyden chambers (BD biosciences) of 8\u2009\u00b5m (for migration) or 0.4\u2009\u00b5m (for secretome) pore size were used. Certain cells (or their CM) were layered in the lower chamber with or without neutralizing antibodies, and test cells were layered in the transwell inserts. Cells migrated to the lower compartment of the Boyden chamber were counted and plotted 24\u2009h later. Occasionally, hypoxia was introduced.Conditioned media transfer experimentConditioned medium (CM) generated for analysis of secreted cytokines and surface receptor expression under normoxia (20% O2 for 24\u2009h), or hypoxia (1% O2 for 24\u2009h) conditions from an equal number of cells were transferred onto MSCs in the presence or absence of drugs or NeuAb. MSCs re-CM medium was transferred onto HME or GemOE cells with or without drugs or NeuAb for 24\u2009h to re-reconditioned. The resultant CM was then transferred to an equal number of THP1-macrophages for 24\u2009h to be re-re-reconditioned. Finally, this CM was re-added onto HME or GemOE cells for 24\u2009h. At every step, the receiving cells were seeded at equal numbers to avoid number variations discrepancies. At various points, ELISA on CM and western blot on membrane fractions or whole-cell extracts generated by sonication was done.Quantitative Real-time RT/PCRIn brief, 100\u2009ng of total RNA isolated using TRIzol was used for qRT/PCR using iScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) as previously described.

All experiments were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines and regulations. Six- to eight-week-old anesthetized immune-compromised Nu/Nu (Harlan) mice were injected with cells re-suspended in 100\u2009\u00b5l RPMI medium and Matrigel (1:1) using a 27-gauge needle orthotopically in the 2nd left mammary gland. Tumors were monitored weekly by i.p. injection of 100\u2009\u00b5l of D-luciferin (15\u2009mg/mL in PBS) and anesthetized mice using a mix of oxygen and isoflurane gas were photographed for luciferase in vivo signals with IVIS machine (Xenogen). Tumor volume was assessed twice weekly by caliper (Life Sciences) using the formula L.W/2 (L\u2009=\u2009longest and W\u2009=\u2009shortest diameter of the tumor). Tumor initiation was defined as the time when tumors were 3\u2009mm in diameter. Mice were sacrificed when the tumors reached <1.5\u2009cm3 in volume or at the indicated time points in Results. At the end of the experiments, mice were euthanized by compressed 100% CO2 gas, tumors and organs (e.g., lung) were resected, weighed, fixed in formalin, and later cut at 4\u2009\u00b5m for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Some tumor parts were flash-frozen for DNA, RNA, and protein preparation later. In some instances, from anesthetized mice (using a mix of oxygen and isoflurane gas), 200\u2009\u00b5l of blood was drawn from the heart before they were euthanized.In vivo drug treatmentsTumor-bearing mice were treated with the drugs, concentration, and routes indicated in Results.Preparation and injection of GFP-MSCs or -THP1sGFP-expressing MSCs or THP1 were generated using lentivirus GFP-expressing plasmid. Antibiotics selected clones were propagated and stored frozen. Tumor-bearing mice and treated as described in Results were intracardiac injected through the left ventricle. Following tumor resection, part of the tumor was dissociated using Collagenase I and the protocol used by, grown in culture for 24\u2009h to adhere, and GFP-cells were photographed, counted, and plotted using Prism 7\u00ae.Fluorescence IHCIHC was performed as previously described. Briefly, 5\u03bcm thick paraffin-embedded sections of tumor tissue excised from GemOE orthotopic mammary tumors were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed in PBS. Antigen retrieval for all antibodies was done using Sodium citrate buffer (10\u2009mM Sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0), 10\u2009min at 95\u2009\u00b0C. Slides were blocked with 10% normal serum (2\u00b0 antibody species) for 1\u2009h at RT, washed, and probed with 1\u00b0 antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Slides were exposed to Alexa Fluor 568 (red), and 488 (green) conjugated secondary antibody for 1\u2009h at RT and counterstained and mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI (Vector) and imaged under the fluorescence microscope.Overall survival (OS) and replace-free survival (RFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) analysisThe association of geminin alone or combined with the other factors was investigated for stratified patient cohorts using overall (OS) and relapse/recurrent- (RFS), or distant metastasis- (MFS), or lung metastasis- (LMFS) -free survival using the PROGgeneV2 - Pan-Cancer Prognostics Database (http://watson.compbio.iupui.edu/chirayu/proggene/database) or the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Statistical analysisComparisons of treatment outcomes were tested for statistical differences using the Student t-test for paired data. Additionally, SPSS software was used to perform the ANOVA test followed by a post hoc Bonferroni correction for comparing multiple groups. The association of mRNA transcript expression with various clinicopathological parameters was also analyzed. Statistical significance was assumed at a P-value are *\u22640.05, **\u22640.01 and ***\u22640.001.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationis available for this paper at 10.1038/s41598-019-55702-w.Author contributionsW. e.S. performed the in vivo experiments, analyzed all the data, interpreted all the data, and wrote the manuscript, D.R. performed some in vitro experiments, and J.K. performed statistical analysis.

        "title": "TGF-beta receptor type-2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts regulates breast cancer cell growth and survival and is a prognostic marker in pre-menopausal breast cancer.",
        "content": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a pleiotropic cytokine with the capability to act as tumour suppressor or tumour promoter depending on the cellular context. TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFBR2) is the ligand-binding receptor for all members of the TGF-\u03b2 family. Data from mouse model experiments demonstrated that loss of Tgfbr2 expression in mammary fibroblasts was linked to tumour initiation and metastasis. Using a randomised tamoxifen trial cohort including in total 564 invasive breast carcinomas, we examined TGFBR2 expression (n=252) and phosphorylation level of downstream target SMAD2 (pSMAD2) (n=319) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and assessed links to clinicopathological markers, prognostic and treatment-predictive values. The study revealed that CAF-specific TGFBR2 expression correlated with improved recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed CAF-TGFBR2 to be an independent prognostic marker (multivariate Cox regression, hazard ratio: 0.534, 95% (CI): 0.360-0.793, P=0.002). CAF-specific pSMAD2 levels, however, did not associate with survival outcome. Experimentally, TGF-\u03b2 signalling in fibroblasts was modulated using a TGF-\u03b2 ligand and inhibitor or through lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated TGFBR2-specific knockdown. To determine the role of fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway on breast cancer cells, we used cell contact-dependent cell growth and clonogenicity assays, which showed that knockdown of TGFBR2 in CAFs resulted in increased cell growth, proliferation and clonogenic survival. Further, in a mouse model transfected CAFs were co-injected with MCF7 and tumour weight and proportion was monitored. We found that mouse xenograft tumours comprising TGFBR2 knockdown fibroblasts were slightly bigger and displayed increased tumour cell capacity. Overall, our data demonstrate that fibroblast-related biomarkers possess clinically relevant information and that fibroblasts confer effects on breast cancer cell growth and survival. Regulation of tumour-stromal cross-talk through fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway may depend on fibroblast phenotype, emphasising the importance to characterise tumour microenvironment subtypes. ",

        "title": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Promotes the Differentiation of Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts, Induced by Breast Cancer Cells.",
        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "title": "Essential roles of the interaction between cancer cell-derived chemokine, CCL4, and intra-bone CCR5-expressing fibroblasts in breast cancer bone metastasis.",
        "content": "From a murine breast cancer cell line, 4T1, we established a subclone, 4T1.3, which consistently metastasizes to bone upon its injection into the mammary fat pad. 4T1.3 clone exhibited similar proliferation rate and migration capacity as the parental clone. However, the intra-bone injection of 4T1.3 clone caused larger tumors than that of the parental cells, accompanied with increases in fibroblast, but not osteoclast or osteoblast numbers. 4T1.3 clone displayed an enhanced expression of a chemokine, CCL4, but not its specific receptor, CCR5. CCL4 shRNA-transfection of 4T1.3 clone had few effects on its in vitro properties, but reduced the tumorigenicity arising from the intra-bone injection. Moreover, intra-bone injection of 4T1.3 clone caused smaller tumors in mice deficient in CCR5 or those receiving CCR5 antagonist than in wild-type mice. The reduced tumor formation was associated with attenuated accumulation of CCR5-positive fibroblasts expressing connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)/CCN2. Tumor cell-derived CCL4 could induce fibroblasts to express CTGF/CCN2, which could support 4T1.3 clone proliferation under hypoxic culture conditions. Thus, the CCL4-CCR5 axis can contribute to breast cancer metastasis to bone by mediating the interaction between cancer cells and fibroblasts in bone cavity.",

        "title": "Tumor-associated fibroblasts recruit blood monocytes into tumor tissue.",
        "content": "Tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) and tumor-associated macrophages are the main stromal components in desmoplastic breast tumors. These host cell types were extensively studied individually with regard to tumor development and progression but little is known about their reciprocal interactions. To elucidate the role of TAF in the recruitment of monocytes (MO) we designed a 3D co-culture system of multicellular fibroblast spheroids of different origin, co-cultured with MO suspensions from healthy donors. Spheroids of tumor-derived but not of normal fibroblasts were extensively infiltrated by MO. A linear correlation between number of infiltrated MO and number of MO applied per spheroid was shown, indicating a distinct migratory MO subpopulation (approximately 15%) within the peripheral blood MO pool. Our data imply that MO migration into fibroblastic tumor areas may partially result from high expression of CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), which was regulated by endogenous IL-6 as shown by neutralization experiments. The effect of CCL2 on MO migration was inhibited by CCL2 neutralizing antibody in tumor-derived fibroblast conditioned media in a Boyden chamber migration assay but not in spheroid culture. While this phenomenon needs further evaluation, our data clearly support the concept of fibroblasts as \"sentinel cells\" relevant for tumor progression.",

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The SUM-159 human triple negative cell line was obtained from Asterand Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA) and was cultured in HAMS:F12 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone 1% HEPES. The MCF7 luminal A human breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 10% FBS. Cell lines were authenticated via third party testing (IDEXX BioAnalytics, Columbia, MO, USA) between October 2018 and October 2019. The MCF10A cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 5% FBS + 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was obtained from Dr. Ann Chambers (London Health Science Centre, London, Canada) and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS. The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and bone marrow (BM) was immediately extracted and stained with primary anti-CD117-PE and anti-CD45-FITC antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Supplemental Figure S2.

Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and snap-frozen. RNA was isolated from lungs and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis to assess the expression of murine fibronectin (a), tenascin-c (b), periostin (c), MMP9 (d), collegen A1 (e), LOX (f) and CCL2 (g) (n = 15 mice/group). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. \u03b1 = significantly different from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls. \u03b2 = significantly different from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.005).The presence of a triple-negative SUM159 breast tumor modifies the soluble lung microenvironment to enhance breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and used for the generation of lung-conditioned media (LCM) as described previously. To assess migration, (a) SUM159 or (b) MCF7 cells were subjected to transwell migration assays for 18 h as described in the Materials & Methods. To assess proliferation, (c) SUM159 or (d) MCF7 cells were subjected to BrdU incorporation assays as described in the Materials & Methods.

Breast cancer-derived EVs were isolated from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines as described in the Materials and Methods and characterized as described in Supplemental Figure S4. Cell lines included non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D), three TN cell lines (MDA-MB-231 (231), SUM159 and LRCP17 (derived from a patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells.

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression.IntroductionThe cooperative interactions among tumor cells and reactive stroma strongly contribute to cancer development and progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been indicated as the main cellular component of the tumor microenvironment involved in cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis. In breast malignancies, CAFs exert a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapeutics through multiple mechanisms, including the stimulation of new blood vessels, mainly generated by a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Indeed, mechanisms of cell sensing and adaptation to stressful environments are activated within the hypoxic tumor mass, leading to the growth and aggressiveness of malignant cells. The transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) primarily mediates the cell responses to a low oxygen tension playing a crucial role in cancer development. In particular, HIF-1 activates a signaling transduction network which drives the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic conditions towards a more aggressive cancer phenotype. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein composed of the hypoxia-inducible \u03b1 subunit and the constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2 dimerize upon exposure to hypoxia, generating a complex which binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of target genes. In this regard, it has been shown that HIF-1 is a leading regulator of tumor angiogenesis following hypoxia, as it regulates the expression of several pro-angiogenic factors, like the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Recently, we discovered a further HIF-1-regulated gene, the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER), which contributes to the adaptation to a low oxygen environment in breast cancer cells and in cardiomyocytes. In particular, we found that the cooperation between GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 upon exposure to hypoxia leads to the up-regulation of the Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), which is a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER. Surprisingly, we also assessed that in CAFs derived from breast cancer malignancies GPER acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration. On the basis of these data, GPER-mediated functions may be included among the mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment.Considering that hypoxia regulates HIF-1\u03b1-dependent expression of both GPER and VEGF in different model systems, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential involvement of GPER in the expression and function of VEGF in CAFs and breast cancer cells. In this regard, we demonstrate that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates the up-regulation of VEGF as well as the endothelial tube formation, suggesting that this transduction pathway may be involved in the intricate stimulatory responses to hypoxia within the cancer stroma. Our data may open new perspectives towards innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the breast cancer microenvironment.Materials and methodsReagentsCobalt chloride (CoCl2) and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Srl (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) was obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). Human CTGF was purchased from MBL International Corporation, distributed by Eppendorf, (Milan, Italy). Human VEGF was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC, CTGF and VEGF, which were solubilized in water.Ethics statementAll procedures conformed to the Helsinki Declaration for the research on humans. The experimental research has been performed with the ethical approval provided by the Ethics Committee of the Regional Hospital in Cosenza, Italy.Cell culturesThe SkBr3 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The murine cardiomyocyte-like cell line HL-1 was kindly provided by Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA). In particular, the HL-1 cell line was established from a mouse atrial cardiomyocyte tumor excised from an adult female Jackson Laboratory-inbred C57BLy6J mouse (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). HL-1 cells were cultured according to the published protocol in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences, Sigma-Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% FBS (JRH Bioscience, Sigma-Aldrich Srl), 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), 0.1 mM norepinephrine (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded on collagen-coated flasks (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM) (Lonza, Milan, Italy), supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza, Milan, Italy). All cell lines were grown in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. For hypoxic stimulation, cells were treated with CoCl2 or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) in a HeraCell incubator (ThermoScientific-Heraeus, Milan, Italy). Cells were switched to medium without serum the day before experiments.Isolation, cultivation and characterization of CAFsCAFs were extracted from six invasive mammary ductal carcinomas obtained from mastectomies as previously described. Signed informed consent from all the patients and IRB approval were obtained. In particular, tissues obtained were cut into smaller pieces (1 to 2 mm diameter), placed in digestion solution (400 IU collagenase, 100 IU hyaluronidase and 10% FBS, containing antibiotics and antimycotics solution) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90 \u00d7 g for two minutes. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485 \u00d7 g for eight minutes, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham's F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) and cultured at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. In each patient, a second population of fibroblasts was isolated from a noncancerous breast tissue at least 2 cm from the outer tumor margin. CAFs and fibroblasts were then expanded into two 15-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for two to three population doublings within a total 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. We used CAFs and fibroblasts passaged for up to five population doublings for subsequent experiments to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. Primary cells cultures of breast fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were incubated with human anti-vimentin (V9) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001), all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy). In order to assess fibroblast activation, we used anti-fibroblast activated protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) antibody (H-56) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy) (data not shown). All experiments were performed in each CAF population obtained from six patients. Data presented were obtained in CAFs derived from one patient; however, results similar to those shown were found in CAFs derived from the other five patients.Gene reporter assaysThe 2.6 kb VEGF promoter-luciferase construct containing full-length VEGF promoter sequence (22,361 to +298 bp relative to the transcription start site) used in luciferase assays was a kind gift from Dr. Pal Soumitro (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA). CAFs or SkBr3 cells (1 \u00d7 105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 \u03bcL/well culture medium containing 10% FBS and transfected for 24 h with control shRNA, shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER. Next, a mixture containing 0.5 \u03bcg of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK was transfected within cells. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). After 8 h, cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed to low oxygen (2% O2) for 12 h in serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) normalized to the internal transfection control provided by Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle were set as one-fold induction, from which the activity induced by treatments was calculated.Gene expression studiesTotal RNA was extracted from cell cultures using the Trizol commercial kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and quality was checked by electrophoresis through agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were not degraded and showed clear 18S and 28S bands under ultraviolet light were used for RT-PCR. Total cDNA was synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The expression of selected genes was quantified by both real-time RT-PCR using Step One\u00ae sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Milan, Italy) and semiquantitative RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and are as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'-TGCATCTCCATCTTCTACCCAAGT-3' and Rev: 5'-CCGACTGTGAGTGCCACTGT-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'-ACACACCTGGGTGGACACAA-3' and Rev: 5'-GGAGCCAGAAGCCACATCTG-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ACCTGTGGGATGGGCATCT-3' and Rev: 5'-CAGGCGGCTCTGCTTCTCTA-3'; VEGF (human): Fwd: 5'- TGCAGATTATGCGGATCAAACC-3' and Rev: 5'- TGCATTCACATTTGTTGTGCTGTAG-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'- GGAGATCCTTCGAGGAGCACTT-3' and Rev: 5'- GGCGATTTA GCAGCAGATATAAGAA-3'; 18S (human, mouse) Fwd: 5'-GGCGTCCCCCAACTTCTTA-3' and Rev: 5'- GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTATT -3. The ribosomal protein 18S was used as a control gene to obtain normalized values.For semiquantitative PCR, primers were as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'- GCTGATTTGTGAACCCAT TC-3' and Rev: 5'- CTGTACTGTCCTGTGGTGAC-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'- CTGGGGAGTTTCCTG TCTGA -3' and Rev: 5'-GCTTGGGAAGTCACATCCAT-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ATGGCATGAAGCCAGAGAGT-3' and Rev: 3'-GGTCAGTGAGCACGCTAAAA-3'; VEGF (human) Fwd: 5'-GAGCTTCAGGACATTGCTGT-3' and Rev: 5'-AGGAAGGTCAACCACTCACA-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3' and Rev: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3'; 36B4 (human) Fwd: 5'-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3' and Rev: 5'-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGTCC-3'; GAPDH (mouse) Fwd: 5'-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3' and Rev: 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3'. 36B4 and GAPDH were used as control genes to obtain normalized values.Western blot analysisTo prepare lysates, CAFs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized with 50 mM Hepes solution, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined according to the Bradford method. Cell lysates (10 to 50 \u03bcg of protein) were electrophoresed through a reducing SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary polyclonal IgG antibody for HIF-1\u03b1 (R&D Systems, Inc., Celbio, Milan, Italy), GPER (N-15), CTGF (L-20), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), \u03b2-actin (C2), b-tubulin (H-235-2) and appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA). The levels of proteins and phosphoproteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and revealed using the ECL\u00ae System (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy).Gene silencing experimentsCells were plated onto 10 cm dishes and transfected for 24 h before treatments with a control vector or an independent shRNA sequence for each target gene using Fugene6 (Roche Diagnostics). The shRNA plasmid for HIF-1\u03b1 and the respective control plasmids were purchased from SABioscience Corporation (Frederick, MD, USA). The silencing of GPER expression was obtained by the construct which we have previously described and used.Immunofluorescence microscopyFifty percent confluent cultured CAFs, SkBr3 and HL-1 cells grown on coverslips were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed for 12 h to low oxygen tension (2% O2). Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight with a mouse primary antibody against VEGF (C-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), (1:1,000), (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and donkey anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:300; purchased from Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen). For knockdown experiments, cells were previously transfected for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and respective negative control plasmids (as described above) and then treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, or cultured under hypoxia as indicated. Leica AF6000 Advanced Fluorescence Imaging System supported by quantification and image processing software Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (Leica Microsystems CMS, GbH Mannheim, Germany) were used for experiment evaluation.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCAFs were grown in 10-cm dishes to 60 to 70% confluence, serum deprived for 24 h and then treated with vehicle or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY, USA) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primer for the -1,216 to -883 region of the human VEGF promoter containing the HRE site is 5'-CACAGACCTTCACAGCCATC-3' (forward hHRE) and 5'-CCCAGCGTAGACAGTTGAGT-3' (reverse hHRE). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation. For knockdown experiments CAFs were previously transfected in serum-free medium for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and the respective control shRNA (as described above) and then treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2.Migration assayMigration assays were performed with CAFs in triplicate using Boyden chambers (Costar Transwell, 8 mm polycarbonate membrane, Sigma Aldrich Srl). CAFs were transfected with shRNA constructs directed against HIF-1\u03b1, GPER or with an unrelated control shRNA construct in regular growth medium. After 24 h, cells were exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) or normoxia (20% O2) for 6 h in medium without serum. Then, cells were maintained for 24 h in normoxic conditions (20% O2) in medium without serum. This experimental condition has been designed in order to reproduce the unbalanced oxygenation occurring within solid tumors, where the irregular blood flow is responsible for hypoxia and reoxygenation phases. CAFs were, therefore, trypsinized and seeded in the upper chambers. CTGF (100 ng/mL) was added to the medium without serum in the bottom wells where applicable. Six hours after seeding, cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed and counted.Conditioned mediumCAFs were cultured in regular growth medium to 80% confluence. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS and transfected in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with shHIF-1\u03b1, shGPER or control shRNA using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions for 12 h. Thereafter, the culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in HUVECs.Protein precipitation with Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)Conditioned medium from CAFs (see above) was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and 10 \u03bcg/mL BSA (final concentration) was added as a control for precipitation efficiency. TCA (100% solution) was added to a final concentration of 20% to conditioned media. After a 20-minute incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 31,000 g for 20 minutes (4\u00b0C). Pellets were washed with cold acetone, centrifuged at 31,000 g for 30 minutes (4\u00b0C), air dried and resuspended in protein lysis buffer (described above). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford Method and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above, using 100 \u03bcg protein/lane.Tube formation assayThe day before the experiment, confluent HUVECs were starved overnight at 37\u00b0C in serum free medium (EBM, Lonza, Milan, Italy). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel\u00ae (Cultrex, Trevigen, Inc., Helgerman Court, Gaithersburg, USA) was thawed overnight at 4\u00b0C on ice, plated on the bottom of pre-chilled 96-well plates and left at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for gelification. Starved HUVECs were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, Invitrogen), counted and resuspended in conditioned medium from CAFs. Then, 10,000 cells/well were seeded on Matrigel\u00ae and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Tube formation was observed starting from 2 h after cell seeding and quantified by using the software NIH ImageJ (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls' testing to determine differences in means. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsHypoxia induces HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression in CAFsIn order to provide further insight into the response to hypoxia in main components of the tumor microenvironment like CAFs, we began our study showing that hypoxia induces the mRNA expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and its target gene GPER, as ascertained by real time PCR (Figure 1) and semi-quantitative PCR (data not shown). In particular, CAFs were treated from 1 h to 24 h with the hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl2 (100 \u03bcM) (Figure 1a) or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1b). The induction of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mRNA expression was paralleled by increased protein levels of these factors in CAFs treated from 1 h to 24 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 1c) or exposed to a low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1d). Next, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 expression, the induction of GPER by CoCl2 was abrogated (Figure 1e, Additional file 1a), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in CAFs exposed to hypoxic conditions. In order to assess the transduction signaling involved in the aforementioned responses, we determined the rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation (from 15 minutes up to 60 minutes) following the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 2a). Accordingly, we observed similar effects on ERK1/2 activation culturing CAFs in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (Figure 2b). Next, the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 30 minutes in the presence of 300 \u03bcM of the ROS scavenger NAC did not induce the ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2c). Moreover, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER observed treating CAFs for 3 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 was no longer evident in the presence of 300 \u03bcM NAC and 10 \u03bcM of the MEK inhibitor PD (Figure 2d). On the basis of these results, it could be argued that hypoxia-induced ROS may trigger the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is involved in the up-regulation of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression.Hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs. (a-d) The exposure to 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a, c) or low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 3 h) (b, d) up-regulate the mRNA (a, b) and protein (c, d) expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER as evaluated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. In RNA experiments, values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. (e) The up-regulation of GPER observed treating CAFs for 6 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. Side panel shows densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.Hypoxia stimulates the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER through ERK1/2 activation in CAFs. The treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a) or the exposure to low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (b) induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is prevented by using 300 \u03bcM of the free radical scavenger NAC (c). (d) Immunoblots of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER from CAFs treated for 3 h with vehicle (-) or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 alone and in combination with 300 \u03bcM NAC or 10 \u03bcM ERK1/2 inhibitor PD. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to ERK/2 or \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cultured under normoxia vs cells treated with CoCl2 or cells cultured under hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the expression of VEGF induced by hypoxiaConsidering the ability of a low oxygen environment to trigger the production of pro-angiogenic factors in solid tumors, we aimed to evaluate whether hypoxia may promote the expression of an important HIF-1\u03b1 target gene like VEGF. As shown in Figure 3a, the treatment with CoCl2 induced the mRNA expression of VEGF in a time-dependent manner in both CAFs and SkBr3 breast cancer cells. Similar results were obtained in a completely different model system, such as HL-1 cardiomyocytes (Additional file 2). Next, CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) activated a VEGF promoter reporter gene which was transfected in CAFs and SkBr3 cells (Figure 3b, c). Notably, the aforementioned transcriptional response to hypoxia was abrogated knocking-down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 3d, e and Additional file 1c, d). CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) promoted also VEGF protein expression in CAFs, as evidenced by immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 4). The induction of VEGF protein levels was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 5 and Additional file 1a, b), further highlighting their involvement in the regulation of VEGF by hypoxia. Analogously, the up-regulation of VEGF protein expression upon exposure to hypoxia in SkBr3 (Figure 6a) and HL-1 cells (Figure 7a) was no longer evident, knocking down the expression of GPER (Figures 6b and 7b and Additional file 1e) and HIF-1 \u03b1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the regulation of VEGF expression induced by hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation of VEGF. (a) The mRNA expression of VEGF is up-regulated in CAFs and SkBr3 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as evaluated by real-time PCR. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle (-). Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SD. (b) The VEGF promoter plasmid (pVEGF) is transactivated in CAFs and SkBr3 cells treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 12 h (b) or exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) for 12 h (c). The transactivation of the VEGF promoter observed in SkBr3 cells treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER expression (e). The luciferase activities were normalized to the internal transfection control and values of cells receiving vehicle or cultured under normoxia were set as one-fold induction upon which the activities induced by CoCl2 treatment or hypoxia were calculated. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

Interestingly, GPER was required for the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the promoter of VEGF, as evidenced knocking-down the expression of GPER (Figure 8c). In parallel, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the recruitment of GPER to the HRE site within the VEGF promoter sequence (Figure 8d). Altogether, these findings suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER leads to the hypoxia-induced transcription of VEGF.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are recruited to the VEGF promoter sequence. CAFs treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 were submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (a) or anti-GPER (b) antibodies. For knockdown experiments, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA and shGPER (c) or with control shRNA and shHIF-1\u03b1 (d), treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 and then submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (c) or anti-GPER (d) antibodies. The amplified sequences were evaluated by real-time PCR. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle vs CoCl2 treatment.On the basis of these data, we then examined whether conditioned medium from hypoxia-stimulated CAFs could promote in HUVECs the formation of tubule-like structures that represent a useful model system for the evaluation of the neoangiogenesis process. In particular, HUVECs were cultured on GFR-Matrigel\u00ae-coated plates which prevent the formation of capillary-like structures, as previously reported. Notably, HUVECs cultured in normoxic medium from CAFs did not assemble into cord-like structures, while HUVECs grown in medium from CAFs maintained in hypoxic conditions (2% O2 for 12 h) displayed a complex ramified network of tubules (Figure 9a). Moreover, in HUVECs cultured with hypoxic medium (2% O2 for 12 h) collected from CAFs, which were previously transfected with a shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER, tube formation was no longer observed (Figure 9b, c). The addition of 10 ng/mL VEGF to the hypoxic medium from GPER-silenced CAFs restored the ability to form tubule structures in HUVECs (Figure 9c). The aforementioned findings were quantified and recapitulated in Additional file 3. Next, we determined that the up-regulation of VEGF protein levels in hypoxic medium from CAFs is no longer evident, knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Additional file 4). Hence, these results clearly suggest that VEGF may be considered as a target of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced tube formation. Tube formation was evaluated in HUVECs cultured for 2 h in medium collected from CAFs which were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). To this end, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA (a), shHIF-1\u03b1 (b) or shGPER (c) and exposed to hypoxia, as indicated. Tube formation is rescued in HUVECs treated with 10 ng/mL VEGF and cultured in medium from CAFs transfected with shGPER and cultured under hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). Data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFsIn order to further corroborate the stimulatory role exerted by HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in hypoxic conditions, we turned to a different model system. CoCl2 and low oxygen tension (2% O2) induced CTGF up-regulation at both mRNA (Figure 10a) and protein level (Figure 10b, c) in CAFs. Silencing HIF-1\u03b1 as well as knocking down GPER expression, the up-regulation of CTGF upon CoCl2 was abolished (Figure 10d, e). As a biological counterpart, the migration of CAFs cultured under low oxygen tension (2% O2) was prevented, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression and rescued, adding CTGF (Figure 10f). Collectively, our data may suggest that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates different biological outcomes in CAFs exposed to hypoxia.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFs. (a) The mRNA expression of CTGF is induced after the stimulation of CAFs with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as indicated. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. The protein expression of CTGF is induced by 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (b) or low oxygen tension (2% O2, for 4 h) (c). The up-regulation of CTGF protein expression observed upon 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 treatment is abrogated silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER (e) expression. The migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) is prevented knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression. Cell migration is rescued in CAFs transfected with shGPER, exposed to hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) and treated with 100 ng/ml CTGF (f). Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.DiscussionIn the present study, we provide novel evidence regarding the regulation of VEGF, which plays a fundamental role in mediating hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis. In particular, our results demonstrate that a low oxygen tension stimulates through the ERK1/2 transduction pathway the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent expression of GPER, which contributes to the regulation of VEGF in both CAFs and breast cancer cells. Moreover, we show that following hypoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter region and cooperatively act as a functional complex for the transcription of VEGF. As a biological counterpart, we evidence that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mediate endothelial tube formation in HUVECs cultured in medium from CAFs which were previously exposed to hypoxia. Further corroborating these findings, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER regulates the expression of the migratory factor CTGF, which has been acknowledged as a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.HIF-1 is a master regulator of cellular adaptation to oxygen deprivation and acts as a survival factor in hypoxic tumor environment, mainly activating the transcription of genes involved in glycolytic metabolism, oxygen consumption, cell migration and invasion. Besides, hypoxia stimulates through HIF-1 the expression of anti-apoptotic, proliferative and angiogenic factors that drastically change the biological properties of tumor cells towards malignant features. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that GPER may be included among the HIF-1 target genes as the up-regulation of GPER induced by hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in breast cancer cells and cardiomyocytes. In particular, GPER-mediated the antiapoptotic effects exerted by estrogens in hypoxic conditions, suggesting that this receptor may contribute to the adaptation of cancer cells to a low oxygen environment.GPER may be considered as a predictor of cancer malignancy and aggressiveness considering that its expression has been associated with negative clinical features and poor survival rates in diverse types of tumors. Therefore, huge efforts are currently underway to unravel the mechanisms that rule its regulation and function. Indeed, the development and characterization of drugs that target key players of cancer progression like GPCRs, and particularly GPER, are currently innovative topics under investigation.In this context, estrogenic GPER signaling has been shown to trigger relevant biological effects like proliferation and migration in diverse cancer cells and in CAFs derived from breast tumors. Notably, GPER exhibited the peculiar property to act in CAFs as a transcriptional regulator together with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hence leading to the up-regulation of Cyclin D, which has been largely involved in cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has suggested that CAFs may drive cancer phenotype mainly through a paracrine action exerted by the production of various growth factors and chemokines secreted in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the stromal contribution to the development of a wide variety of tumors has been supported by animal models of cancer pathogenesis and extensive clinical studies. In this vein, it has been shown that malignant cells recruit into the tumor mass diverse stromal components like CAFs, inflammatory and vascular cells that actively cooperate towards cancer progression. In particular, CAFs elicit in breast carcinomas relevant biological activities, including the stimulation of new blood vessels formation, which closely correlates with cancer growth, metastasis and poor prognosis. In this context, our present data add a further mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment may promote angiogenesis, as the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling was shown to mediate the up-regulation of VEGF expression in CAFs cultured in hypoxic conditions. Considering that VEGF is one of the most important factors mediating the complex process of angiogenesis, its action has been widely involved in the development of many types of tumors, including breast cancer. Accordingly, it has been shown that the ectopic expression of VEGF in MCF-7 breast cancer cells may promote tumor growth in vivo , whereas the blockade of VEGF has been associated with the growth arrest of breast carcinomas in nude mice. Thus, given the crucial role exerted by VEGF in tumor development and prognosis, a great deal of interest is currently addressed to a better understanding of its regulation and function. In this regard, VEGF was shown to be regulated by hypoxia mainly through HIF-1\u03b1, which may interact with numerous factors to boost VEGF expression. Further extending the current knowledge on the complex regulation of VEGF, our data suggest that GPER may contribute to the HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcriptional responses in hypoxic tumor microenvironment towards new blood vessel formation. Notably, an increased VEGF production was recently shown to parallel an elevated GPER expression in endometrial cancer patients with low survival rates. These data in combination with our findings may suggest that in estrogen-dependent cancer cells diverse molecular mechanisms could converge on the production of cytokines and growth factors, promoting an enhancement of malignant epithelial growth and invasion through autocrine and/or paracrine pathways. Interestingly, we have determined that the up-regulation of VEGF relied on HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling also in HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that this transduction mechanism may be implicated in additional pathophysiological conditions, such as the hypoxic myocardium. In this regard, it should be mentioned that recent studies have suggested a cardioprotective role exerted by GPER in stressful conditions following hypoxia. These data in combination with the results obtained in the present study may indicate that GPER could elicit cardiotropic effects also through its ability to regulate the expression of VEGF, which mainly contributes to adaptive responses following myocardial ischemic injury.As it concerns the signaling cascades activated by hypoxia, we here demonstrate that the ROS-mediated ERK1/2 activation is involved in the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression upon low oxygen tension. In this regard, it should be mentioned that ROS play a relevant role in the biological responses to re-oxygenation; however, decreased oxygen levels may be sufficient to trigger HIF-1-dependent gene expression through the ROS production. In addition, the rapid responses to hypoxia are mediated by multiple transduction pathways activated also upon GPER stimulation. Further studies are needed to better clarify the functional cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER, particularly following both hypoxic and estrogenic stimulations. For instance, estrogens regulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression and function in a stressful environment, indicating an intricate cooperation between these two main factors mainly involved in tumor progression. Interestingly, in the current investigation, the biological interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER upon hypoxic conditions was corroborated by the up-regulation of an important migratory stimulator and GPER target gene like CTGF. Accordingly, the migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression, hence confirming their contribution to this relevant cell response.The results obtained in the current study may also disclose a unique ligand-independent action elicited by GPER. This issue could be a further attractive topic which remains to be elucidated in future studies.Altogether, our findings recapitulate in CAFs exposed to hypoxia the engagement of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling towards the regulation of pivotal genes involved in angiogenic and metastatic processes. Anyway, further studies are required to better define the role exerted by this transduction pathway in diverse pathophysiological conditions as well as the molecular mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia through the functional interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.ConclusionsWithin the tumor microenvironment exposed to hypoxia, CAFs have been involved in the generation of new blood vessels which mainly support cancer progression. Our current data highlight the stimulatory role exerted by the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in the multistep process of tumor neoangiogenesis fostered by CAFs. Considering the crucial interplay between cancer cells and stroma, the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway may be pointed out as a further biological target towards innovative treatments in breast cancer.AbbreviationsCAFs: Carcinoma activated fibroblasts; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; CoCl2: cobalt chloride; DAPI: 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; EGM: endothelial growth medium; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAP\u03b1: fibroblast activated protein \u03b1; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GPER: G-Protein estrogen receptor; HIF-1: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1; HREs: hypoxia-responsive elements; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; N-acetyl-L-cysteine; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; TCA: trichloroacetic acid; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsEMDF designed and performed the experiments, and wrote the paper.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown.

Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

        "content": "Whereas the accumulation of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast cancer is a well-documented phenomenon and correlates with metastatic disease, the functional contributions of these stromal cells on breast cancer progression still remain largely unclear. Previous studies have uncovered a potentially important role for CCL2 inflammatory chemokine signaling in regulating metastatic disease through a macrophage-dependent mechanism. In these studies, we demonstrate a significant regulatory mechanism for CCL2 expression in fibroblasts in mediating mammary tumor progression and characterize multiple functions for CCL2 in regulating stromal-epithelial interactions. Targeted ablation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) type 2 receptor in fibroblasts (Tgfbr2(FspKO)) results in a high level of secretion of CCL2, and cografts of Tgfbr2(FspKO) fibroblasts with 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells enhanced tumor progression associated with recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Antibody neutralization of CCL2 in tumor-bearing mice inhibits primary tumor growth and liver metastases as evidenced by reduced cell proliferation, survival, and TAM recruitment. Both high and low stable expressions of small interfering RNA to CCL2 in Tgfbr2(FspKO) fibroblasts significantly reduce liver metastases without significantly affecting primary tumor growth, cell proliferation, or TAM recruitment. High but not low knockdown of CCL2 enhances tumor cell apoptosis. These data indicate that CCL2 enhances primary tumor growth, survival, and metastases in a dose-dependent manner, through TAM-dependent and -independent mechanisms, with important implications on the potential effects of targeting CCL2 chemokine signaling in the metastatic disease.",

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs.

The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

Data are shown as relative expression of the miRNAs. Standard deviations were calculated on technical duplicates. The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008). (C) Histograms of qRT-PCR results showing the basal expression levels of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 in NFs compared with CAFs. Data are shown as relative expression of miRNAs folded on NFs. Standard deviations were calculated with replicates from two independent experiments performed on four different primary NF cells (pt. #1, #2, #3, and #4) and four different primary CAF cells (pt. #81, #82, #87, and #89). The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027). (D) Representative images of the EXOmotif analysis with MDS software showing a short motif (3\u20135 nt) in miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 sequences, predictive of their active loading into exosomes. (E) Western blot showing overexpression of FAP, Caveolin-1, and MCT4 proteins in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs compared with control (scrambled [Scra]) after 72 h. (F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

(E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

In addition, upregulation of both NOTCH1 and CCL2 was associated with poor differentiation in primary BCs, further supporting the observation that NOTCH1 is regulated by CCL2. Our findings therefore suggest that CCL2 represents a potential therapeutic target that can block the cancer-host communication that prompts CSC-mediated disease progression.IntroductionRecent studies indicate that a subset of cancer cells possessing stem cell properties, referred to as cancer-initiating or cancer stem cells (CSCs), play crucial roles in tumor initiation, progression and therapeutic refractoriness. Similar to embryonic and somatic stem cells, the self-renewal and differentiation of CSCs are simultaneously regulated by intrinsic (cancer cell-endowed) and extrinsic (microenvironmental) factors. Despite the increasing number of studies on genes and pathways involved in cancer \u201cstemness\u201d, factors in the tumor microenvironment that regulate CSCs, and how cancer cells, in turn, modify the niche by influencing their neighboring cells remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we focus on the regulation of CSCs by stromal fibroblasts, an important cellular component of the tumor-hosting niche in many human cancers, especially breast cancer (BC). Fibroblasts release a variety of growth factors, chemokines, and components of the extracellular matrix into the microenvironment and influence the differentiation and homeostasis of adjacent epithelia. Reconstitution of human-specific mammary glands in cleared mouse mammary fat pads using stem-cell-enriched human mammary epithelial cell organoids requires co-injection of human mammary fibroblasts, suggesting a critical role for fibroblasts in regulating stem cell functions. Fibroblasts interplay with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression through complex paracrine mechanisms. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer progression by modulating multiple components in the cancer niche to build a permissive and supportive microenvironment for tumor growth and invasion.In the current study, we observed robust induction of the stem-cell-like mammosphere-forming phenotype in BC cells co-cultured with CAFs. The CSC-stimulating effect was attributed to the increased secretion of CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1; MCP-1) by CAFs when compared to normal cell-associated fibroblasts (NAFs). CCL2 signals through the G protein-coupled receptor chemokine (C-C motif) receptors CCR2 and CCR4, and is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and other immune cells to areas of inflammation. Both monocytes and non-monocytic cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, secrete CCL2 in response to cytokine stimulation. Cancer cells also frequently overexpress CCL2 in order to modify their local environment. Here, we further found that CCL2 induced the self-renewal of CSCs by inducing NOTCH1 expression at both RNA and protein levels. NOTCH signaling has been recognized as a key regulator in normal and malignant stem cells from various tissues, including the breast. Upon ligand binding, NOTCH receptors are activated by sequential cleavages involving members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) protease family (\u03b1-secretases) and \u03b3-secretase. These cleavage events result in translocation of the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) to the nucleus, where it acts on downstream targets. Our identification of NOTCH-mediated activation by tumor environmental factor CCL2 therefore presents a unique mode of niche-conferred regulation of CSCs. These findings further emphasize the importance of simultaneously targeting cancer cells and events within the tumor microenvironment, such as production of CCL2 by stromal cells, in future anti-cancer therapies that also incorporate the latest stem cell research.Materials and MethodsTissue sources and cell purificationHuman BC tissues were obtained from consented patients at City of Hope Medical Center (Duarte, CA) under approved institutional review board protocols. Tissues were mechanically and enzymatically dissociated, and epithelial tumor cells and fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated as previously described. Briefly, BC tissue was mechanically minced into small pieces, placed in digestion solution containing collagenase III (Worthington Biochemical Corporation; Lakewood, NJ) and DNase I (AppliChem; St. Louis, MO), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2\u20133 h with occasional pipetting. The cells were separated by differential centrifugation at 90 \u00d7g for 2 min. The epithelial (tumor) cells in the pellet were cultured in Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Media (Invitrogen; Grand Island, NY) containing 0.7 mM L-glutamine (Mediatech/Cellgro; Manassas, VA), 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Lonza; Allendale, NJ), 5 \u03bcg/ml transferrin (Lonza), 5 ng/ml selenium (Lonza), and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA Laboratories; Dartmouth, MA). The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 800 \u00d7g for 10 min, resuspended and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (Mediatech/Cellgro) containing 10% FBS on a non-treated dish. Purity of primary tumor cells and CAFs were confirmed by expression of Epithelial Specific Antigen (ESA) and Vimentin, respectively, in flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays (Fig. S1). CAF265922 (primary CAFs) and XP265922 (primary tumor cells) were isolated from a primary triple-negative BC that was resistant to the chemotherapy regimen containing cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel. CAF3 were isolated from a primary HER2-positive BC for which the primary tumor cells were not available. Normal human mammary fibroblasts (NAF2) were purchased from ScienCell (Carlsbad, CA). For immunohistochemistry in primary breast tumors, pretreatment core biopsies or surgical specimens were obtained from patients with HER2-positive (31 cases) or triple-negative (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212; 20 cases) BC. Specimens were collected and processed for formalin fixation and paraffin embedding in a time frame that would preserve the integrity of protein epitopes.Cell lines, plasmids and virusesHuman BC cell lines BT474, MDA-MB-361 (MDA361) and MCF7, and the non-cancerous mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in the recommended media in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. Recombinant human CCL2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The STAT3 inhibitor Stattic, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and \u03b3-secretase inhibitor DAPT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The \u03b1-secretase inhibitor INCB3619 was provided by Incyte Corporation (Wilmington, DE). For conditional knockdown of CCL2, the shRNA targeting the CCL2 mRNA (TRCN0000006283) was constructed into the pTIG (pHIV7-TetR-IRES-GFP) lentiviral vector (kindly provided by Dr. Rossi) downstream of a Dox inducible U6 promoter, as described elsewhere. GFP-labeled CAF265922 were generated using pBABE-GFP retroviral vector. Production of viruses, as well as infection and selection of CAFs were carried out as previously described.Mammosphere formation assayPlease see Supplemental Materials for procedures.RNA extraction, reverse transcription (RT) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)Please see Supplemental Materials for procedures.Cytokine antibody array and Western blot analysesPlease see Supplemental Materials for procedures.Cell transfection, reporter assays, and RNAi studiesPlease see Supplemental Materials for procedures.Flow cytometry and cell sortingSingle-cell suspensions prepared from tumors or cell culture were stained with APC-conjugated human ESA antibody (Catalog #347200; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or analyzed by ALDEFLUOR assay kit (Catalog #01700; Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Flow cytometry assays were performed using a CyAn ADP cytometer (Dako; Carpinteria, CA) and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar; Ashland, OR). Electronic cell sorting based on intensity of GFP, APC, PKH67 or ALDEFLUOR was done on a FACSAriaIII cell sorter (BD Biosciences).XenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at City of Hope. Please see Supplemental Materials for procedures.Immunohistochemistry (IHC)IHC staining of formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary or xenograft tumor tissues was performed as previously reported using the following antibodies and dilutions: human CCL2 (Catalog #ab9669; Abcam; Cambridge, MA), 1:75 dilution; NOTCH1 (for primary BC: Catalog #1935-1; Epitomics; Burlingame, CA; for xenograft tumors: Catalog #3608; Cell Signaling; Danvers, MA), 1:40 dilution; and SMA (Catalog #ab5694; Abcam), 1:100 dilution. For CCL2 and SMA, cytoplasmic staining was evaluated and for NOTCH1 nuclear staining was evaluated. Stained slides were scored according to intensity of staining (-: 0; +: 1; ++: 2; and +++: 3) and percentage of tumor cells staining positive for each antigen (0%: 0; 1~30%: 1; 31~70%: 2; and >70%: 3). The score for the intensity of immunostaining was multiplied by the score for the percentage of cells staining positive to obtain a final score, which was used in the statistical correlation analysis of CCL2 and NOTCH1.Statistical analysesAll quantitative data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). All results were confirmed in at least three independent experiments, and data from one representative experiment was shown. The statistical analysis was performed using a SPSS 13.0 software package. Student t test or ANOVA test was used for comparison of quantitative data. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant. The differential expression of CCL2, CCR2 and NOTCH family of receptors and ligands between Grade 3 and Grade 1 BCs were analyzed using a logistic regression model after which an odds ratio (OR) was reported. For example, an OR of 13.72 (CCL2) means that tumors with each unit increase in CCL2 expression are 13.72 times more likely to be Grade 3, rather than Grade 1 (95% CI = 2.66\u201370.89). The linear dependence between CCL2 and NOTCH1 expression was evaluated by Pearson (for the microarray dataset) or Spearman correlation coefficient (for the IHC dataset). The microarray gene expression data and associated clinical data were extracted from a published 295 BC dataset.ResultsCAF-derived CCL2 induces the stem-cell-like mammosphere-forming phenotype in BC cellsThe mammosphere assay has been used to functionally characterize and enrich normal and malignant stem cells from the breast, relying on the unique feature of stem cells to escape anoikis and grow into spheres in anchorage-independent conditions. Using this approach, we examined the sphere-forming efficiency (SFE) in BT474 BC cells in the presence or absence of co-cultured primary human mammary NAFs or CAFs. Compared to the BC cells that were cultured alone, co-culture with CAFs, but not NAFs, significantly increased mammosphere formation in BC cells (Fig. 1A). When NAFs and CAFs were first \u201cactivated\u201d in vitro by co-culturing with BT474 cells before being transferred to the mammosphere co-culture, both activated NAFs and the CAFs that were continuously activated by BC cells in vitro were able to induce BT474 mammosphere formation to a greater extent than their pre-activation counterparts (Fig. 1A). The mammosphere-inducing effect was also observed with the conditioned medium (CM) harvested from CAFs, but not NAFs. CM from CAFs that were further activated by BT474 or MDA361 BC cells exhibited an enhanced capacity for inducing mammosphere formation. In vitro activation of NAFs also resulted in mammosphere-inducing activity in the CM, which was more significant in NAFs that had been co-cultured with BT474 cells for a prolonged 10-day period (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the continuous activation of stromal fibroblasts by BC cells leads to secretion of fibroblast-derived soluble factors that can induce the CSC-like phenotype.To identify these soluble factors, we performed a cytokine array assay using the CM of untreated and BT474-treated CAFs. Significant induction of CCL2 was observed following in vitro activation of CAFs (Fig. 1C). At the RNA level, expression of CCL2 was induced in CAFs 7 to 9-fold in response to activation by various BC cells, with BC-activated CAFs producing the highest amounts of CCL2 among various cell types, including NAFs and BC cells. Treatment of CAFs with the non-cancerous MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells, as well as short-term (3-day) treatments of NAFs with BC cells only modestly induced CCL2 expression (Fig. 1D). To examine the direct effect of CCL2 on CSCs, we added increasing amounts of recombinant CCL2 to various BC cells, and observed dose-dependent formation of mammospheres in BT474 and MDA361, but not MCF7 cells (Fig. 1E). Using a neutralizing antibody for CCL2, we further showed that depletion of functional CCL2 from the CM of activated CAFs abolished the CSC-inducing activity (Fig. 1F). Thus, we concluded that BC-activated CAFs regulate CSCs through expression and secretion of higher levels of CCL2.CCL2 induces the self-renewing expansion of CSCsThe sphere-initiating CSCs are maintained in the primary mammospheres through self-renewal, and are able to give rise to secondary mammospheres when cells from the primary spheres are dissociated and allowed to grow in anchorage-independent conditions. We therefore examined the effect of CCL2 on CSC self-renewal by secondary mammosphere culture. Interestingly, compared to the control spheres that had not been treated with CCL2, the first-passage spheres that had been treated with CCL2 contained higher numbers of CSCs capable of initiating secondary spheres, even in the absence of continuous CCL2 treatment (Fig. 2A). Based on this result, we hypothesized that CCL2 either promoted the self-renewal (to cause a self-renewing expansion) of existing CSCs, or, alternatively, promoted the conversion of non-CSCs to CSCs. These possibilities were examined using a reported approach involving the labeling of an initial cell population with PKH fluorescent dye and tracking the serial dilution of fluorescence in single-cell-formed spheres during the cell division events in mammosphere formation. Because the PKH dye binds to cell membranes and segregates in daughter cells after each cell division, the PKH fluorescence intensity of each cell in a sphere reflects its proliferation history. The PKHhigh cells, therefore, represent the stem cell population that has undergone a limited number of divisions during sphere formation, in contrast to the non-stem, PKHlow cells that are highly proliferative. Using PKH67-labeled BT474 cells, we generated primary mammospheres containing cells with various PKH67 intensities. In the absence of CCL2 treatment, about 50% of mammospheres carried 1 PKH67high cell per sphere, and about 33% and 13% carried 2 and 3 PKH67high cells, respectively. This distribution was altered in CCL2-treated spheres, where the percentage of spheres carrying a single PKH67high cell decreased to 28%, and of those carrying 3 or more PKH67high cells significantly increased (Fig. 2B). In spheres carrying multiple PKH67high cells, the PKH67high cells also exhibited slightly dimmer fluorescence comparing to those in spheres carrying single PKH67high cells (Fig. 2B and S2), likely indicating one or two more rounds of division (and PKH67 dilution) of the PKH67high cells before entering the stem-cell-like, slow-proliferating or quiescent state in the multi-PKH67high-cell spheres. The overall population of PKH67high cells in dissociated sphere cells was also ~2-fold higher in CCL2-treated spheres than untreated spheres, as determined by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 2C). When the PKH67high and PKH67low sphere cells were purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the PKH67high primary sphere cells exhibited the highest SFE in the secondary mammosphere formation assay when compared to the PKH67low cells (Fig. 2D), consistent with their CSC property. CCL2 treatment did not alter the SFE of PKH67low and PKH67high cells in the secondary sphere formation (Fig. 2D), indicating that CCL2 does not cause conversion of non-CSCs (PKH67low) to CSCs (sphere-initiating). Therefore, we conclude that CCL2 regulates CSCs by inducing their self-renewing expansion. Interestingly, a similar effect has been previously described for NOTCH activation on stem cells. The role of NOTCH pathway in mediating CSC regulation by CCL2 was further investigated in Fig. 4.Paracrine signaling of cancer-secreted cytokines induces CCL2 production in fibroblasts via STAT3 activationWe then set out to identify the mechanism underlying increased CCL2 production in BC-activated CAFs. STAT3 has been recently reported to bind to and activate the promoter of CCL2. To determine if BC cells induce CCL2 expression in fibroblasts through STAT3 activation, we first examined the effects of BC-derived CM and a STAT3 inhibitor on a previously reported CCL2 promoter reporter and on CCL2 expression in CAFs freshly isolated from a triple-negative (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212) primary BC (CAF265922). CM from BC cells, including BT474, MDA361 and the primary BC cells isolated from the same BC specimen (XP265922), but not from MCF10A cells, markedly induced luciferase expression driven by the CCL2 promoter (Fig. 3A), as well as endogenous expression of CCL2 (Fig. 3B). These effects were abrogated by addition of the STAT3 inhibitor (Fig. 3A and 3B), indicating STAT3 involvement in mediating the induction of fibroblast-derived CCL2 expression. Similar results were also obtained using CAFs from a different primary BC (Fig. S3). Indeed, high levels of STAT3 phosphorylation were observed in CAFs as early as 30 min following treatment with BC-derived, but not MCF10A-derived, CM (Fig. 3C). The induction of CCL2 expression was sustained over a time course of 5 days in CAFs co-cultured with BC cells, and was abolished by inhibition of STAT3 (Fig. S4). Although CM from BT474, MDA361 and primary BC cells all induced STAT3 phosphorylation and CCL2 expression in CAFs, different cytokines were detected in the CM of BT474 and MDA361 (Fig. 3D). In either case, multiple cytokines with reported STAT3-activating effect were detected, suggesting that the STAT3 activation observed in BC-treated CAFs was likely a combined effect of various BC-secreted cytokines. Thus, BC cells derived from different origins and secreting different cytokines activate the STAT3 core pathway in fibroblasts of the tumor microenvironment, leading to STAT3-mediated promoter activation of CCL2.CCL2 induces CSCs by activating NOTCH signalingTo explore the molecular basis for CCL2-mediated regulation of CSCs, we surveyed the CCL2 responsiveness of genes involved in NOTCH, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and Hedgehog pathways, which are known to regulate stem cells. We found that expression of NOTCH1 and a target gene of NOTCH signaling, HES1, were induced by CCL2 in various BC cells, and that HES1 expression occurred subsequent to NOTCH1 expression (Fig. 4A and 4B). Interestingly, the NOTCH-activating effect of CCL2 was only subtle in MCF7 cells, which also failed to respond to CCL2-induced sphere formation (Fig. 1E). This may be related to the lower expression level of CCR2 in MCF7 compared to other cells (Fig. S5), making MCF7 less sensitive to CCL2-triggered effects. Transfected HES1 and HEY1 reporters were significantly activated by CCL2 in primary BC cells and BT474 cells, and these effects were abolished by inhibitors of the NOTCH-activating \u03b1- and \u03b3-secretases (Fig. 4C and S6). Activation of NOTCH signaling by CCL2 was thus attributed to increased NOTCH1 expression, as CCL2 showed no effect on the activities of \u03b1- and \u03b3-secretases as assessed by in vitro substrate cleavage assays (Fig. S7). Upon CCL2 treatment, a rapid and dramatic induction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation was observed, followed by the induction of NOTCH1 and NICD1 (cleaved NOTCH1) proteins at a later time point (Fig. 4D). Both p38 phosphorylation and NOTCH1/NICD1 induction were abolished by an inhibitor of p38 MAPK (Fig. 4D and 4E). Using a 6-kb NOTCH1 promoter reporter, we observed a ~4-fold induction of NOTCH1 promoter activity by CCL2 in primary BC cells, and this effect was also completely suppressed by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, but only partially suppressed by inhibitors of PI3K and MEK1/2 MAPK (Fig. 4F). This suggests that p38 MAPK plays an essential role in activating NOTCH1 promoter, whereas PI3K and MEK1/2 MAPK may play an accessory role. Induction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and NOTCH1 proteins (full-length and cleaved) was also observed in XP265922 BC cells treated with CM from CAF265922 previously activated by co-culturing with XP265922. This effect was abolished by treatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor or CCL2 neutralizing antibody, and also by using CM from CAF265922 previously co-cultured with XP265922 cells but in the presence of a STAT3 inhibitor (Fig. 4G). We therefore concluded that in BC cells, CCL2 induces NOTCH1 expression and its downstream signaling mainly through p38-dependent activation of the NOTCH1 promoter. In BT474 and MDA361 BC cells, CCL2-induced mammosphere formation was efficiently blocked by inhibitors of the \u03b1- and \u03b3-secretases and p38 MAPK, and by RNA interference (RNAi) of NOTCH1 (Fig. 4H), indicating that activation of NOTCH1 mediates the effect of CCL2 on CSCs.Fibroblast-specific knockdown of CCL2 or CCL2 depletion by a neutralizing antibody inhibits in vivo tumorigenesisTo obtain in vivo evidence of the CSC-regulating function of fibroblast-derived CCL2, we established an orthotopic xenograft model of co-transplanted primary CAFs and BC cells. CAF265922 were stably transduced to express doxycycline (Dox)-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) of CCL2, which suppressed CCL2 expression in vitro by ~60% in the presence of Dox (Fig. 5A). The modified CAFs were then co-transplanted with BC cells from the same primary tumor (XP265922) into the mammary fat pads of female NOD/SCID/IL2R\u03b3-null (NSG) mice. Mammary tumor formation was monitored in transplanted mice with or without Dox treatment. Fibroblast-specific knockdown of CCL2 in the Dox+ group resulted in significantly delayed tumor formation and reduced tumor volume, compared to the Dox\u2212 control group (Fig. 5B and 5C). Xenograft tumors from both groups were harvested, and the fibroblast (labeled by lentiviral-encoded GFP) and tumor cell (positive for human ESA) components were separated for gene expression analyses. In Dox+ tumors, both fibroblast-derived CCL2 expression and tumor cell-derived NOTCH1 expression were significantly lower than their counterparts in Dox\u2212 tumors (Fig. 5D). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining also indicated lower levels of CCL2 and NOTCH1 proteins in the Dox+ tumors, compared to the Dox\u2212 tumors (Fig. 5E). We further analyzed the CSC population within all tumor cells in each xenograft tumor using ALDEFLUOR flow cytometry analysis. The ALDEFLUORbright CSC populations in Dox+ tumors were significantly smaller than those in Dox\u2212 tumors (Fig. 5F; ~0.45% vs. ~1.3%), indicating a decrease in the number of CSCs. Thus, fibroblast-derived CCL2 secretion appears to play an important role in tumorigenesis and in regulating NOTCH1 expression and the CSC population in BC cells. Consistent with these results, the CCL2 neutralizing antibody, but not a control IgG or PBS, significantly suppressed tumorigenesis and decreased NOTCH1 expression in tumor cells when XP265922 and GFP-labeled CAF265922 were co-transplanted into NSG mice (Fig. 5G, 5H and S8). Thus, based on the studies that have been described to this point, we propose a model of CSC generation that incorporates a crosstalk circuit involving STAT3, CCL2 and NOTCH pathways (Figure 5I).Expression of CCL2 and NOTCH1 are correlated in primary BCs and associated with poor differentiation of tumor cellsTo extend our findings to a larger number of primary BCs, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence internal (CI) were calculated using unconditional logistic regression to determine if the microarray-determined expression levels of CCL2, CCR2 and NOTCH family of receptors and ligands in a previously reported BC dataset were associated with tumor grade (Table 1). Patients with Grade 3 (poorly-differentiated) and Grade 1 (well-differentiated) tumors were included in the analysis. We didn\u2019t include the Grade 2 tumors because they fell between Grade 1 and Grade 3 and exhibited highly diverse levels of differentiation, compared to Grades 1 and 3. Patients with poor differentiation (Grade 3) were significantly associated with higher levels of CCL2 (OR = 13.72, 95% CI = 2.66\u201370.89), NOTCH1 (OR = 9.56, 95% CI = 1.54\u201359.27) and delta-like 3 (OR = 20.93, 95% CI = 1.53\u2013289.94), as well as lower level of jagged 1 (OR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.03\u20130.57).In addition, correlation coefficients were calculated between microarray-determined CCL2 and NOTCH1 expression and stratified by tumor grade and stage (Table 2, top part). A significant linear correlation was observed between CCL2 and NOTCH1 expression among all BCs (R = 0.18, p < 0.01). This association was especially pronounced in Grade 3 tumors (R = 0.19, p = 0.03), and in Stage 1 (R = 0.33, p < 0.01) and Stage 2a disease (R = 0.19, p = 0.02). We further evaluated the expression of CCL2 and NOTCH1 at the protein level by IHC in 51 HER2+ or triple-negative primary BCs. The correlation between two proteins was approaching statistical significance (R = 0.26, p = 0.06) among all tumors, and was indeed significant within HER2+ tumors (R = 0.40, p = 0.03), but not triple-negative BCs (Table 2, bottom part). Although the previously reported association of CCL2 with poor clinical outcome was not detected in the current cohort, our results nevertheless support a relationship between CCL2 and NOTCH1 with effects on CSCs in primary BCs.DiscussionFibroblasts are altered by cancer cells through non-genetic modifications, and in turn, effect direct changes on cancer cells or indirect changes on the tumor microenvironment to facilitate cancer growth and invasion. The resulting co-evolution of cancer and the hosting niche critically influences disease progression. Our attention to the influence of fibroblasts on CSCs, the \u201cseeds\u201d of cancer, showed that, upon cancer-mediated activation, human mammary fibroblasts secreted CCL2 to induce CSC generation through activation of NOTCH signaling. In the cancer niche, CCL2 may be produced and secreted into the extracellular environment by almost all cell types, including cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts, tumor-infiltrated monocytes, and endothelial cells. Nevertheless, our study indicated that: 1) CCL2 expression was 4 to 9-fold higher in activated CAFs than in BC cells (Fig. 1D); 2) fibroblast-specific knockdown of CCL2 significantly suppressed tumorigenesis and the CSC population in xenograft tumors (Fig. 5A-F); and 3) CCL2 is detected by IHC in both tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts in primary BC (Fig. S9). These data strongly suggest that CAFs are an important source of CCL2 in the cancer niche and a major environmental regulator of CSCs.The CAF populations in tumor-associated stroma are known to include both fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are endowed with the ability to promote tumor growth and associated with higher-grade malignancy and poor prognosis in cancer patients. These cells express \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) to be distinguished from fibroblasts. Kojima et al. recently show that through self-sustaining autocrine signaling of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), fibroblasts can transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts during tumor progression. The CAFs prepared and examined in our study indeed contained a subpopulation of SMA-expressing myofibroblasts, as indicated by immunofluorescent assay and immunohistochemistry (Fig. S1B and S8). However, the SMA+ myofibroblasts and SMA\u2212 fibroblasts produced CCL2 at comparable levels in the cancer niche (Fig. S8), suggesting that the increased CCL2 production and enhanced CSC-promoting capacity of the herein examined CAFs are unlikely related to the myofibroblast phenotype, but rather a general alteration in fibroblasts in response to cancer-derived stimulation. Our findings also support further studies on the regulation of CSCs and their non-cancerous counterparts by other physiological and therapeutic conditions that locally elevate CCL2 levels. Such conditions, including wound healing, inflammation, and chemotherapy, are becoming increasingly appreciated for their relevance to the biology of normal and cancerous stem cells.Our data indicate that the CCL2-producing and CSC-promoting ability of CAFs is conferred by BC-secreted soluble factors present in the CM, such as the cytokines listed in Fig. 3D. Although different BC cells appeared to secrete distinct sets of cytokines to induce CCL2 production in CAFs, these cytokines ultimately functioned through STAT3, and inhibition of STAT3 completely abrogated the induction of CCL2 by BC paracrine signaling (Fig. 3). Therefore, compared to the diverse signals released by cancer cells, the common effector STAT3 serves as a superior target to therapeutically block cancer-induced activation of stromal fibroblasts. STAT3 has been identified as an important effector and target in cancer cells and tumor-infiltrated immune cells. Our study now identifies STAT3-mediated fibroblast activation as a potential therapeutic target, further supporting the idea that anti-STAT3 therapies may exert dual effects on both cancer and host cells, halting their dynamic and mutual activation during cancer progression.CCL2 has been implicated in breast cancer progression and metastasis. In primary breast tumors, CCL2 expression is correlated with the accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages, and is a significant indicator of early relapse. Overexpression of CCL2 in BC cells promotes metastasis formation in lungs and bone through increasing macrophage infiltration and osteoclast differentiation, respectively. A recent report demonstrates that CCL2 produced by both tumor and stromal cells recruits the CCR2-expressing inflammatory monocytes to the pulmonary metastases of mammary tumors, where monocyte-derived factors promote endothelial permeability and extravasation of tumor cells. CCL2 expression is interactively regulated in the crosstalk between tumor and niche cells. Increased expression of CCL2 is detected in the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) following stimulation by leukemia cells, resulting in enhanced cancer-promoting capacity of MSCs. Co-culture with MSCs, in turn, induces CCL2 expression in cancer cells. These previous studies have therefore established an important role of CCL2 in cancer-host crosstalk through the regulation of tumor cell homing and metastasis, angiogenesis and the immune system.Here we show that CCL2 induces CSCs both in vitro and in vivo through activation of NOTCH (Fig. 4\u20135). NOTCH activation has been shown to promote the self-renewal of mammary stem cells. An important role for NOTCH signaling in human cancers has been long established, and several \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are currently in early clinical development as potential NOTCH-targeting therapeutics. It is proposed that single-agent GSI therapy may be effective in triple-negative BCs, which are known to harbor CSC-like characteristics. Here, our data further support the use of NOTCH-targeting agents in efficiently blocking the stimulatory effect of stromal fibroblasts on CSCs. Our data also indicate that activation of p38 MAPK is required for CCL2-induced NOTCH1 expression (Fig. 4). The E2A-encoded transcription factors E12 and E47 have been shown to activate NOTCH1 expression through binding to multiple E-box sites in the 6-kb NOTCH1 promoter region. Phosphorylation of E47 by p38 MAPK and by MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2), a kinase activated by p38, has been reported. The function of p38-mediated E47 phosphorylation in regulating NOTCH1 promoter activity is still unclear, and may underlie the induction of NOTCH1 by CCL2, which induces potent p38 activation in primary BC cells (Fig. 4D). In addition, the NOTCH-activating effect of CCL2 was only subtle in the ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212MCF7 cells (Fig. 4A and 4B), which also failed to respond to CCL2-induced sphere formation (Fig. 1E). Whether the lower CCR2 level in MCF7 (Fig. S5) causes their low sensitivity to CCL2 effect, and whether levels of CCL2 receptors are associated with BC subtypes need to be further investigated. Nevertheless, IHC staining of primary BCs indicated a significant correlation between CCL2 and NOTCH1 in HER2+ tumors (Table 2, bottom part), suggesting that at least in these tumors, as observed in the HER2+ BT474 and MDA361 BC cells, the regulation of NOTCH signaling by CCL2 may indeed occur in vivo.In summary, our study provides a model in which paracrine signaling initiated by BC cells induces CCL2 production by stromal fibroblasts through STAT3 activation. The fibroblast-derived CCL2, in turn, promotes cancer progression by regulating CSCs through NOTCH activation (Fig. 5I). The results described herein provide novel insights into understanding how CSCs are influenced by the tumor microenvironment during the co-evolution of cancer and the hosting niche, and identify CCL2, STAT3 and NOTCH1 as future therapeutic targets to efficiently block the CSC-stimulating cancer\u2013host crosstalk to overcome CSC-mediated disease progression and treatment resistance.Supplementary

        "content": "Tumor metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have tropism towards tumor tissues, and can be converted into tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cells (TA-MSCs) to facilitate TNBC metastasis through interactions with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and unclear, and effective strategies to suppress tumor metastasis via eliminating TA-MSCs are still lacking. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1) was overexpressed in TA-MSCs, which prompts TA-MSCs to secrete multiple C-C motif chemokine ligands, promoting C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)<sup+</sup TAM recruitment and facilitating TAM polarization into the M2 phenotype, thereby promoting TNBC pulmonary metastasis. Z-GP-DAVLBH, an FAP\u03b1-activated vinblastine prodrug, induces FAP\u03b1<sup+</sup TA-MSC apoptosis, which significantly suppresses CCR2<sup+</sup TAM recruitment and polarization, thus inhibiting pulmonary metastasis of orthotopic TNBC cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenografts. This study provides insight into an important role of FAP\u03b1 in mediating TA-MSC-induced TNBC metastasis and provides compelling evidence that targeting TA-MSCs with an FAP\u03b1-activated prodrug is a promising strategy for suppressing TNBC metastasis.",

Recent gene expression profiling studies have shown that this heterogeneous disease is composed of five major biological subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, and normal breast-like. The majority of basal-like breast cancers exhibit a triple-negative phenotype (ER\u03b1\u2212, progesterone receptor-negative (PR\u2212), Her2-neu-negative) and high frequency of p53 mutations. Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive histological subtype with poor prognosis and high rates of relapse following chemotherapy as compared to other subtypes. Nevertheless, studies of neoadjuvent chemotherapy suggest that women with TNBC who have a pathological complete response to treatment achieve excellent outcome (Carey LA 2007, Liedtke C 2008). Unfortunately, disease recurrence is very frequent, and conventional treatments for relapsed patients are limited. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for the development of novel generation of drugs with high efficiency and specificity against this particular group of patients.ER\u03b1 is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which plays major roles in breast carcinogenesis. Indeed, ER\u03b1 signaling pathway is one of the most important pathways in hormone-dependent breast cancer. The amplification of the ER\u03b1 coding gene ESR1 is frequent in various breast tumors as well as in benign and precancerous breast diseases, suggesting that ESR1 amplification may be a common mechanism in proliferative breast disease and a very early genetic alteration in a large subset of breast cancers. Thereby, it\u2019s reasonable to consider ER\u03b1 inhibitors of significant clinical interest.Several dietary phytochemicals have shown promising anti-cancer properties, and have been used as therapeutic agents against various illnesses for centuries. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the major active component of the spice turmeric, has been widely used in traditional medicines for thousands of years. Several in vitro and in vivo studies as well as clinical trials have shown that curcumin has potent anti-cancer effects, and safe even at high doses. However, curcumin exhibits poor aqueous solubility and low absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, which limits its clinical use. To bypass this limitation, several curcumin analogues were synthesized, with the hope to increase the efficacy while preserving the same safety profile. PAC (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)-N-methyl-4-piperidone) is a promising anti-cancer curcumin analogue. Indeed, PAC is 5 times more efficient than curcumin in inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In the present study we have shown that PAC is more stable than curcumin in PBS and in circulating blood. Furthermore, PAC-dependent cytotoxicity is more potent on ER\u03b1\u2212 cells than ER\u03b1+ cells through down-regulation of ER\u03b1. Moreover, PAC inhibits the pro-metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in breast cancer cells, with higher efficiency on the TNBC subtype. Additionally, PAC suppressed the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of breast cancer cells on breast stromal fibroblasts via suppressing the secretion of two important cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1.MethodsEthics statementAnimal experiments were approved by the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) under the RAC proposal # 2080009, and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Animals suffered only needle injection pain and also certain degree of pain/distress related to the growth/ burden of the tumor. The euthanasia was performed using cervical dislocation.Cells and cell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured following the instructions of the company. NBF-1 are primary normal breast fibroblasts developed from tissues obtained from plastic surgery, and cultured as previously described. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA) except for antibiotic and antimycotic solutions, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA).Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblottingThis has been performed as previously described. Antibodies directed against Vimentin (RV202), Twist1, N-cadherin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); Akt, phospho-Akt (193H12), Erk1/2, phospho-Erk1/2 (THR202/TYR204), E-cadherin (24E10) and MCP-1 from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); c-Myc from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA); Cyclin D1 (HD11), ER\u03b1 (F-10) and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, FL-335), were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).RNA purification and quantitative RT-PCRGAPDH: 5\u2019-GAGTCCACTGGCGTCTTC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GGGGTGCTAAGCAGTTGGT-3\u2019;CCND1: 5\u2019 -TGTTCGTGGCCTCTAAGATGAAG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019- AGGTTCCACTTGAGCTTGTTCAC-3\u2019c-MYC: 5\u2019- CTTCTCTCCGTCCTCGGATTCT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-GAAGGTGATCCAGACTCTGACCTT-3\u2019Total RNA was purified using the TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and was treated with RNase-free DNase before cDNA synthesis using the Advantage RT Kit (Clontech). For quantitative RT-PCR, the RT2 Real-Time\u2122 SYBR Green qPCR mastermix (Qiagen, UK) was used and the amplifications were performed utilizing the Bio-Rad iQ5 multicolor Real time PCR detection system. The melting-curve data were collected to check PCR specificity, and the amount of PCR products was measured by threshold cycle (Ct) values and the relative ratio of specific genes to GAPDH for each sample was then calculated. The respective primers are:TransfectionThe pGFP-C-shLenti plasmid bearing ESR1-shRNA or scrambled shRNA (Origene), were used at 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml each for transfection of 293FT cells. Lentiviral supernatants were collected 48\u00a0h post-transfection. Culture media were removed from the target cells and replaced with the lentiviral supernatant and incubated for 24\u00a0h in the presence of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Transduced cells were selected after 48\u00a0h with puromycin (Invitrogen).Bioavailability of PAC and curcuminFor the bioavailability experiments, normal Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u20093\u00d75, 25\u00a0g, 3 mice/time point) were intraperitoneally injected with PAC or curcumin (100\u00a0mg/Kg). 400\u00a0\u03bcL blood samples were withdrawn directly from the heart of each mouse into a heparin-rinsed vial at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120\u00a0min post-injection. Each blood sample was centrifuged at 3000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u00a0min. The resulting plasma sample (100\u00a0\u03bcL) was acidified using hydrochloric acid (HCl 6\u00a0N, 10\u00a0\u03bcL) followed by three times extraction with a mixture of ethyl acetate:propanol (9:1, 1\u00a0mL). The extract was then completely dried and re-dissolved in methanol (100\u00a0\u03bcL) before direct injection onto HPLC for analysis. Using a standard curve of PAC and curcumin, the data obtained from analyzed samples were utilized to construct pharmacokinetic curve of PAC/curcumin concentrations in plasma using the Graph Pad Prism software. Separate experiments using the same extraction system were carried out to determine extraction efficiency of PAC and curcumin from plasma and showed a yield of 96\u00a0%.HPLC analysesReversed-phase HPLC were performed on Jasco, HPLC systems using C18 column (10\u00a0\u03bcm, 4.6 \u00d7 250\u00a0mm) (Econosil, Alltech, USA). HPLC was run using a gradient of 0.1\u00a0% TFA in water (solvent A) and 0.1\u00a0% TFA in CH3CN (solvent B) gradient, 0 to 50\u00a0% B, 15\u00a0min, 50 to 50\u00a0% B, 5\u00a0min, 50 to 0\u00a0% B, 5\u00a0min, and 100 to 100\u00a0% A, 5\u00a0min each at flow rate of 1\u00a0mL/min. The HPLC systems are equipped with a UV detector set at 420\u00a0nm, a Flow-count \u03b3-radioactivity detection system (Bioscan, USA) and Lauralite analysis program (LabLogic, UK).Cell migration, invasion and proliferationThese assays were performed as described in detail previously. Cell migration, invasion and proliferation were assessed in a real-time, non-invasive, and label-free manner using the xCELLigence RTCA technology (Roche). Migration and invasion were assessed as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the CIM-plate 16. Briefly, initially 160\u00a0\u03bcl of cell-free complete media, or SFM were added to the lower chamber wells and 30\u00a0\u03bcl of SFM to the upper chamber wells and plates were incubated for 1\u00a0h in the cell incubator to obtain equilibrium. Subsequently, the background signal was measured and exponentially growing cells resuspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of SFM were seeded in the upper chamber wells with a thin layer of matrigel basement membrane (invasion) or without (migration). Cells were seeded at 1\u20133 \u00d7 104 cells/well. After cell addition CIM-plates 16 were incubated for 30\u00a0min at room temperature in the laminar flow. Subsequently, the plates were locked in the RTCA DP device in the incubator. Each condition was performed in triplicate.For proliferation assays, exponentially growing cells in complete media (0.5\u20131 \u00d7 104/well) were seeded in E-plates as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The rest of the procedure was the same as for the invasion and migration assays. Relative cell migration, invasion and proliferation levels are shown in arbitrary units.Apoptosis analysis by annexin V/flow cytometryCells were either not treated or challenged with PAC or curcumin, and then harvested, centrifuged and stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Alexa Flour 488 annexin V (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) as previously described.Protein arraysSFCM were applied to RayBio the human cytokine array 5 (AAH-CYT-5, RayBiotech, Inc (Norcross, GA, USA) as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Signal densities were assessed with the ImageJ software, and data analysis was carried out following the Array protocol\u2019s instructions.Tumor xenograftsBreast cancer xenografts were created in nude mice by subcutaneous injection of MDA-MB-231 cells, and then the animals were treated with PAC (100\u00a0mg/Kg) or DMSO as previously described.Statistical analysisStudent\u2019s t-test was used for statistical analysis and p values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered as statistically significant.Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in medium without serum for 24\u00a0h, and then media were collected and briefly centrifuged, and cells were counted. The resulting supernatants (SFCM) were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until needed. SFCM were diluted, when necessary, based on the cell counts.ResultsPAC is more stable than curcumin in PBS and circulating bloodPAC is more stable than curcumin. a Curcumin and PAC structures. Both molecules were incubated in phosphate buffer (0.1\u00a0M, pH\u00a07.4) for different periods of time, and then were analyzed by HPLC. The arrows indicate the peaks corresponding to the intact PAC and curcumin molecules. b Histogram showing the proportion of the remaining molecules. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD from three different experiments, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01. c Balb/c mice were intraperitonealy injected with PAC and curcumin (100\u00a0mg/Kg). Blood samples were withdrawn directly from the heart of each mouse at the indicated periods of time. The resulting plasma extracts were dried and re-dissolved in methanol before injection onto HPLC for analysis. The error bars represent means +/- SDTo compare the stability of curcumin with that of PAC, we have first studied the stability of both molecules in phosphate buffer (0.1\u00a0M, pH\u00a07.4). PAC and curcumin were incubated in PBS for different periods of time (0, 5, 30\u00a0min), and then were analyzed by HPLC. Both PAC and curcumin were instable in PBS at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, but PAC showed higher stability (Fig.\u00a01a). Indeed, after 30\u00a0min of incubation more than 90\u00a0% of curcumin was decomposed, while only 60\u00a0% of PAC was decomposed (Fig.\u00a01b). This indicates that after 30\u00a0min of incubation PAC was 4 times more stable than curcumin in PBS.In order to test the bioavailability of curcumin and PAC in animals, normal Balb/c mice (n\u2009=\u200930) were intraperitonealy injected with PAC or curcumin (100\u00a0mg/Kg). 400\u00a0\u03bcL blood samples were withdrawn directly from the heart of each mouse at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120\u00a0min post-injection. The resulting plasma extracts were completely dried and re-dissolved in methanol (100\u00a0\u03bcL) before injection onto HPLC for analysis. Figure\u00a01c shows that the amount of PAC presents in plasma at 15\u00a0min post-injection reached 35\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, while the level of curcumin was only 10.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The level of PAC further increased in blood reaching its maximum level (40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) 45\u00a0min post-injection, and dropped to 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL at 60\u00a0min post-injection, then remained relatively constant during the following 60\u00a0min (Fig.\u00a01c). On the other hand, the level of curcumin decreased in a time-dependent manner reaching a level as low as 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL 120\u00a0min post-injection. This shows that 25\u00a0% of the injected PAC was still in blood 2\u00a0h post-injection, and that PAC is 30 times more stable than curcumin in circulating blood.PAC induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells with higher efficiency on basal-like cellsPAC triggers apoptosis more efficiently in ER\u03b1-negative than in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells. Cells were either sham-treated or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 72\u00a0h, and then cell death was assessed by annexin V/PI in association with flow cytometry. a Charts. b Histogram showing the proportion of cell death (apoptosis\u2009+\u2009necrosis) in each cell line. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD from three different experiments, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05To measure the extent and the nature of cell death induced by PAC on various breast cancer cell lines, the fluorochrome-conjugated annexin V/PI stain test was used and cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer. Different cell lines were used including basal-like, ER\u03b1\u2212 (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, and BT-549), luminal, ER\u03b1+ (MCF-7, T-47D and BT-474), and HER2-enriched, ER\u03b1\u2212 (SK-BR-3). Sub-confluent cells were treated either with DMSO (used as control) or with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 72\u00a0h. Figure\u00a02a shows the presence of four different cell populations after the double staining annexin V/PI and sorting by flow cytometry: live cells (normal) (annexin V-/PI-), early apoptotic cells (Apo) (annexin V+/PI-), late apoptotic cells (Late apo) (annexin V+/PI+) and necrotic cells (Necrotic) (annexin V-/PI+). Importantly, PAC induced cell death mainly by apoptosis in all breast cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02a).Figure\u00a02b presents cell death of different cell lines after treatment with PAC as percentages relative to DMSO-treated cells. The real effect of PAC was obtained by discarding the proportion of dead cells obtained in the control samples from the treated ones for each cell line. In addition, the proportion of total cell death was considered as the sum of necrosis and both early and late apoptosis. 80\u201390\u00a0% of basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, and BT-549) and about 65\u00a0% of HER2-enriched cells (SK-BR-3) underwent cell death in response to PAC (Fig.\u00a02b). While in luminal cells, only 45\u00a0% of MCF-7 cells and 25\u00a0% of T-47D cells died upon PAC treatment (Fig.\u00a02b). This indicates that PAC is cytotoxic against various types of breast cancer cells, and its effect is more potent on the ER\u03b1\u2212 subtype.Specific ER\u03b1 down-regulation sensitizes breast cancer cells to PACER\u03b1 down-regulation potentiates the pro-apoptotic effect of PAC. MCF-7 cells were transfected with vectors containing 3 different ESR1-shRNA sequences (1, 2, 3) or a scrambled sequence (Scbl). a Cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. b Cells were treated with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and the proportion of apoptotic cells was determined using annexinV/PI-Flow cytometry. c Histogram, Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from three different experiments, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.005To explore the role of ER\u03b1 in PAC-dependent induction of apoptosis, we knocked-down the ESR1 gene in MCF-7 cells using specific ESR1-shRNA, and a scrambled sequence was used as control. Figure\u00a03a shows strong ER\u03b1 down-regulation by the ESR1-shRNA1, while ESR1-shRNA2 and ESR1-shRNA3 had only marginal effects. Similar effect was observed on the ER\u03b1 target c-Myc (Fig.\u00a03a). Subsequently, these cells were either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 3\u00a0days, and then cell death was assessed by AnnexinV/PI as described above. Figure\u00a03b and c shows that while PAC triggered apoptosis in only about 35\u00a0% of cells bearing control-shRNA, ESR1-shRNA2 or ESR1-shRNA3, the proportion of apoptotic cells reached 70\u00a0% in MCF-7 cells expressing ESR1-shRNA1. This shows that ER\u03b1 down-regulation plays a major role in PAC-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells.PAC down-regulates ER\u03b1, c-Myc and cyclin D1PAC down-regulates ER\u03b1 and its targets C-Myc and cyclin D1. a Cells were challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for the indicated periods of time, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis utilizing specific antibodies against the indicated proteins. b Cells were either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, and then total RNA was extracted and used for qRT-PCR using specific primers for the indicated genes. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from three different experiments, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. c Nude mice bearing sub-cutaneous humanized tumor xenografts were treated with DMSO or PAC, and then cell lysates were prepared from excised tumors and used form immunoblotting utilizing specific antibodies against the indicated proteinsWe then set out to test the effect of PAC on the expression of ER\u03b1 in both types of cells (ER\u03b1 -positive and \u2013negative). To this end, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were exposed to PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and were harvested after different periods of time (0, 8, 24, 48, 72\u00a0h). Cell lysates were prepared and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis using specific anti- ER\u03b1 antibody, and GAPDH was utilized as internal control. The level of ER\u03b1 decreased in both cell lines, but became undetectable after 24\u00a0h of treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells, while a significant amount of the protein was still present in MCF-7 cells even after 72\u00a0h of treatment (Fig.\u00a04a). The ER\u03b1 protein is a well-known positive regulator of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, two important apoptosis modulators in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated the effect of PAC on the expression of these two proteins. Figure\u00a04a shows that the levels of both proteins started to decrease after 24\u00a0h of treatment and continue to decline in a time-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231. On the other hand, the effect of PAC on cyclin D1 and c-Myc was only marginal in MCF-7 cells (Fig.\u00a04a). To confirm this finding, we tested the effect of PAC on CCND1 and c-MYC mRNAs. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h and total RNA was purified and used for amplification by quantitative RT-PCR using specific primers. Figure\u00a04b shows that while PAC strongly down-regulated both genes in MDA-MB-231 cells, it increased the level of c-MYC and had only marginal effect on cyclin D1 in MCF-7 cells. This confirms the strong effect of PAC on ER\u03b1 in ER\u03b1\u2212 breast cancer cells and indicates that this gene as well as its targets c-MYC and CCND1 might play important roles in the response of these cells to PAC. To further validate these findings we tested the effect of PAC on these three genes in tumor xenografts formed subcutaneously in nude mice upon injection of MDA-MB-231. The immunoblotting shows PAC-dependent down-regulation of the 3 genes in xenogratft tissues isolated from PAC-treated animals as compared to control animals treated with DMSO (Fig.\u00a04c).PAC suppresses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process both in vitro and in vivoPAC suppresses EMT in breast cancer cells and tumor xenografts. a Cells were seeded in E-16 plates for 24\u00a0h, and then were either sham-treated (DMSO) or exposed to PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for the indicated periods of time. Cell proliferation was monitored in real time using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. b Cells were exposed to DMSO or PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, and then were seeded in the CIM-plate with SFM in the upper wells separated by 8 micron pore size PET membrane with thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (invasion) or without (migration). The lower chambers contained complete media as chemoattractant. Cells were incubated in normal culture conditions for 24\u00a0h and the migration/invasion were determined using the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from 3 different experiments; *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001. c Cells were either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for Immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. d Figure legends as in Fig.\u00a04c\nSince estrogen receptor signaling plays a role in the pro-metastatic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, we sought to investigate the effect of PAC on EMT in both ER\u03b1+and ER\u03b1\u2212 cells. To this end, MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM), and then cell proliferation was assessed using the xCELLigence RTCA technology utilizing the E-plates. Figure\u00a05a shows strong PAC-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation of both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, with a more pronounced effect on the ER\u03b1\u2212 cells.Next, we investigated the effect of PAC on the migration/invasion abilities using the xCELLigence RTCA technology utilizing CIM-plate 16. Figure\u00a05b shows that PAC inhibits the migration and the invasion capabilities of both cell lines, with an effect more pronounced on the ER\u03b1\u2212 MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to the ER\u03b1+ MCF-7 cells.To elucidate the molecular basis of this decrease in the migration/invasion abilities, we tested the effect of PAC on the pro-invasive/migratory protein kinases ERK1/2 and AKT. Therefore, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were either sham-treated or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, and then cell lysates were prepared and total levels as well as the phosphorylated/active forms of these two proteins were assessed by immunoblotting. Figure\u00a05c shows strong PAC-dependent inhibition of both protein kinases AKT and ERK1/2 in both cell lines, with a higher effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. Indeed, the inhibition of ERK1/2 was very strong in the TNBC cells (Fig.\u00a05b). Since the activation of these two protein kinases is part of EMT, we investigated the possible PAC-dependent inhibition of this pro-metastatic process, through testing the effect on the expression of specific mesenchymal and epithelial markers by immunoblotting. Figure\u00a05c shows clear PAC-dependent up-regulation of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells, while the levels of all tested mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin and Twist-1) were reduced in both cell lines, but the effect was more pronounced in MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, similar results were obtained in vivo on tumor xenografts upon sub-cutaneous injection of MDA-MB231 cells in nude mice followed by intraperitoneal treatment with PAC (100\u00a0mg/Kg) (Fig.\u00a05d). Indeed, PAC inhibited the two important protein kinases AKT and ERK1/2 and also up-regulated E-cadherin, while it down-regulated the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin and twist1 (Fig.\u00a05d). Together, these results indicate that PAC suppresses the EMT process in breast cancer cells both ER\u03b1 -positive and -negative, with a more potent effect on ER\u03b1- cells.PAC inhibits the expression/secretion of the pro-metastatic MCP-1 and IL-6 cytokinesPAC inhibits the expression/secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1. SFCM from MDA-MB-231 cells either sham treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h were collected and applied onto Human Cytokine Antibody Array membrane. a Blots, the rectangles indicate the spots corresponding to IL-6 and MCP-1, while the arrows indicate differentially expressed cytokines. b Histogram showing secretion levels of the indicated cytokines upon quantification. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D, *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. c Cells were exposed to DMSO or PAC, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies against the indicated proteinsHuman cytokine antibody arrays were used to detect the differentially expressed cytokines in the conditioned media obtained from MDA-MB-231 cells either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM). This experiment showed the differential expression of several cykokines, including IL-6, MCP-1, IL-5 and angiogenin (Fig.\u00a06a and b). The effect on IL-6 and MCP-1 is of great importance since these two cytokines play important roles in the spread of various types of cancer, including breast carcinomas. Therefore, we tested the effect of PAC on the expression of these two cytokines at the protein level. The immunoblotting analysis shows strong PAC-dependent down-regulation of both IL-6 and MCP-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a06c).PAC suppresses the paracrine effects of breast cancer cells on breast stromal fibroblastsPAC suppresses the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of breast cancer cells. SFCM from MDA-MB-231 cells either exposed to DMSO (DMSO-MDA-SFCM) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) (PAC-MDA-SFCM) was used for indirect co-culturing of NBF-1 fibroblasts cells for 24\u00a0h, and then cell proliferation (a) as well as migration/invasion (b) were assessed using the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System as described in Fig.\u00a04. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D from three different experiments; *, P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001After showing PAC-dependent inhibition of IL-6/MCP-1 expression and secretion from breast cancer cells we sought to test the effect of PAC on the paracrine effects of these cells on breast stromal fibroblasts. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were first either sham-treated (DMSO) or challenged with PAC (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h. Subsequently, cells were cultured in serum-free medium (SFM) for 24\u00a0h, and then serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) were collected and utilized to challenge normal breast stromal fibroblast cells NBF-1 for 24\u00a0h. Proliferation, migration and invasion of stromal fibroblasts were assessed with the xCELLigence RTCA technology. Figure\u00a07a shows PAC-dependent inhibition of the paracrine effects of MDA-MB-231 cells on the proliferation rate of fibroblast cells. Similarly, media conditioned with PAC-treated MDA-MB-231 cells strongly suppressed the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a07b). Together, these results indicate that PAC inhibits the pro-metastatic effects of the highly invasive breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231.DiscussionTriple-negative breast cancers are poorly differentiated, highly malignant and have a poor outcome. Duration of response is usually short, with rapid relapse very common and median survival of advanced disease of just 13\u00a0months, which is much less than the median duration of survival observed in other advanced subtypes. This made TNBC one of the most attractive areas of research in oncology.We have shown here that the newly synthesized curcumin analogue PAC is 4 times more stable than curcumin in PBS and 30 times more stable than curcumin in circulating blood in mice (Fig.\u00a01). This higher bioavailability of PAC is of great importance since the low bioavailability of curcumin limits its potential use in the clinic. Additionally, we present strong evidence that PAC is a potent anti-breast cancer agent with the strongest effects on the TNBC subtype cells. Indeed, PAC exhibited higher cytotoxicity against different TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, BT-20 and BT-549) than luminal cells (MCF-7 and T-47D). Likewise, PAC inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells with higher effect on ER\u03b1\u2212cells than on ER\u03b1+ cells. Interestingly, when ER\u03b1 was down-regulated in MCF-7 cells with specific shRNA, the pro-apoptotic effect of PAC was doubled. This clearly showed that high expression of ER\u03b1 limited PAC cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells, and we hypothesized that PAC-dependent apoptosis could be mediated through ER\u03b1 down-regulation. Therefore, we tested the effect of PAC on the expression of ER\u03b1 in cells that express high and low level of this receptor, and have shown that PAC reduced ER\u03b1 level in both types of cells, but in the ER\u03b1\u2212 cells ER\u03b1 became undetectable, while its level was still high in ER\u03b1+ cells despite its diminution. This provided a meaningful explanation to the higher effect of PAC on ER\u03b1\u2212cells, and corroborated the result obtained by specific down-regulation of ER\u03b1 in cells that express this receptor. This also confirmed our previous results showing that expression of the receptor coding gene ESR1 in ER\u03b1\u2212 breast cancer cells increased their resistance to PAC. Together, these results indicate that PAC-related induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells depends on the cellular level of ER\u03b1. In fact, various laboratory studies demonstrated that reduced estrogen levels induced apoptosis. A cyclopentenone derivative (CTC-35) was also shown to have potent proapoptotic activity in ER\u03b1\u2212 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, green tea EGCG decreased the proliferation rates of breast cancer cells through strong down-regulation of ER\u03b1.PAC-dependent down-regulation of ER\u03b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells was accompanied with a strong decrease in the level of ER\u03b1 main targets c-Myc and cyclin D1, both in vitro and in vivo. However, c-Myc and cyclin D1 were not down-regulated in MCF-7 cells, and the c-MYC mRNA was rather up-regulated after 24\u00a0h of PAC treatment (Fig.\u00a04b). This difference in the c-MYC mRNA and protein levels upon PAC treatment could result from translational of post-translational regulatory process in MCF-7 cells. c-MYC and cyclin D1 are two major oncogenes, which confer proliferative and anti-apoptosis capacities to breast cancer cells, and are associated with altered sensitivity to endocrine therapy. The c-Myc protein plays a major role in the apoptotic response of breast cancer cells. This protein has been found overexpressed in 45\u00a0% breast tumors. Cyclin D1 is an oncogene that is overexpressed in about 50\u00a0% of all breast cancer cases, and its down-regulation is an important target in breast cancer therapy. Therefore, PAC-related targeting of these two oncogenes could be of great therapeutic value.In addition, we have shown that PAC suppresses the EMT process in both ER\u03b1+ and ER\u03b1\u2212 cell lines, with a higher effect on ER\u03b1-negative cells (Fig.\u00a05). EMT is currently considered as pivotal event in the initial step of the metastatic cascade that allows cells to acquire migratory, invasive and stem-like properties. Evolving evidence indicates that ER\u03b1 signaling can directly regulate EMT-related transcriptional factors, indicating that ER\u03b1 might be a key regulator of the EMT program. PAC inhibited the migration/invasion abilities of breast cancer cells through inhibiting the ERK1/2 and AKT protein kinases, and repressed the mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin. Similar effects were also observed in vivo on tumor xenografts, wherein PAC increased the expression of E-cadherin and repressed N-cadherin, vimentin, AKT and Twist1. Similarly, it has been previously shown that curcumin plays an important role in the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced EMT in breast cancer cells through the down-regulation of NF-kB-Snail activity.In addition to their high migratory and invasiveness capacities, ER\u03b1\u2212 cells secrete high amounts of pro-metastatic cytokines such as IL-6 and MCP-1, which can activate stromal cells including fibroblasts. Interestingly, PAC reduced the secreted levels of several cytokines including IL-6 and MCP-1 from MDA-MB-231 cells. This repressed the paracrine pro-replicative and -invasive/migratory effects of these highly invasive cells on breast stromal fibroblasts. This shows the ability of PAC in inhibiting the pro-metastatic capabilities of MDA-MB-231 cells. Indeed, there exists abundant evidence demonstrating that active stromal fibroblasts play major roles in breast cancer progression and spread. These cells escort cancer cells through the whole carcinogenesis process. Therefore, targeting active stromal fibroblasts or blocking their cross-talk with cancer cells is a promising therapeutic approach.ConclusionsWe have shown here that PAC has better bioavailability than curcumin. Moreover, we present clear evidence that PAC down-regulates ER\u03b1 and triggers apoptosis in breast cancer cells with higher efficiency on receptor negative cells. Furthermore, PAC suppressed the prometastatic features of the invasive breast cancer cells by suppressing EMT and the paracrine effect on breast stromal fibroblasts. This makes PAC as a valuable candidate for the future armada against the devastating TNBC type of tumors.AbbreviationsATCC, American type culture collection; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; ER\u03b1, estrogen receptor alfa; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; shRNA, short hairpin RNAReferencesGlobal breast cancer: the lessons to bring homeCancer statistics, 2012Molecular portraits of human breast tumoursDissecting the heterogeneity of triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: disease entity or title of convenience?Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) gene amplification is frequent in breast cancerChemosensitization and radiosensitization of tumors by plant polyphenolsPlants vs. cancer: a review on natural phytochemicals in preventing and treating cancers and their druggabilityRecent developments in delivery, bioavailability, absorption and metabolism of curcumin: the golden pigment from golden spicePAC, a novel curcumin analogue, has anti-breast cancer properties with higher efficiency on ER-negative cellsBreast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their counterparts display neoplastic-specific changesThe p16INK4a tumor suppressor controls p21WAF1 induction in response to ultraviolet lightp16 inhibits the pro-metastatic potentials of osteosarcoma cells through targeting the ERK pathway and TGF-beta1p16(INK4a) positively regulates cyclin D1 and E2F1 through negative control of AUF1MYC and breast cancerIL6-mediated suppression of miR-200c directs constitutive activation of inflammatory signaling circuit driving transformation and tumorigenesisTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceTriple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: molecular features, pathogenesis, treatment and current lines of researchTackling the diversity of triple-negative breast cancerEstrogen regulation of apoptosis: how can one hormone stimulate and inhibit?Induction of apoptosis in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells by natural and synthetic cyclopentenones: role of the IkappaB kinase/nuclear factor-kappaB pathwayIn vitro mechanism for downregulation of ER-alpha expression by epigallocatechin gallate in ER+/PR+ human breast cancer cellsDownstream targets of growth factor and oestrogen signalling and endocrine resistance: the potential roles of c-Myc, cyclin D1 and cyclin ERole of c-myc in tamoxifen-induced apoptosis estrogen-independent breast cancer cellsProtein expression and molecular analysis of c-myc gene in primary breast carcinomas using immunohistochemistry and differential polymerase chain reactionCyclin D1 oncoprotein aberrantly accumulates in malignancies of diverse histogenesisIdentification of cyclin D1- and estrogen-regulated genes contributing to breast carcinogenesis and progressionBreast cancer progression: controversies and consensus in the molecular mechanisms of metastasis and EMTERalpha suppresses slug expression directly by transcriptional repressionERalpha signaling through slug regulates E-cadherin and EMTEstrogen receptor silencing induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer cellsEstrogen receptor alpha mediates epithelial to mesenchymal transition, expression of specific matrix effectors and functional properties of breast cancer cellsCurcumin inhibits LPS-induced EMT through downregulation of NF-kappaB-Snail signaling in breast cancer cellsThe cytokine IL-6 reactivates breast stromal fibroblasts through transcription factor STAT3-dependent Up-regulation of the RNA-binding protein AUF1CCL2 mediates cross-talk between cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts that regulates breast cancer stem cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts are a promising therapeutic targetThe impact of tumor stroma on drug response in breast cancer"

        "content": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease for which prognosis and treatment strategies are largely governed by the receptor status (estrogen, progesterone and Her2) of the tumor cells. Gene expression profiling of whole breast tumors further stratifies breast cancer into several molecular subtypes which also co-segregate with the receptor status of the tumor cells.

Gene expression profiling of whole breast tumors further stratifies breast cancer into several molecular subtypes which also co-segregate with the receptor status of the tumor cells. We postulated that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor stroma may exhibit subtype specific gene expression profiles and thus contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype specific manner.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+. The 18 significantly enriched pathways share 66 unique genes with 61 of those upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC.Q-RT-PCR validation of individual gene expression data in CAFsTo confirm differential gene expression levels in the three breast cancer subtypes, Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC, we selected 6 genes (ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1, FZD1) with significantly different levels of expression based on our microarray studies and validated their expression levels by qRT-PCR. Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion.

Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

Conclusion The current study identified CAF subtypes based on gene expression profiles and found that CAF subtypes have significantly different overall survival, immune cells, and immunotherapy response rates.1. IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

A recent study suggested that in some cancers, CAFs express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which can act as a prognostic marker. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and to identify the most suitable primary antibody for immunostaining for CAF PD-L1. Immunohistochemical staining (primary antibodies of 73-10, SP142, and E1L3N) and tissue microarrays were used to analyse the expression profiles of PD-L1 in CAF in 61 patients with TNBC who underwent surgery. Overall survival (OS) was compared based on CAF PD-L1 expression, and the risk factors for OS were analysed. The relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival was also examined. Thirty-four (55.7%) patients were positive for CAF PD-L1 (73-10) expression. Compared with CAF PD-L1 negativity, there was a significant correlation between CAF PD-L1 positivity and better OS (p\u2009=\u20090.029). CAF PD-L1 expression, evaluated using SP-142 or E1L3N, did not correlate with OS. CAF PD-L1-positivity (73-10) correlated significantly with better prognosis in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio: 0.198; 95% confidence interval: 0.044-0.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035). CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel marker for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC, and the 73-10 assay may be suitable for immunostaining CAF PD-L1.",

CAF PD-L1 expression, evaluated using SP-142 or E1L3N, did not correlate with OS. CAF PD-L1-positivity (73\u201310) correlated significantly with better prognosis in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio: 0.198; 95% confidence interval: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035).ConclusionsCAF PD-L1 expression is a novel marker for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC, and the 73\u201310 assay may be suitable for immunostaining CAF PD-L1.BackgroundBreast cancers usually influence the immune system; however, the level of immune infiltration reportedly differs among breast cancer molecular subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

Beside traditionally considered as an insulating and mechanically supportive site of energy storage, adipose tissue has endocrine functions, capable of regulating systemic energy and metabolic homeostasis through a complex network of signals. The concept that adipose tissue, and more specifically adipocytes, are involved in tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis, is now called \u201cadiponcosis\u201d.Adipocytes surround breast cancer cells and may contribute to the stromal\u2013ductal epithelial cell\u2013cell interactions within the mammary microenvironment. In this regard, obesity has been shown to increase rates of breast cancer in postmenopausal women by 30\u201350%. Studies of mortality and survival illustrate that adiposity is associated with both poorer survival and increased likelihood of recurrence among breast cancer cases, regardless of menopausal status and after adjustment for stage and treatment. Death rate in very obese women (BMI \u2265 40.0) with breast cancer is three times higher than in very lean (BMI < 20.5) women.Moreover, epidemiological studies have also revealed that women with diabetes have a statistically significant 20% increased risk of breast cancer. Additionally, patients with breast cancer and preexisting diabetes have increased risk for distant metastasis and for all-cause mortality compared with their non-diabetic counterparts.Metabolic derangements, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, drive to adipocyte alterations with imbalanced production of adipokines, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, hormones, proangiogenic factors and extracellular matrix constituents. Virtually, all of the adipocyte factors may be envisioned as contributing factors for cancer onset and/or progression. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that adipocytes could promote breast tumor growth. Moreover, glucose and fatty acids modify adipocyte-releasing properties and enhance their ability to induce breast cancer cell proliferation. Nevertheless, how metabolic alterations at the level of the adipose tissue may affect tumor progression is still unclear.Here, we show that adipocytes may integrate inputs from metabolic environment and promote motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. This effect is induced, at least in part, by the CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), also known as RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted), whose abundance in peritumoral adipose tissue correlates with metastasis and with poorer overall survival in women with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).RESULTSAdipocytes promote TNBC cell motilityIn order to investigate adipocyte effect on cancer cell invasiveness, MDA-MB231 triple negative breast cancer cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell, while differentiated human adipocytes were seeded in the lower chamber. Co-culture with adipocytes, in the absence of serum, increased MDA-MB231 invasive capacity through the matrigel filter by 1.7-fold compared to the same cells cultured in the absence of adipocytes (Figure 1A). At variance, co-culture with human Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) cells enhanced by only 1.2-fold MDA-MB231 invasion. The effect of adipocyte factors was similar to the positive control (i.e. cells incubated with 10% FBS medium).Effect of adipocytes and glucose-treated adipocytes on breast cancer cell motility(A) MDA-MB231 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with or without human SVF/adipocytes in the lower chamber in serum free-medium. Cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining as described in Materials and Methods. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells without SVF/adipocytes in the lower chamber, incubated in serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values (**p < 0.01). (B) Human adipocytes were shifted with high glucose medium (25 mM glucose-HG) or with low glucose medium (5.5 mM glucose-LG) for 24 h. Then, they were incubated with MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells incubated in serum-free HG or LG medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (**p < 0.01). #denote statistically significant values of HG over LG (#p < 0.05). (C) Human adipocytes were pre-incubated with HG medium or with LG medium for 24 h. Then, they were further incubated with regular glucose (15 mM) serum-free medium for 8 h. Media were collected (CM) and applied in the lower chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells incubated in regular glucose serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (*p < 0.05). #denote statistically significant values of CM-HG over CM-LG (#p < 0.05). (D) Confluent monolayers of MDA-MB231 were wounded by manually scratching as described in Materials and Methods and incubated with CM collected from human adipocytes pre-incubated with either LG or HG medium for 24 h and further incubated with regular glucose serum-free medium for 8 h. Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by a digital camera coupled to the microscope and percentage of wound distance was calculated with the camera software. The results have been reported as percentage of gap closure at 24 h compared with time 0. A complete gap closure was considered as 100%. *denote statistically significant values over MDA-MB231 cells incubated in regular glucose serum-free medium (*p < 0.05). #denote statistically significant values of CM-HG over CM-LG (#p < 0.05). The pictures are representative of wound gaps at 0 point and upon 24 h of scratch assay. For all the panels in the figure, data in the graphs represent the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent triplicate experiments.Next, we tested whether glucose may change the promoting action of human adipocytes on MDA-MB231 invasiveness. To this end, human differentiated adipocytes, regularly cultured in 15 mM glucose, were shifted for 24 h in either 25 mM glucose (HG), a concentration resembling hyperglycemia in humans, or in 5.5 mM glucose (LG), a concentration representative of normal fasting glucose levels in humans. Then, adipocytes were co-cultured with MDA-MB231 in serum-free HG or LG medium for additional 24 h. As shown in Figure 1B adipocytes significantly increased cancer cell invasiveness and this effect is potentiated in HG (3-fold increase compared to LG). Similar results were obtained also with conditioned media (CM) system. In detail, adipocytes were cultured for 24 h either in HG and in LG. Media were changed and cells were allowed to secrete factors into freshly added serum free medium (15 mM glucose). After 8 h, CM were collected and applied into the lower chamber of a transwell system in presence of MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber on a matrigel-coated filter. As shown, pre-incubation of adipocytes with HG medium enhanced by about 2-fold their ability to induce MDA-MB231 cell invasiveness, compared to control cells (without CM) (Figure 1C). At variance, pre-incubation with LG medium significantly lowered their ability to promote invasiveness of breast cancer cells (Figure 1C).In order to test cell motility, confluent monolayers of MDA-MB231 were wounded longitudinally and incubated with conditioned media derived from adipocytes incubated with HG (HG-CM) or LG (LG-CM) in presence of mitomycin C, an irreversible inhibitor of mitosis. Images were taken at 0 and 24 h after wounding. HG-CM increased motility of breast cancer cells by about 2-fold (Figure 1D). The wound closure was similar to that achieved with 10% FBS medium and significantly higher compared to that observed with LG-CM. Similar results were also obtained with ER-\u03b1 positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 1).Adipocyte-released CCL5 promotes motility and invasion of breast cancer cellsWe have previously shown that glucose increases the release of CCL5 and IGF-1 by adipocytes. Now, we provide evidences that glucose did not directly interfere with their secretion by cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2A\u20132B). In order to address the biological relevance of CCL5 and IGF-1 as adipocyte-derived motility promoting factors, MDA-MB231 were co-cultured with human adipocytes in presence of specific inhibitors of CCL5 action: a monoclonal antibody raised against CCL5 (CCL5-Ab) or a peptide for the CCL5 receptor CCR5 (CCR5-pep). Both CCL5-Ab and CCR5-pep almost completely prevented STAT3 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 3) as well as the effect of adipocytes on MDA-MB231 invasiveness (Figure 2A). At variance, AG1024, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1 receptor, did not significantly reduce adipocyte action (Figure 2A). Similarly, CCL5 inhibition led to a significant reduction of wound closure of CM-treated MDA-MB231 (Figure 2B). Conversely, IGF-1 receptor inhibition did not interfere with adipocyte-induced cancer cell motility (Figure 2B).Effect of CCL5 and IGF-1 pathway inhibition on adipocyte-induced breast cancer cell motility(A) MDA-MB231 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with or without human adipocytes in the lower chamber in serum free-medium. Co-cultured cells were incubated with 6 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 Antibody (CCL5 Ab), 5 \u03bcg/ml CCR5 peptide (CCR5 pep) or 10 \u03bcM AG1024. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells without adipocytes in the lower chamber, incubated in serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (**p < 0.01). #denote statistically significant values over MDA-MB231-adipocytes co-culture (#p < 0.05).

Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by a digital camera coupled to the microscope and percentage of wound distance was calculated with the camera software. The results have been reported as percentage of gap closure at 24 h compared with time 0. A complete gap closure was considered as 100%. *denote statistically significant values over control (***p < 0.001). #denote statistically significant values over Adipo-CM treated cells (#p < 0.05). The pictures are representative of wound gaps at 0 point and upon 24 h of scratch assay. Data in the graphs represent the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent triplicate experiments.Next, we addressed whether adipocytes may control CCL5 and IGF-1 production by cancer cells. To this aim, we have measured CCL5 and IGF-1 mRNA levels in MDA-MB231 cells following adipocyte CM exposure. Adipocyte CM did not induce any significant increase of CCL5 mRNA levels in MDA-MB231 cells, while inducing IGF-1 expression (Figure 3). The presence of CCL5-Ab or CCR5-pep did not reduce CM-induced expression of IGF-1, suggesting that adipocyte-released factors different from CCL5 may control IGF-1 production by cancer cells. Moreover, AG1024 treatment did not modify CCL5 expression in MDA-MB231 cells thus indicating that IGF-1 did not control CCL5 in cancer cells (Figure 3).Cross-regulation of CCL5 and IGF-1 in cancer cellsMDA-MB231 were incubated with CM collected from human adipocytes for 24 h in presence or absence of 6 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 Ab, 5 \u03bcg/ml CCR5 pep or 10 \u03bcM AG1024. Next, mRNA levels of human CCL5 and IGF-1 were determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis as described in Materials and Methods. Bars represent the mean \u00b1 SD of four independent experiments. Bars show mRNA levels in these cells relative to those in untreated cells (cells in serum-free medium). Asterisks denote statistically significant values over untreated cells (*p < 0.05).CCL5 and IGF-1 detection in peritumoral adipose tissue of women with TNBCNext, we evaluated whether CCL5 and IGF-1 could be detected in peritumoral adipose tissue of women with breast cancer. We selected 40 invasive ductal TNBC samples. Patients\u2019 mean age was 59 years (range from 27 to 93); 12 patients (30%) were pre-menopausal and 28 (70%) post-menopausal. Tumors larger than 2 cm occurred in 52.5% (21/40) of patients. 95% (38/40) of patients had tumor with poorly differentiated cells (grade 3), while only 5% (2/40) had tumor with moderately differentiated cells (grade 2). None of the tumors was of grade 1. Metastatic lymph nodes were found in 40% (16/40) of patients at surgery and 30% (12/40) of patients developed distant metastases. The expression of the proliferation factor Ki67 was high (> 30%) in 55% (22/40), and low (\u2264 30%) in 45% (18/40) of specimens. 17.5% (7/32) of patients were diabetic and 32.5% (13/31) had a BMI greater than 30 (Table 1).Clinical and pathological features of TNBC samples\tPatients (n = 40)\t \tAge\t \tMean:59 y (range: 27\u201393)\t \t< 40\t4 (10%)\t \t\u2265 40 \u2264 60\t17 (42.5%)\t \t> 60\t19 (47.5%)\t \tGrade\t \tI\t0 (0%)\t \tII\t2 (5%)\t \tIII\t38 (95%)\t \tSize (T)\t \t\u2264 2 cm\t20 (50%)\t \t> 2 \u2264 5 cm\t17 (42.5%)\t \t> 5\t3 (3.5%)\t \tLNM\t \tYes\t16 (40%)\t \tNo\t24 (60%)\t \tMetastasis\t \tYes\t12 (30%)\t \tNo\t28 (70%)\t \tKi-67\t \t> 30\t22 (55%)\t \t\u2264 30\t18 (45%)\t \tBMI\t \tMean: 27.65 (range: 20.03\u201337.92)\t \t< 30\t18 (45%)\t \t\u2265 30\t13 (32,5%)\t \tUnknown\t9 (22.5%)\t \tDiabetes\t \tYes\t8 (20%)\t \tNo\t24 (60%)\t \tUnknown\t8 (20%)\t \tFollow up\t \tNED\t16 (40%)\t \tAWD\t10 (25%)\t \tDOD\t3 (7.5%)\t \tUnknown\t11 (27.5%)\t \tLNM = Limph node metastasis; NED = No evidence of disease; AWD = Alive with disease; DOD = Dead of disease.CCL5 and IGF-1 specific staining was detected in peritumoral adipocytes of TNBC samples (up to 1 cm distance from the tumour). CCL5 staining in peritumoral adipose tissue was detected in 16/40 samples (40%) (Figure 4).

CCL5 protein staining showed a positive, although not statistically significant correlation trend with Ki67 proliferation index (P-value = 0.085). Interestingly, CCL5 staining in peritumoral adipocyte was significantly associated with lymph node (P-value = 0.05) and distant metastases (P-value = 0.001) (Table 2). A positive trend (P-value = 0.095) between CCL5 immunoreactivity and fasting glucose levels was also revealed. No significant correlation was observed for IGF-1 staining in the adipocytes of TNBC samples with age, menopausal status, BMI, diabetes, glycaemic levels, tumour histotype, size and grading, Ki67 expression, lymph node and distant metastases (Table 2). CCL5 and IGF-1 staining was detected in peritumoral adipose tissue of 25 samples of ER positive patients whose clinical and pathological features have been described in Supplementary Table 1. CCL5 was detected in 19/25 samples (76%), while IGF-1 in 22/25 samples (88%) (data not shown). No statistically significant association was found between CCL5 or IGF-1 staining and clinical pathological parameters in ER positive cases (Supplementary Table 1).Association between CCL5 and IGF1 staining in peritumoral adipocytes and clinical pathological features\tCCL5\tIGF1\t \t\tNegative\tPositive\tP value\tR pearson\tNegative\tPositive\tP value\tR pearson\t \tAge (n = 40)\t \t< 40\t4 (100%)\t0 (0%)\t0.247\t0.253\t2 (50%)\t2 (50%)\t0.785\t\u22120.66\t \t\u2265 40 \u2264 60\t12 (70.6%)\t5 (29.4%)\t7 (41.2%)\t10 (58.8%)\t \t> 60\t11 (57.9%)\t8 (42.1%)\t10 (52.6%)\t9 (47.4%)\t \tMenopause (n = 40)\t \tPre-\t8 (66.6%)\t4 (43.4%)\t0,941\t\u22120,012\t5 (41.7%)\t7 (58.3%)\t0,490\t\u22120.109\t \tPost-\t19 (67.9%)\t9 (32.1%)\t15 (53.6%)\t13 (46.4%)\t \tSize (n = 40)\t \t\u2264 2 cm\t14 (70%)\t6 (30%)\t0.943\t0.045\t9 (45%)\t11 (55%)\t0.781\t\u22120.086\t \t> 2 \u2264 5\t11 (64.7%)\t6 (35.3%)\t8 (47%)\t9 (53%)\t \t> 5\t2 (66.6%)\t1 (33.4%)\t2 (66.6%)\t1 (33.4%)\t \tLNM (n = 40)\t \tNegative\t19 (82.6%)\t5 (17.4%)\t0.05*\t0.305\t10 (41.6%)\t14 (58.4%)\t0.366\t\u22120.143\t \tPositive\t8 (50%)\t8 (50%)\t9 (56.3%)\t7 (43.7%)\t \tMetastasis (n = 40)\t \tNegative\t24 (82.6%)\t5 (17.4%)\t0.001**\t0,529\t12 (41.4%)\t17 (58.6%)\t0.208\t\u22120.199\t \tPositive\t3 (27.3%)\t8 (32.7%)\t7 (63.6%)\t4 (36.4%)\t \tGrade (n = 40)\t \tG1\t0 (0%)\t0 (0%)\t0.314\t0.159\t0 (0%)\t0 (0%)\t0.942\t0.011\t \tG2\t2 (100%)\t0 (0%)\t1 (50%)\t1 (50%)\t \tG3\t25 (65.8%)\t13 (34.2%)\t18 (47.4%)\t20 (52.6%)\t \tKi67 (n = 40)\t \t\u2264 30%\t14 (82.3%)\t3 (17.7%)\t0.085\t0.273\t7 (41.2%)\t10 (58.8%)\t0.491\t\u22120.109\t \t> 30%\t13 (56.5%)\t10 (43.5%)\t12 (52.3%)\t11 (47.7%)\t \tBMI (n = 31)\t \t< 30\t13 (72.2%)\t5 (37.8%)\t0.530\t0.113\t7 (38.9%)\t11 (61.1%)\t0.686\t\u22120.073\t \t\u2265 30\t8 (61.5%)\t5 (38.5%)\t6 (46.2%)\t7 (53.8%)\t \tDiabetes (n = 32)\t \tNo\t17 (70.8%)\t7 (29.2%)\t0.283\t0.190\t12 (50%)\t12 (50%)\t0.539\t0.108\t \tYes\t4 (50%)\t4 (50%)\t3 (37.5%)\t5 (62.5%)\t \tGlycaemia (n = 22)\t \t< 110\t12 (75%)\t4 (25%)\t0.095\t0.102\t6 (37.5%)\t10 (62.5%)\t0.479\t\u22120.044\t \t\u2265 110 < 126\t0 (0%)\t2 (100%)\t0 (0%)\t2 (100%)\t \t\u2265 126\t3 (75%)\t1 (25%)\t2 (50%)\t2 (50%)\t \tLNM = Limph Node Metastasis.

At variance, IGF-1 peritumoral adipocyte staining was not associated with the overall survival (P-value = 0.909) (Figure 6B).CCL5 and IGF-1 Kaplan-Meier overall survival curvesGreen lines represent patients expressing CCL5 (A) or IGF-1 (B) in peritumoral adipose tissue.

In cancer, the coordinated intercellular interactions are disrupted as the tumor acquires the capacity to chronically circumvent normalizing cues from the microenvironment, and in turn, the microenvironment evolves to accommodate the growing tumor.We have addressed whether peritumoral adipose tissue may modify cancer cell invasiveness. For this purpose, we have used Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells (which stain negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2) and human mammary adipocytes. TNBCs account for 10\u201324% of invasive breast cancers and are typically high-grade tumors with different histological types. Usually, patients with TNBC have a higher recurrence rate after diagnosis, a short disease-free interval and a reduced overall survival, mainly for the lack of targeted therapies.Adipocytes are active and important modulators of mammary tumor microenvironment. Data mainly obtained in cultured murine cell models have suggested that adipocyte factors, including a wide array of adipokines, cytokines and growth factors, promote survival, growth and motility of cancer cells.Here, we show that TNBC cells display increased motility and invasiveness when co-cultured with human adipocytes. Interestingly, raising glucose concentrations further increased the promoting action of adipocytes on cancer cell motility. As also previously reported by others, higher glucose concentrations per se may enhance breast cancer cell growth and motility, by providing fuel for the increasing energy demand. However, experiments with co-culture and conditioned media have indicated that glucose increases the release of adipocyte factors, which, even in lower glucose concentrations, are capable to enhance cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Thus, high glucose levels may facilitate cancer progression by acting either directly on cancer cells or indirectly on the surrounding adipose cells.These in vitro observations are consistent with the evidence that: i) the epidemic surge of obesity and diabetes mellitus is paralleled by increased onset and progression of oncologic disorders, including breast cancer; ii) hyperglycaemia represents an independent risk factor for cancer progression; iii) tumour microenvironment responds to metabolic imbalance and accounts for several modifications occurring in cancer phenotypes.All together these observations indicate that the adipose tissue within the tumour microenvironment may sense metabolic derangements and worsen breast cancer progression.When cultured in high glucose concentrations or with fatty acids, adipocytes release a larger amount of IGF-1 and CCL5, without changing the secretion of several other factors. We have now shown that CCL5 is needed for breast cancer cell motility and invasion promoted by adipocytes. Indeed, either blocking CCL5 with a neutralizing antibody or preventing CCL5 binding to its CCR5 receptor reduced adipocyte effect on TNBC cell motility and invasiveness. At variance, an IGF-1/Insulin pathway inhibitor had no effect on adipocyte action, suggesting that adipocyte-released IGF-1 is dispensable (notably, insulin is not released by adipocytes and is not present in culture medium).CCL5 is a chemokine that has been associated to several forms of cancer. Elevated circulating levels of CCL5 have been found both in diabetic and in obese individuals. Nevertheless, CCL5/CCR5 expression levels are different among the different genetic subtypes of breast cancer and may represent a negative prognostic factor. However, tumor-derived CCL5 apparently does not contribute to breast cancer progression. It has been shown that CCL5 induces the invasion of basal breast cancer cells (i.e. MDA-MB-231 cells) but not of luminal breast cancer cells (i.e. MCF-7 cells). In agreement, increased CCL5 circulating levels have been found predominantly in ER-negative patients.Here, we have developed an immunohistochemical method to detect CCL5 and IGF-1 in tumor-associated adipose tissue specimens. This was a relevant achievement since very few markers have been analyzed in adipose cells through in-situ techniques. We were also able to establish an adequate evaluation score. Interestingly, in TNBCs, CCL5, while not IGF-1, immunodetection is significantly associated with lymph node and distant metastases. Consistently, a negative association of CCL5 staining in TNBC-associated adipose tissue with overall survival is suggestive of a more aggressive cancer behavior. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of a potential prognostic marker in peri-tumoral adipose tissue. Further work is needed to analyze the association between CCL5 and IGF-1 staining in adipose tissue and cancer features of patient with ER positive cancer.Most likely, CCL5 is largely produced by adipocytes. Indeed, no induction of CCL5 gene expression by adipocyte factors has been detected in breast cancer cells. Since CCL5 could act locally promoting cell movement, it could be involved in cancer invasion of the surrounding adipose tissue, which is one of the biologic indicators of tumor aggressiveness.CCL5 binds to its cognate receptor CCR5 and activates Jak kinases, STAT3, mTOR and p38 MAP kinase regulating the engagement of multiple signaling pathways. It mediates the trafficking and homing of classical lymphoid cells such as T cells and monocytes, but also acts on a range of other cells, including basophils, eosinophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells and mast cells. Upon recruitment of immune cells, inflamed adipose tissue may further promote growth of malignant cells by inducing vascular endothelium and activating proinflammatory cells.Recently, genomic profiling studies have identified specific subtypes for TNBC with differential aggressiveness potential. These studies have evidenced that the Basal-Like Immune Activated subtype, which display up-regulation of genes controlling B cell, T cell, natural killer cell functions and inflammatory cytokines, was among the most aggressive molecular subtypes. Therefore, it is plausible that excess adiposity, as well as high blood glucose levels, may contribute to the production of inflammation/immunity-related factors, which may worsen cancer prognosis in metabolically deranged individuals. It should be pointed out that, although not reaching statistical significance, higher glycaemic levels are also associated with CCL5 detection in TNBC specimens. Further studies are needed to analyse CCL5 levels in serum of TNBC patients.Thus, we described that CCL5 release by adipocytes contributes to increase motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. CCL5 is detectable in peritumoral adipose tissue of TNBCs and correlates with lymph node and distant metastases and with the reduction of patient overall survival. This is a relevant issue since, so far, no effective molecular targeted drug is available for TNBC. In this regard, CCR5 antagonists are widely used for the treatment of HIV infection. Moreover, in animal models, CCL5 knockout does not affect general physiology and broad immunity, suggesting that specific targeted inhibition may have strong therapeutic impact without over-toxicity.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsMedia, sera, and antibiotics for cell culture were from Lonza (Lonza Group Ltd, Basel, Switzerland). Anti-CCL5 and IGF1 antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Anti-Er\u03b1, PR, c-Erb B2 and Ki67 antibodies were purchased from DAKO (Ely, UK). All the other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).Peptide synthesisThe synthesis of peptide CCR5-pep (sequence: AFDWTFVPSLIL-NH2) was performed according to the solid-phase approach using standard Fmoc methodology in a manual reaction vessel. N\u03b1-Fmoc-protected amino acids, Rinkamide-resin, N-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt), 2-(1Hbenzotriazole-1-yl)21,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), N, N-diisopropylethyl-amine (DIPEA), piperidine and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Iris Biotech (Germany). Peptide synthesis solvents, reagents, as well as CH3CN for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were reagent grade and were acquired from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The first amino acid, N\u03b1Fmoc-Leu-OH was linked on to the Rink resin (100\u2013200 mesh, 1% divinylbenzene, 0.75 mmol/g) previously deprotected by a 25% piperidine solution in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 30 min.The following protected amino acids were then added stepwise: N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ile-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Leu-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ser(tBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Pro-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Val-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Phe-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Thr(tBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Asp(OtBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ala-OH,. Each coupling reaction was accomplished using a threefold excess of amino acid with HBTU and HOBt in the presence of DIPEA (6 eq.). The Na-Fmoc protecting groups were removed by treating the protected peptide resin with a 25% solution of piperidine in DMF (1 \u00d7 5 min and 1 \u00d7 25 min).The peptide resin was washed three times with DMF, and the next coupling step was initiated in a stepwise manner. The peptide resin was washed with dichloromethane (DCM) (3\u00d7), DMF (3\u00d7), and DCM (3\u00d7), and the deprotection protocol was repeated after each coupling step. In addition, after each step of deprotection and after each coupling step, Kaiser test was performed to confirm the complete removal of the Fmoc protecting group, respectively, and to verify that complete coupling has occurred on all the free amines on the resin.The N-terminal Fmoc group was removed as described above, and the peptide was released from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/triisopropylsilane(iPr3SiH)/H2O (90:5:5) for 3 h. The resin was removed by filtration, and the crude peptide was recovered by precipitation with cold anhydrous ethyl ether to give a white powder and then lyophilized.Purification and characterizationAll crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a semipreparative C18-bonded silica column (Phenomenex, Jupiter, 250 mm 3 10 mm) using a Shimadzu SPD 10A UV/VIS detector, with detection at 210 and 254 nm.The column was perfused at a flow rate of 3 ml/min for 40 min with solvent A (10%, vol/vol, water in 0.1% aqueous TFA), and a linear gradient from 10 to 90% of solvent B (80%, vol/vol, acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous TFA). Analytical purity and retention time (tR) of each peptide were determined using HPLC conditions in the above solvent system (solvents A and B) programmed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient from 10 to 90% B over 25 min, fitted with C-18 column Phenomenex, Juppiter C-18 column (250 mm 3 4.60 mm; 5 mm).All analogues showed > 97% purity when monitored at 215 nm. Homogeneous fractions, as established using analytical HPLC, were pooled and lyophilized.Peptides molecular weights were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ESI-MS analysis in positive ion mode were made using a Finnigan liquid chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry (LCQ) ion trap instrument, manufactured by Thermo Finnigan (San Jose, CA), equipped with the Excalibur software for processing the data acquired. The sample was dissolved in a mixture of water and methanol (50/50) and injected directly into the electrospray source, using a syringe pump, which maintains constant flow at 5 ml/min. The temperature of the capillary was set at 220\u00b0C.Cell culturesMDA-MB-231 (ER\u03b1, PgR and HER2 negative) and MCF-7 (ER\u03b1, PgR positive and HER2 negative) human breast cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin. Cultures were kept in humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 C. Human adipose tissue samples were obtained from mammary adipose tissue biopsies of healthy women (n = 12; age 25\u201363 years; BMI 24.2\u201329.0) undergoing surgical mammary reduction. All women were otherwise healthy and free of metabolic or endocrine diseases. Informed consent was obtained from every subject before the surgical procedure. The ethical committee of the University of Naples approved this procedure. Adipose tissue was digested with collagenase and Adipose-derived Stromal Vascular Fraction cells (SVF) were isolated and differentiated as previously reported. Conditioned media (CM) were obtained by incubating the cells for 8 h with serum-free DMEM 0.25% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) after two washes with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). After the incubation, medium was collected and centrifuged at 14000 g to remove cellular debris and placed onto recipient cells.Co-culture and invasion assayCell invasiveness was examined using a reconstituted extracellular matrix (1.5 mg/ml Matrigel; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) coated on polycarbonate membranes of the upper compartment of a 24 well transwell system (8 \u03bcm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA). 24 h serum-starved MDA-MB231 cells (1 \u00d7 103 cells/well) were seeded on the matrigel-coated membrane and co-cultivated with either differentiated adipocytes or with undifferentiated SVF cells in the bottom chamber in serum-free medium. Alternatively, adipocyte CM was placed in the bottom of the transwell. Then, cells were allowed to invade the matrix and migrate into the lower chamber at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere saturated with H2O for 24 h. At the end of incubation, the upper surface of the membrane was swiped to remove the attached cells. The cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filter were fixed with 11% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet-20% methanol for 20 min at room temperature. After three PBS washes and complete drying at room temperature, the crystal violet was solubilized by immersing the filters in 10% acetic acid. The concentration of the solubilized crystal violet was evaluated as absorbance at 540 nm.Scratch assayScratch assay was performed as previously described. Briefly, MDA-MB231 cells were starved in serum-free DMEM-F12 0.25% BSA for 16 h. Confluent monolayers were wounded by manually scratching with a p20 pipette tip. They were next washed twice with PBS and incubated at 37 C with mitomycin C (10 mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and adipocyte CM. Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by the Olympus DP20 microscope digital camera system (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and percentage of closure was calculated with a dedicated software.Real-time RT-PCR analysisTotal RNA was isolated from MDA-MB231 cells by using the Rneasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 1 \u03bcg RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using an iCycler IQ multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All reactions were performed in triplicate and \u03b2-actin was used as an internal standard.

These patients were different from those ones enrolled for adipose tissue biopsies. As for Institutional statistics, TNBCs represent 15\u201319% of the total number of breast cancer surgical samples. All cases of TNBC samples were reviewed according to WHO classification criteria, using standard tissue sections and appropriate immunohistochemical slides. Medical records for all cases of TNBC samples were reviewed for clinical information, including histologic parameters that were determined from the H and E slides. The following clinical and pathological parameters were evaluated for each tumor included in the study: patient age at initial diagnosis, tumor size, histologic subtype, nuclear grade, nodal status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor stage, tumor recurrence or distant metastasis and type of surgery (for tumor removal). In addition, all specimens were characterized for all routinely diagnostic immunophenotypic parameters.Immunohistochemistry analysisCCL5, IGF-1, ER\u03b1, PR, c-ErbB and KI67 staining was evaluated on slides of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed on slides heated in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a bath for 20 minutes at 97 C. After antigen retrieval, the slides were allowed to cool. The slides were rinsed with Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) and the endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. After protein blocking (BSA 5% PBS 1\u00d7), slides were incubated with primary antibody to human CCL5 (dilution 1:100) and IGF-1 (dilution 1:500) over night and to human ER\u03b1 (dilution 1:35), PR (dilution 1:50), c-Erb B2 (dilution 1:300) and Ki67 (dilution 1:75) for 30 min. The sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated for 20 min with Biotinylated Secondary Antibody (RE7103, Novocastra, Nussloch, Germany). Then, sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated for 20 min with Streptavidin-HRP (RE7104, Novocastra, Nussloch, Germany). Peroxidase reactivity was visualized using a 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted.Immunohistochemistry evaluationTwo trained pathologists using a light microscopy evaluated antigen immunoreactivity independently. Observer was unaware of the clinical outcome. For each sample, at least five High Power Fields (HPF) (inside the tumor and in the area exhibiting tumor invasion) and > 500 cells were analysed. Using a microscopically semi-quantitative scoring system and referring to each antigen scoring method in other studies, we evaluated the intensity, extent and subcellular distribution of CCL5 and IGF-1.The proliferative index Ki67 was defined as the percentage of immunoreactive tumour cells out of the total number of cells. The percentage of positive cells per case was scored according to 2 different groups: group 1: < 30% (low proliferative activity); group 2: > 30% (high proliferative activity).There were no standardized criteria for CCL5 and IGF-1 adipose staining evaluation. We evaluated CCL5 and IGF1 protein reactivity in peritumoral adipocytes (until one centimeter from the tumor), considering only the positive or negative staining. CCL5 and IGF-1 detection in lymphocytes and macrophages was considered as internal positive control.Other routinely used diagnostic markers (ER\u03b1, PR and c-Erb B2) were evaluated as previously described.Statistical analysisThe Pearson \u03c72 test was used to analyze the association between CCL5 and IGF-1 staining in peritumoral adipocytes and clinical pathological features included in the study. The level of significance was defined as P < 0.05. Overall survival (OS) curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the significance was evaluated using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis (first biopsy) to death by any cause or until the most recent follow-up. The follow-up duration was five years. All the statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Science v. 20 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND TABLECONFLICTS OF INTERESTAll authors have no conflicts of interest.FINANCIAL SUPPORTAssociazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC n.

        "content": "Increasing evidence suggests that interaction between the chemoattractant CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha and its receptor CXCR4 plays a pivotal role in the metastasis of various tumors. Our previous studies showed that multi-component Chinese herbal medicines inhibited the effects of CXCL12/CXCR4. As a result of sequential chromatographic fractionation of one herbal medicine ingredient, Lianqiao (fruit of Forsythia suspensa), we observed that tannins were, at least in part, responsible for this activity. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-CXCL12/CXCR4 activity of a commercial tannic acid and evaluate its potential to inhibit tumor cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro. The inhibitory effect of tannic acid on CXCL12/CXCR4 was measured by chemotaxis assay, ligand binding assay, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The antiangiogenic effect of tannic acid was assessed by in vitro endothelial cell tube formation. Tannic acid, at nontoxic concentrations, specifically inhibited CXCL12-induced human monocyte migration (IC(50), 7.5 micro g/ml) but did not inhibit CCL2-, CCL3-, CCL5-, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP)-, or C5a-induced migration. The compound markedly blocked CXCL12 binding to THP-1 cells (IC(50), 0.36 micro g/ml). Tannic acid also inhibited CXCL12-induced, but not epidermal growth factor-induced, migration of MDA 231 breast tumor cells. Additionally, 0.5 micro g/ml of tannic acid selectively inhibited CXCL12-mediated, but not basic fibroblast growth factor- or endothelial cell growth supplement-mediated, bovine aorta endothelial cell capillary tube formation. These studies indicate that tannic acid is a novel selective CXCL12/CXCR4 antagonist and consequently may provide a mechanistic basis for the reported antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties of tannic acid.",

Thus, PFD has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.INTRODUCTIONCollagen, mainly produced by fibroblasts, is the most abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in the stroma. Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

        "content": "The interaction between cancer and its local microenvironment can determine properties of growth and metastasis. A critical component of the tumor microenvironment in this context is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), which can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. It has been hypothesized that CAF may be derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), derived from local or distant sources. However, the signaling mechanisms by which tumors and MSCs interact to promote CAF-dependent cancer growth are largely unknown. In this study with in vitro and in vivo models using MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells, we demonstrate that tumor-derived osteopontin (OPN) induces MSC production of CCL5; the mechanism involves OPN binding to integrin cell surface receptors and activator protein-1 c-jun homodimer transactivation. In a murine xenograft model, concomitant inoculation of MSC with MDA-MB231 cells induces: (i) significantly increased growth and metastasis of MB231 cells and (ii) increased MSC migration to metastatic sites in lung and liver; this mechanism is both OPN and CCL5 dependent. MSCs retrieved from sites of metastases exhibit OPN-dependent expression of the CAF markers, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, tenascin-c, CXCL12 (or stromal cell-derived factor 1) and fibroblast-specific protein-1 and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Based upon these results, we propose that tumor-derived OPN promotes tumor progression via the transformation of MSC into CAF.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

Our results suggest that MEKK1 contributes to the formation of a breast tumor microenvironment that supports metastasis by promoting expression of stroma cell chemokine genes in response to tumor cell-induced paracrine signaling.IntroductionIn addition to transformed mammary epithelial cells, breast tumors consist of an array of non-transformed stroma cells that interact with cancer cells and infiltrate the tumor mass. Evidence compiled from gene expression studies, creative in vivo imaging experiments and 3D culture approaches to recreate the tumor environment support a model wherein stroma cells influence tumor cell function. The possibility that this diverse cellular milieu might influence tumor progression and response to therapy has spurred considerable interest in the role of breast stroma cells in the tumor environment. Some reported examples include cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that promote tumor cell growth and metastasis, and tumor-associated macrophages forming a paracrine \u201cpas de deux\u201d with cancer cells to provoke mutual migration. These examples and others show that stroma cells can promote metastasis through the expression and secretion of factors such as cytokines that bind receptors on tumor cells to induce functional responses ranging from proliferation to cell migration. The CC class of chemokines are known to induce immune cell chemotaxis, and CAFs have been shown to express CCL proteins. Indeed, several lines of evidence support a role for CCL chemokines in tumor progression. For example, Silzle and colleagues demonstrated that CAFs produce CCL2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, and CAF-induced monocyte recruitment in a co-culture system required CCL2. In addition, both CAFs harvested from breast tumors and normal renal fibroblasts have been found to express CCL5/RANTES, and CCL5 has been found to be highly expressed in aggressive breast tumors. Largely characterized in the regulation of T cell and monocyte function in immune response, CCL5 induces chemotaxis when bound by its high affinity receptors, including the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor CCR5. Interestingly, some tumor cells express chemokine receptors as well, suggesting that stromal fibroblast\u00a0chemokine production can influence the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor cell migration and invasion. CCL5 can induce breast tumor cell migration through binding and activation of CCR5, and an inhibitory mutant CCL5 (met-RANTES) inhibits breast tumor growth and migration. In addition to CCL5, CCR5 has been shown to bind multiple chemokine ligands, including CCL3 and CCL4. Overall, these reports suggest that this nexus of tumor cells that express CCR5 and stroma cell-derived CC class chemokine ligands provide breast cancer investigators a new set of novel therapeutic targets. Due to the role of CCR5 as a key factor in HIV infection, CCR5 inhibitors such as Maraviroc/UK-427,857 have been developed and approved for use as anti-retroviral therapy in HIV patients. Taken together, studies showing that CCR5 ligands may be highly expressed in breast tumors suggests that therapeutics designed to prevent viral infection of T cells may be useful if repurposed as cancer drugs.The current understanding of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that control CCL expression is less developed than that of CCR5 function. Transcription of CCL5 expression is at least partly under control of transcription factor response elements within the 5\u2019 promoter region that are bound by AP-1 and NF\u03baB transcription factor proteins. AP-1 (activating protein 1) dimeric transcription factors control gene expression in response to a formidable array of environmental stimuli, and are regulated by both phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. NF\u03baB also is regulated by upstream kinase activity that is required to relieve inhibition by regulatory proteins. AP-1 regulators include the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), with multiple isoforms of the ERK, JNK, and p38 proteins that have long been established as AP-1 regulators that both directly phosphorylate AP-1 proteins and indirectly control AP-1 function by activating MAPK-dependent kinases that consequently phosphorylate AP-1 proteins. MAPK activity is tightly controlled by a complex network that mediates MAPK phosphorylation, dephosphorylation and ubiquitylation, but at the core of MAPK control is the consecutive activation of three kinases that form the canonical MAPK cascade, consisting of a MAPK that is phosphorylated and activated by a MAPK kinase (MAP2K) that is, in turn, phosphorylated and activated by a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K). MEKK1 is a MAP3K protein\u00a0that our group and others have shown the MAP3K MEKK1 to be a key regulator of both ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK activity. MEKK1 activity promotes AP-1 phosphorylation and activation, and also has been shown to phosphorylate and activate I\u03baB kinases, leading to NF\u03baB activation. Furthermore, our group and others have demonstrated that MEKK1 further\u00a0controls AP-1 activity through control protein stability, thus identifying MEKK1 as a key regulator of both AP-1-dependent and NF\u03baB-dependent gene transcription and expression.Our earlier work revealed that MEKK1-deficient mice are resistant to transgene-induced breast tumor metastasis, and that MEKK1 is necessary for expression of cancer cell proteases that are associated with breast tumor cell invasiveness, but did not define the role of stroma cells in these breast tumors. In the present study, we model the breast tumor microenvironment by exposing mammary fibroblasts to soluble factors derived from breast tumor cells, and then perform expression array analysis of mammary fibroblasts, comparing cells that express MEKK1 to MEKK1-decient cells. We reveal that MEKK1 regulates chemokine expression in mammary fibroblasts that induces breast tumor cell migration. Our results indicate that MEKK1 controls metastasis-related functions of both cancer cells and\u00a0non-cancer stroma cells, and thereby plays a key role in determining the nature of the breast tumor cellular environment that influences tumor metastasis.Materials and MethodsAntibodies and ReagentsAntibodies specific for MEKK1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-pERK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), CAY10512 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), SSR128129E was purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX), Maraviroc, and PEITC were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).Cell Culture and TransfectionMDA-MB 231 breast tumor cells, HTB-125 human mammary fibroblast cells and primary mouse mammary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium) (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) at 37\u00b0C and maintained in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. All transfections were conducted using linear polyethylenimine (PEI, MW 25000, Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Briefly, PEI was dissolved in water and mixed with DNA vectors at a 3:1 ratio (\u00b5g/\u00b5g) in OptiMEM (Life Technologies) and allowed to form complexes for 20\u00a0min at room temperature prior to adding the complexed DNA dropwise to cells in culture. Cells were harvested 48\u00a0h post-transfection.Isolating Primary Mammary FibroblastsThe inguinal mammary glands from 8-10 week-old female mice were removed, minced to <1mm pieces and then mixed with serum-free DMEM. The tissue was digested at 37C with shaking in 2.5 mg/ml collagenase type 3 (Worthington), 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma) and 100 U/ml pen/strep (Life Technologies) for 3\u00a0h. The digestion mixture was then allowed to rest at room temperature for 10\u00a0min to allow the fat to collect at the top of the fluid and an epithelial cell pellet to form at the bottom of the tube. The fat is then removed and the cell suspension is transferred to a new sterile centrifuge tube. The pellet is discarded. The cell suspension is centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 10\u00a0min, and the fluid discarded. The pellet containing the fibroblasts is re-suspended in DMEM with 10% serum and transferred to 10\u00a0cm tissue culture plates.RNA Extraction and Expression ArraysTotal cell RNA was extracted with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Reverse transcription, cDNA synthesis and expression array hybridization, chip reading and preliminary analysis of the array results were performed by the Northwestern University Genomics CORE facility. An Illumina Mouse 8 chip platform was utilized to compare expression of mammary fibroblasts derived from six mice (3 \u00d7 MEKK1+/+, 3 \u00d7 MEKK1\u2212/\u2212), whereas an Illumina Human chip was utilized to determine gene expression in three separate replicates of MDA-MB 231 cells. Array expression data were z-score normalized and statistical inference was performed according to Cheadle et\u00a0al.. Heat map image representing normalized expression data was generated in MATLAB.ImmunoblottingProteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred on to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder diluted in TBST (20 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20, adjusted to pH 7.6) or 5% globulin-free BSA (Sigma) in TBST and incubated in the appropriate antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight. After extensive washing, the membranes were then incubated with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)\u2013conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or HRP\u2013sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham-GE Healthcare) secondary antibodies for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the targeted proteins were detected by ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence, Thermo Scientific). Where indicated, blots were stripped by treatment with 2% (w/v) SDS and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol in TBS, and then re-probed with the desired antibodies.CCL5 Reporter AssayThe Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System reagent kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and reporter assays using transfected cell lysates were performed as per manufacturer recommendations. The pGL2-CCL5-220 reporter plasmid was a generous gift of Dr. Antonella Casola (University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX). Fibroblasts transfected with reporter vectors were exposed to either breast tumor cell-conditioned media or regular growth media +/- indicated drugs for indicated times prior to lysis and quantification of reporter activity.CCL5 ELISAHTB-125 human breast fibroblast cells were treated with MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium for 1, 2 and 4\u00a0h, after which the conditioned medium was replaced with regular growth medium for 24\u00a0h. The culture supernatants were then collected and any cells removed by filtration. CCL5 concentration was determined using the ELISA for human CCL5/RANTES Kit (R&D Systems Inc. Cat# DY278-05) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, 300 \u00b5l of reagent diluent were placed in the capture antibody-coated wells to block plate for 1\u00a0h. After washing, 100 \u00b5l of test samples or standards were added per well and incubated 2\u00a0h. The wells were then washed and incubated with 100 \u00b5l of detection antibody for 2\u00a0h. After washing, 100 \u00b5l of the working dilution of streptavidin-HRP was added to each well for 20\u00a0min. Following wash step, 100 \u00b5l of substrate solution was added before incubation for 20\u00a0min. The color reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u00b5l of stop solution and the absorbance of the samples was measured using an ELISA plate reader. The CCL5 concentrations were calculated based on the standard curve.Breast Cancer Cell Migration AssayMDA-MB 231 cells were suspended in serum-free medium containing either CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc (10 \u00b5M) or DMSO. Chemotaxis was assessed by Transwell (Corning) assay, wherein 105 cells were allowed to migrate through a filter (8 \u00b5m pore) toward 4% serum for 5\u00a0h, and then migrating cells were stained with Wright\u2019s stain and counted.ResultsPrimary Mammary Fibroblasts Induce MEKK1-Dependent Chemotaxis in MDA-MB 231 Breast Tumor CellsWe previously reported that transgene-induced breast tumor metastasis is significantly delayed in MEKK1-deficient mice, and the tumors markedly less invasive. Breast tumors arising in the ductal lumen are surrounded by basement membrane and assorted stroma cells, including mammary fibroblasts capable of secreting factors that promote tumor cell invasion. To determine whether MEKK1 is required for mammary fibroblasts to induce tumor cell invasiveness, we isolated primary fibroblasts from the mammary glands of both MEKK1+/+ and MEKK1\u2212/\u2212 mice and used these cells to condition media for use as an invasion assay chemoattractant. We found that media conditioned by mammary fibroblasts consistently induced MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell invasion in an in vitro assay ( Figure 1 ). However, tumor cell invasiveness was significantly diminished when media conditioned by MEKK1-deficient fibroblasts is utilized as the chemoattractant ( Figure 1 ). Since direct contact with fibroblasts was not required to induce invasion, these results indicate that the one or more fibroblast-derived factors capable of promoting breast tumor invasiveness is under the control of MEKK1. In order to identify the MEKK1-dependent secreted proteins, we investigated gene expression in mammary fibroblasts.MEKK1 expression is necessary for mammary fibroblasts to promote breast tumor cell invasion. The graph depicts results from BioCoat Matrigel assays of MDA-MB 231 cell invasiveness induced by media that had been conditioned by either MEKK1+/+ or MEKK1\u2212/\u2212 mammary fibroblasts for 72\u00a0h. The data represented in graph are derived from at least three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 by paired t-test.Breast Tumor Cells Induce MEKK1-Dependent Chemokine Expression in Mammary FibroblastsTo identify MEKK1-dependent secreted factors that could induce breast tumor cell migration and invasion, we performed array analysis comparing gene expression in mammary fibroblasts harvested from both MEKK1+/+ (n=3) and MEKK1\u2212/\u2212 mice (n=3). To model fibroblast gene expression induced by the secretory breast tumor environment, we exposed fibroblasts to media conditioned by MDA-MB 231 cells. We focused on identifying MEKK1-dependent genes that encode soluble factors known to promote cell migration, and we discovered that expression of several CC class chemokines displayed reduced expression in MEKK1-deficient fibroblasts ( Figure 2 ). Intriguingly, several chemokines that are ligands for the receptor CCR5 (murine CCL3, 4, 5, 6, and 12) displayed reduced expression in MEKK1-deficient cells in either basal conditions, induced conditions, or both. CCL5 expression in particular was reduced under both basal and induced conditions in MEKK1-deficient cells compared to fibroblasts that express MEKK1 ( Figure 2 , basal conditions: 3.16-fold reduction, p=0.017, induced conditions: 2.8-fold reduction, p=0.029). Although reduced in MEKK1 knockout cells, CCL5 expression was induced significantly by breast tumor cell-conditioned media in both MEKK1+/+ and MEKK1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts, indicating that control of induced CCL5 expression is at least partly independent of MEKK1.CCL5 expression in primary mammary fibroblasts is enhanced by MEKK1. Heat map of z-score normalized microarray expression data for 36 chemokines in primary mammary fibroblasts cultured from six mice (3\u00d7 MEKK1+/+ and 3\u00d7 MEKK1\u2212/\u2212) either unstimulated (CTL) or induced with cultured medium from MDA-MB-231 cells (231CM). Columns show mean expression by group (N=4 culture replicates per condition), with asterisks indicating significance by z-tests with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate adjustment for multiple testing. *FDR < 0.05, **FDR <0.01, ***FDR < 0.001, \u2020unadjusted p < 0.05.To determine whether breast tumor-derived soluble factors can induce CCL5 protein expression in human mammary fibroblasts, we measured the CCL5 protein produced by HTB-125 human mammary fibroblasts exposed to MDA-MB 231 cell-conditioned media ( Figure 3 ). We observed that CCL5 protein production was significantly increased in human fibroblasts exposed to breast tumor cell factors compared to untreated fibroblasts. Furthermore, we observed that fibroblasts that were exposed to tumor cell-conditioned media for 4\u00a0h produced significantly more CCL5 protein than fibroblasts exposed to tumor cell factors for 2\u00a0h, suggesting that the magnitude of the fibroblast CCL5 protein production is dose-dependent. Together, our mRNA and protein data indicate that soluble factors produced by breast tumor cells can induce CCL5 protein production in non-tumor mammary stroma cells. Given the reported role of CCL5 in tumor metastasis, we then directed our investigation to define the mechanisms by which MEKK1 controls CCL5 expression.Breast tumor cells stimulate CCL5 protein production in human mammary fibroblasts. The graph depicts results from CCL5 ELISA analysis of cell culture supernatant from HTB-125 human mammary fibroblasts exposed to 231CM compared to supernatant from fibroblasts maintained in regular growth media. Fibroblasts exposed to tumor cell-conditioned media were treated for 2\u00a0h or 4\u00a0h, after which the media was replaced growth media. 24\u00a0h later the media were collected and subjected to ELISA analysis. The data represented in graph are derived from at least three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 against control by t-test.CCL5 Expression Requires MEKK1 Kinase Activity, but Not Ubiquitin Ligase ActivityMEKK1 is unique among kinases in that it contains ubiquitin ligase activity. We previously reported that MEKK1 kinase activity was a key component in the regulation of AP-1 transcription factor activity and function, and we demonstrated that MEKK1 ubiquitin ligase activity plays a role in transcription factor ubiquitylation and stability. MEKK1 phosphorylates the kinases MEK4 and MEK1/2, thereby activating MAPK proteins JNK and ERK1/2. MEKK1 also phosphorylates and activates IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, promoting phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of NF\u03baB inhibitor protein IKB and the consequent activation of NF\u03baB. To determine whether either MEKK1 kinase activity or ubiquitin ligase activity is necessary for CCL5 expression, we transfected mammary fibroblasts with vectors encoding either wild type MEKK1, kinase-inactive mutant MEKK1 (K1253M), or ubiquitin ligase-inactive mutant MEKK1 (C441A), and co-transfected with a CCL5 luciferase-based reporter vector. In our assay, luciferase expression is driven by the proximal 200 bases of the Ccl5 promoter that is reported to contain both NF\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factor response elements. Our reporter assays revealed that CCL5 reporter activity was markedly induced by co-expression of wild type or ubiquitin ligase-mutant MEKK1, whereas kinase inactive mutant MEKK1 did not induce CCL5 promoter activity ( Figure 4A ), indicating that kinase activity is necessary for MEKK1 to promote CCL5 expression. In order to compare the relative CCL5 production of cancer and stroma cells, we utilized ELISA analysis to quantify CCL5 protein secreted by both breast cancer cell lines and mammary fibroblasts that had been harvested from murine mammary tumors (cancer-associate fibroblasts,). To determine whether CCL5 secretion varies among breast cancer cells, we tested media conditioned by breast cancer cell lines that are commonly used to model distinct breast cancer types, including luminal (MCF7), HER2+ (SKBr3), and triple negative (MDA-MB 231) breast cancers. Strikingly, we found that cancer-associated fibroblasts secreted greater than 60-fold more CCL5 protein than any of the breast cancer cells ( Figure 4B ).MEKK1 kinase activity, but not ubiquitin ligase activity, is required to induce CCL5 expression. Gene reporter and ELISA analysis are used to determine whether transfection of kinase-inactive mutant MEKK1 (K1253M) or ubiquitin ligase-inactive mutant MEKK1 (C441A) induces CCL5 expression. (A, D) Graphs depict CCL5 reporter analysis of mammary fibroblasts transfected with the pGL2-CCL5-220 luciferase reporter vector and a pCDNA3.1/MEKK1 expression vector. **p < 0.01 by t-test. (B) CCL5 ELISA analysis of cell culture supernatant from both multiple breast tumor cell lines compared to cell culture supernatant of cancer-associated mammary fibroblasts. (C) Graph shows both AP-1 and NF\u03baB reporter analysis of mammary fibroblasts transfected with either the pGL2-AP-1 or pGL2- NF\u03baB luciferase reporter vector and a pCDNA3.1/MEKK1 expression vector or pCDNA3.1 empty vector. (D) CCL5 reporter assay analysis showing effect of chemical inhibitors on CCL5 reporter activity. Cells were treated for six hours prior to lysis with the following drugs concentrations: (MEK inhibitor, 10 ng/ml, n = 3), CAY10512 (NF\u03baB inhibitor, 1.3 \u03bcg/ml, n = 3), and PEITC (0.3 \u03bcM, n = 3). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 by t-test.To determine how MEKK1 kinase activity regulates CCL5 transcription, we first confirmed the effect of MEKK1 on activation of the AP-1 and NF\u03baB transcription factors. We observed that co-expression of MEKK1 significantly enhanced activity of gene reporters driven by either AP-1 or NF\u03baB response elements ( Figure 4C ). We then sought to elucidate which MEKK1-dependent signaling pathway induces CCL5 expression by including chemical inhibitors of either NF\u03baB or AP-1 transcription in our reporter experiments. We observed that blockade of NF\u03baB by the inhibitor CAY10512 resulted in a 60% reduction in CCL5 reporter activity (p=0.037) ( Figure 4D ), whereas inhibition of ERK activation by MEK blocker U0126 reduced CCL5 reporter activity by 35% (p=0.068). Selective MEKK1 inhibitors have not yet been reported, so to determine whether chemical inhibition of MEKK1 blocks CCL5 reporter activity, we treated transfected fibroblasts with phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a naturally occurring compound that has been reported to display some inhibitory activity toward MEKK1. We observed that exposure to PEITC consistently, albeit not significantly (p=0.08) reduced CCL5 reporter activity by 24%. These results support the conclusion that MEKK1 kinase activity promotes activation of transcription factors that drive CCL5 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that signaling arising from MEKK1 kinase activity promotes induction of CCL5 expression in mammary fibroblasts, whereas MEKK1 ubiquitin ligase activity is dispensable for CCL5 induction.CCR5 Inhibitor Maraviroc Blocks Mammary Fibroblast-Induced Breast Cancer Cell ChemotaxisGiven that MEKK1-deficient fibroblasts showed both reduced CCL5 expression ( Figures 2  and  4 ) and diminished ability to induce tumor cell invasion ( Figure 1 ), we decided to examine the importance of breast stroma-derived CCL5 in MDA-MB 231 tumor cell migration. Several MEKK1-dependent chemokines are CCR5 ligands, and recent reports suggest that CCR5 function may be important in breast cancer metastasis. To determine whether CCR5 blockade would inhibit tumor cell migration, we performed chemotaxis assays in the presence of Maraviroc, which is a selective and non-competitive CCR5 antagonist that blocks ligand binding and subsequent signaling. We observed that exposure to Maraviroc reduces MDA-MB 231 chemotaxis induced by mammary fibroblast-conditioned media by 50% ( Figure 5 ), thus indicating that CCR5 function contributes to tumor cell chemotaxis induced by mammary fibroblasts. When considered with our expression data, these results demonstrate that MEKK1 strongly enhances the ability of mammary fibroblasts to produce chemoattractant proteins that are detected by breast tumor cells. Furthermore, our findings suggest that MEKK1 is a key regulator of CCL5 expression. Once released by mammary fibroblasts, MEKK1-dependent chemokine expression would be predicted to drive migration of CCR5-expressing cells in the breast tumor microenvironment.Mammary fibroblast-induced breast tumor cell migration is blocked by CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc. Graph shows results from Boyden chamber assays of MDA-MB231 cell chemotaxis. Mammary fibroblast-conditioned media was used as a chemoattractant and includes either Maraviroc (10\u00b5M) or an equal volume of vehicle. The data represented in graphs are derived from at least three independent experiments. *p < 0.05 against control by t-test.Breast Tumor Cell-Derived FGF-5 Induces CCL5 Expression in Mammary FibroblastsBreast tumor cells have been reported to secrete multiple factors that may activate mammary fibroblast signaling. To identify tumor cell-derived secreted factors that induce MEKK1-dependent CCL5 expression, we performed expression analysis of mRNA extracted from MDA-MB 231 cells (three replicates) and observed that of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of secreted factors, FGF-5 alone was highly expressed ( Figure 6A ). FGF-5 is a ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR1, and although FGFR1 ligation initiates cell signaling that regulates cell function, our investigation did not reveal any published study linking FGF-5 activation to MEKK1. Active MEKK1 phosphorylates and activates kinases of the MEK family that subsequently phosphorylate the activation loop of JNK and ERK1/2 MAPKs, so we utilized immunoblot analysis with phospho-specific ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) and JNK (T183/Y185) antibodies to determine whether FGF-5 activates MAPK signaling. We observed that exposure to recombinant FGF-5 had little effect on JNK phosphorylation (not shown), but consistently induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was reversed by the MEKK1 inhibitor PEITC ( Figure 6B ). Finally, we determined whether FGF-5-induced signaling induces CCL5 expression by performing CCL5 reporter assays in mammary fibroblasts treated with recombinant FGF-5. Since we had found that CCL5 expression was sensitive to inhibition of NF\u03baB and AP-1, we also performed reporter assays to determine whether FGF-5 promotes activation of these CCL5-regulating transcription factors. As predicted, we found that FGF-5 significantly (53%) activated NF\u03baB reporter activity, and consistently activated both the CCL5 (30%) and AP-1 (16%) reporter assays ( Figure 6C ). Finally, we examined the importance of tumor-derived FGF-5 to CCL5 expression in mammary fibroblasts. FGF-5 is a ligand for FGFR1 and FGFR2, and to determine whether inhibition of FGFR1 activation alone was responsible for CCL5 reporter activity induced in mammary fibroblasts by tumor-derived factors, we pre-treated mammary fibroblasts with the selective FGFR1 inhibitor SSR128129E prior to stimulation with breast cancer cell-conditioned media ( Figure 6D ). We observed only a modest partial inhibition of CCL5 reporter activity, suggesting that FGFR1-independent signaling plays a major role in tumor cell-induced CCL5 expression in mammary fibroblasts.Breast tumor cell-derived FGF-5 activates MEKK1 in mammary fibroblasts.

One possible mechanism driving cancer cell expansion into surrounding tissues and distant organs would be for cancer cells to migrate toward a source of chemoattractant, such as organs or tissue environments that produce migration-inducing chemoattractants. Soluble chemoattractants such as chemokines drive directed cell migration, and breast cancer cells that express chemokine receptors can migrate in the direction of increasing concentrations of cognate chemokine ligands present in the tumor microenvironment. The chemokine ligand CCL5/RANTES drives directed migration of cells that express the chemokine receptors activated by CCL5, including the cell surface receptor CCR5. While the importance of CCL5 in driving leukocyte migration has long been known, CCL5 may well induce chemotaxis in other cells that similarly express one or more of the CCL5 receptors.Our data would suggest that MEKK1 is an important regulator of chemokine expression in fibroblasts within the breast stroma tissue that serve as a major source of chemokines that induce chemotaxis of cancer cells ( Figure 7 ), possibly contributing to cancer cell migration to distant tissues and organs from the primary tumor. It is important to note that our model represents a part of a very complex cellular system, and does not exclude the possibility that other stroma cell types may contribute to the overall protein concentration of stroma-derived CCL5 within tumors. We recognize that breast cancer cells may produce secreted factors other than FGF-5 that induce expression of CCL5. Furthermore, fibroblasts and other stroma cells localized in additional non-tumor tissues could release chemokines that provide a chemoattractant stimulus for breast tumor cells to localize to those tissue, thereby providing a means by which breast tumor cells home to the sites of secondary tumor formation and eventual metastases.Model of MEKK1-Ccl5 expression induced by paracrine interaction between breast cancer cells and mammary stroma. MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells express and secrete FGF-5 in the tumor microenvironment, inducing expression of mammary fibroblast-derived CCL5 that promotes tumor cell migration. FGF-5 binds to FGFR1 proteins on the surface of mammary fibroblasts, triggering receptor tyrosine kinase activity that induces MEKK1 activation and signaling that leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors, binding of an active transcriptional complex to the CCL5 promoter and CCL5 expression.CCR5 function is well described in leukocytes such as lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages. CCR5 binding to chemokine ligands secreted at sites of inflammation contributes to the ability of leukocytes to detect and migrate to inflamed tissues in order to promote a functional immune response. While it is an important component a functional immune system, CCR5 also represents an avenue by which the immune system is compromised by viral infection. HIV utilizes CCR5 to bind and infect target lymphocytes, and discovery of the HIV-CCR5 interaction led to the development of Maraviroc as an FDA-approved HIV therapeutic agent. It is reasonable to postulate that nonimmune cells that express CCR5 may migrate in response to a concentration gradient of CCL5, and thus investigation of CCR5 blockers as breast cancer therapeutic agents is in its early stages, and is bolstered by data from animal models of tumor progression showing promise as anti-metastasis agents. We recognize that, as our data identify MEKK1 as a regulator of multiple chemokines, selective MEKK1 inhibition may have functional consequences that far exceed the impact of CCR5 inhibition alone (e.g. immune function) that will influence the utility of MEKK1 inhibitors as cancer therapeutic agents. We have chosen to focus our functional assays on CCL5 in part because of the availability of Maraviroc as an FDA-approved HIV therapeutic that we would propose may have the potential to be repurposed for cancer treatment. We realize that much work remains to be done to investigate the importance of the other MEKK1-dependent chemokines identified in this study.In this study, we have found that mammary fibroblasts express chemokines that promote immune cell directed migration. We demonstrated that CCL5 expression is strongly promoted by MEKK1 kinase activity, and that ablation of MEKK1 kinase activity, either via gene knockout, chemical inhibition of MEKK1, or transfection of dominant negative MEKK1, greatly reduces CCL5 expression. We previously reported that MEKK1 signaling is required for expression of proteases that are transcriptionally controlled by AP-1 and promote tumor invasiveness, so our discovery that MEKK1 controls chemokine gene expression in breast stroma cells strongly supports a model of the breast tumor microenvironment in which MEKK1-dependent gene expression in stroma cells can promote breast cancer cell migration. When combined with our previous reports, a paradigm emerges wherein MEKK1 controls gene expression in both malignant cancer cells and non-cancer stroma cells, and MEKK1-dependent genes in both cell types promote invasion and metastasis.MEKK1 belongs to a family (MAP3K) of more than twenty different protein kinases, with many exhibiting similar substrate preferences. For example, six of these kinases can activate ERK1/2 signaling, whereas at least fourteen drive JNK activation. We maintain that one evolutionary explanation for the abundance of MAPK regulators may be that many cellular functions require carefully modulated MAPK activity, and that response to distinct signals by different MAP3K proteins promotes specific functional outcomes. If several related proteins have similar MAPK regulatory capabilities, why is MEKK1 essential to CCL5 expression? One function that distinguishes MEKK1 from some other MAP3K is that it can activate IKB kinases to promote NF\u03baB activity. Combined with the capacity to control AP-1 activity by promoting both MAPK signaling and ubiquitin ligase activity, MEKK1 has the unique capacity to serve as a transcriptional regulator of both AP-1 and NF\u03baB-dependent gene expression. Why does ablation of MEKK1 result in a marked reduction of CCL5 expression? We propose that the ability of MEKK1 to integrate signals arising from environmental stimuli that activate both AP-1 and NF\u03baB activity may be necessary for expression of genes like CCL5 that require both NF\u03baB and MEKK1-dependent AP-1 transcriptional complexes.ConclusionsIn conclusion, we provide evidence that MEKK1-dependent CCL5 expression in mammary fibroblasts can induce a functional response in breast tumor cells that is a key requirement for breast tumor metastasis to occur. When considering our previous reports that MEKK1 regulating breast tumor cell function, and that MEKK1-deficient mice are significantly protected from breast tumor metastasis, we conclude that MEKK1 activity in both malignant breast cancer cells and non-cancer stroma cells drive the creation of a breast tumor environment that favors metastasis. Chemokines have been proposed to be potential breast cancer therapeutic targets, and our work provides evidence to support the contention that pharmacologic inhibition of MEKK1 may be one approach to reduce expression of chemokines and thereby alter the tumor microenvironment that promotes metastasis. At present, we would postulate that CCR5 competitive inhibitors such as Maraviroc should be investigated in future translational research as potential anti-metastasis therapeutics.Data Availability StatementThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

However, recently, clinical and experimental evidence have revealed that tumor development is intimately related to the complex interactions that transpire within the tumor microenvironment. Neoplastic epithelial cells engage in reciprocal molecular dialogues with surrounding stromal cells, including inflammatory cells, vascular cells and fibroblasts, resulting in the production of stromal-derived tumor-aiding factors, such as growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, proteases, and vascular-stimulating factors. These molecular communications at the site of the primary tumor enable its growth and dissemination.Breast cancer represents one example of a carcinoma in which the collaborative efforts from malignant epithelial cells and stromal cells within the primary tumor coordinate carcinogenesis, and ultimately, metastasis to distant organs. Women have a 12% risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetimes, and a 5% risk of breast carcinoma-related death. Mortality results from frequent metastasis, which reduces long-term survival (+5 years) from approximately 90% to 5%. A xenograft model of breast cancer has shown that breast carcinoma cells depend on stromal cells to metastasize. This may be explained by the finding that the stroma plays a paramount role in supporting breast tumor growth and vascularization, both of which are prerequisite to metastasis. Because of the importance of the tumor/stromal interactions in promoting breast cancer metastasis, it is imperative to elucidate the molecular events that occur between cancer cells and adjacent stroma at the site of the primary tumor.Of particular interest are the stromal fibroblasts found within mammary carcinomas, which by volume constitute the major cellular component of the tumor microenvironment. Termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), these cells have been connected to several tumor-promoting events, including: angiogenesis, anti-tumor immunosuppression, genetic instability, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. Although the importance of these cells in tumor progression has been acknowledged, CAFs have not been clearly and universally defined, and are only roughly characterized by their enhanced production of tumor-promoting factors.Similar to the way in which a tumor is equated to a \u201cwound that never heals\u201d, CAFs have been compared to \u201cactivated fibroblasts\u201d or myofibroblasts, which are present in inflammatory environments, where they play a critical role in angiogenesis and the production of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Several studies suggest that myofibroblasts constitute the majority of CAFs, as determined by alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), a marker for differentiated myofibroblasts. In contrast, other data suggest that not all CAFs within the tumor microenvironment are myofibroblasts. For example, Holliday and colleagues established that only 35% of CAFs isolated from primary breast carcinomas were \u03b1SMA-positive, and that this mirrored the expression of \u03b1SMA in normal breast fibroblasts. Yet other studies characterize CAFs by elevated stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) expression. Sugimoto and colleagues demonstrate that the expression of commonly used \u201cCAF-markers\u201d, including \u03b1SMA, vimentin, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) do not overlap with each other. Thus, they conclude that CAFs are a heterogeneous population and that the use of these markers alone will not suffice to identify all CAFs. We speculate, therefore, that multiple CAF subpopulations exist and suggest that they evolve from a variety of origins.Indeed, Orimo and Weinberg have proposed three models by which CAFs are derived in human carcinomas: clonal selection of a group of fibroblasts or progenitors that have acquired genetic alterations; transdifferentiation of normal stromal fibroblasts, without acquiring genetic alterations; and differentiation of stromal fibroblasts recruited from specialized progenitor cells in circulation. Studies support the notion that CAFs are either derived from bone marrow progenitor cells and/or that they evolve from the conversion of normal mammary fibroblasts or other resident cells, such as endothelial cells or epithelial cancer cells.We are interested in the mechanism(s) by which breast cancer cells solicit normal, human resident mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) to produce inflammatory and tumor-promoting factors, and thus become activated and CAF-like, and/or mature CAFs. Little is known about the molecular determinants of the transformation of an HMF to a CAF. In the current study, we examined the transdifferentiation of primary normal resident HMFs to activated fibroblasts, or to acquire CAF-like phenotype, in response to breast cancer secreted factors. We measured factors that have previously been affiliated with CAFs and/or the activated fibroblasts found in sites of inflammation. Our data demonstrate that SUM102 breast cancer cells, which were derived from an intraductal breast carcinoma, secrete factors that stimulate normal HMFs to express tumor-enhancing, inflammatory-related factors, including matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and the G-protein coupled receptor, CXCR4.The neutral protease, MMP-1, is recognized as a critical factor in breast cancer metastasis, and its roles as a mediator of matrix degradation and as a modulator of cell behavior have been established. However, no study has examined MMP-1 expression and function during the transition from an HMF to a CAF, nor has the function of this protease been identified in CAF isolates from breast cancer patients, although it has been associated with matrix remodeling by activated fibroblasts in inflammation.The overexpression of chemokines and their receptors, such as CXCR4, is also well documented as a key stimulus in promoting breast cancer tumorigenesis. Classically, CXCR4 is markedly upregulated on breast cancer cells, allowing them to migrate to targeted distant organs containing cells that secrete its ligand, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1). However, it has also been documented that CXCR4 expression is elevated in fibroblasts in inflammatory environments other than cancer. For example, synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis display constitutively expressed CXCR4 mRNA and cell surface protein. Similarly, studies show that fibroblasts from mice with pulmonary fibrosis express CXCR4 and respond chemotactically to SDF-1. Because the cancer microenvironment has been equated to a chronic site of inflammation, we propose that like activated fibroblasts in inflammatory conditions, CAFs also increase CXCR4 levels and that this contributes to breast cancer progression.Our study illustrates that MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels are increased in primary HMFs treated with factors secreted by breast cancer cells, and that MMP-1 and CXCR4 are functionally important for downstream signaling, cell migration, and matrix degradation. Notably, we use normal, primary HMFs in these studies to avoid potential artifacts, such as a spontaneous increase in CXCR4 following immortalization with telomerase. Importantly, we also demonstrate increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression and function in CAF isolates from primary breast tumors, compared to counterpart, non-tumor-associated fibroblasts from the same patient, signifying that our findings are clinically relevant. Together, our data suggest that breast cancer cells secrete growth factors and chemokines that stimulate normal resident HMFs to become CAF-like.RESULTSHuman mammary fibroblasts promote tumor engraftment and growth of 102 breast cancer cellsSUM102 (102) breast cancer cells were derived from an intraductal breast carcinoma and are ER-/PR-, suggesting that they are phenotypically aggressive. Since MMP-1 and CXCR4 mediate breast cancer invasion and metastasis by MDA-MB 231 (231) breast cancer cells in vivo, we compared MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression in 102 breast cancer cells to that of the well-established, aggressive 231 breast cancer cells. Compared to 102 cells, MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA was greater in 231 cells by approximately 35-fold and 70-fold, respectively (Figure 1A), indicating that the 102 cells do not express the same parameters as the 231 cells. Unlike 231 cells, which readily form tumors in vivo, when 102 cells were injected orthotopically into the 4th mammary fat pad of nude mice, they were weakly tumorigenic (Figure 1B), suggesting that tumorigenesis in these cells may depend on stromal/tumor cell interactions.Reports have documented that either non-cancer associated, normal human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) or carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) enhance breast tumor growth when injected simultaneously with mammary carcinoma cells into nude mice using an orthotopic model. We used this model to examine the functional ramifications of the molecular interactions between weakly tumorigenic 102 breast cancer cells and HMFs isolated from cancer free mammary tissues: 102 breast cancer cells were injected orthotopically into nude mice in the presence or absence of HMFs (Figure 1B). After 6 months, 100% of mice with concomitant injections of 102 breast cancer cells and HMFs developed tumors, while only ~33% of mice injected with 102 cells alone displayed tumors of modest size (~5mm) (P=0.0027) (Table 1). Moreover, when 102 breast cancer cells were co-injected with HMFs, larger tumors (~10mm) formed than when 102 cells were injected alone (***P=0.0006) (Figure 1B and Table 1). Cell number could not explain this finding, since twice as many 102 cells were injected into mice receiving only the tumor cells. Further, mice injected with HMFs alone yielded no tumors (Figure 1B and Table 1). Thus, we conclude that tumor formation and growth are augmented when mice were co-injected with 102 cells and HMFs, suggesting that 102 breast cancer progression is enhanced by the presence of human mammary fibroblasts. Soluble factors secreted by breast cancer cells up-regulate specific tumor-enhancing genes in nearby fibroblasts. We hypothesized therefore, that the weakly tumorigenic 102 breast cancer cells secrete soluble factors that aid in the transdifferentiation of resident mammary fibroblasts to tumor-promoting, activated fibroblasts, that are CAFs or CAF-like, and that subsequently, these activated stromal cells up-regulate inflammatory mediators that facilitate tumor progression.102 breast cancer cells stimulate the expression of tumor-promoting genes that are associated with cancer and inflammation in normal mammary fibroblastsTo determine whether factors produced by 102 carcinoma cells affect HMF gene expression, causing these stromal cells to gain an activated, CAF-like phenotype, we used real-time RT-PCR to measure the expression of a panel of genes known to be associated with CAFs and/or activated fibroblasts. Compared to control HMFs, treated with HMF cell conditioned media (HMFCM), HMFs treated with 102 cell conditioned media (102CM) exhibited significantly increased levels of several genes that have been previously associated with activated fibroblasts present in inflammatory situations and CAFs: MMP-1, MMP-3, IL-8, and SDF-1 (Figure 2A). Notably, these genes also promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis. As expected when studying primary cells from an out-bred population, we observed inherent differences in the responsiveness of HMFs treated with 102CM. Nonetheless, of the 12 primary HMF samples tested, ~70% were responsive.These data suggest that HMFs become activated or CAF-like in response to 102CM, and thus acquire an enhanced tumor-promoting phenotype following exposure to soluble breast cancer factors. However, 102CM did not induce other genes, including several classic CAF-related genes: FAP, \u03b1SMA, vimentin, and VEGF within 24h (data not shown). This finding suggests that resident HMFs, which become activated and CAF-like, may represent a distinct sub-population of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. It is also feasible that HMFs may require additional environmental cues, which are absent in vitro, in order to transform into mature CAFs. Alternatively, other studies have shown that fibroblast precursor cells only express CAF-related genes, such SDF-1, \u03b1SMA and FAP, after 30 days of exposure to breast cancer CM.Perhaps most interestingly, we found that HMFs exhibited elevated CXCR4 mRNA levels in response to 102CM (Figure 2B), since overexpression of this receptor is usually associated with invasive breast cancer cells (see Figure 1A), while CAFs are recognized for secreting increased amounts of its ligand, SDF-1. As noted earlier, we also detected SDF-1 gene induction in HMFs exposed to 102CM (see Figure 2A). Elevated CXCR4 expression on breast cancer cells has been correlated with augmented angiogenesis and directional migration. Thus, CXCR4 induction in resident fibroblasts implies that these cells may also contribute to tumorigenesis, invasion and migration. We conclude that 102CM induces the expression of genes associated with activated fibroblasts and/or CAFs, and we will focus on MMP-1 and CXCR4 because of their documented importance in breast cancer progression. To emphasize the broad significance of this finding, media conditioned by 231 breast cancer cells, or their lung metastatic derivative, LM2 cells, also induced MMP-1 (top panels) and CXCR4 (bottom panels) mRNA in HMFs within 24h (Figure 2C). Due to the low levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 in the 102 cells, compared to those in the aggressive 231 cells (see Figure 1A) and LM2 cells (data not shown), the 102 cells represent a stronger model for examining the functional contribution of stromal-derived MMP-1 and CXCR4 in breast cancer progression. Thus, we focus on the effects made by 102 breast cancer cells on surrounding fibroblasts.Time course of MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels in HMFs exposed to soluble 102 breast cancer factorsTo define the time course of MMP-1 and CXCR4 induction in HMFs, mRNA was measured following treatment of these cells with 102CM or control HMFCM. Both MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA in HMFs increased steadily from 3h to 24h of exposure to 102CM (Figure 3A), while levels of these mRNAs were unchanged in HMFs treated with control media, HMFCM. Both MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression returned to original levels within 3h upon removal of the breast cancer cell CM (data not shown). Depending on the HMF sample, the relative fold change in CXCR4 between 102CM-treated HMFs and control HMFs ranged from 10-fold to over 50-fold, while fold change in MMP-1 induction ranged from 2-fold to 10-fold (data not shown).Western blot analysis confirmed that protein levels correlated with gene induction. Neither HMFCM, nor 102CM alone generated measurable levels of latent or active MMP-1 (Figure 3B, left panel), confirming that basal MMP-1 levels in HMFs and 102 cells are low. However, 102CM triggered the secretion of both latent and active MMP-1 in HMFs, compared to HMFs treated with control media, HMFCM (Figure 3B, right panel). Bands larger than 52kDa in the CM represent glycosylated MMP-1. Similarly, high levels of CXCR4 protein were detected in HMFs treated with 102CM after 12h, while little CXCR4 was detected in HMFs treated with HMFCM (Figure 3C). HMF-derived CXCR4 protein diminished by 24h of treatment with 102CM (Figure 3C), possibly due to the increase in SDF-1 mRNA (Figure 3D), which typically ranged from 2- to 10-fold (data not shown). Indeed, the kinetic profile of SDF-1 is such that if SDF-1 levels begin to increase at 16h, it is possible that this chemokine is generated and binds CXCR4, causing internalization and degradation of this receptor by 24h ( and see Discussion). Media conditioned by 231 and LM2 breast cancer cells also induced MMP-1 and CXCR4 protein levels in HMFs within 24h (data not shown).Functional significance of increased stromal MMP-1 in the absence of breast cancer cell-derived MMP-1To demonstrate the functional importance of MMP-1 in HMFs, we used an in vitro collagen degradation assay, in which HMFs were embedded in a collagen gel and incubated with control HMFCM or 102CM. Immunohistochemistry detected MMP-1 protein produced by HMFs embedded in a collagen matrix when subjected to either HMFCM or 102CM for 6h (Figure 4A). While HMFs treated with 102CM stained positively for MMP-1, only a few cells treated with HMFCM were partially stained (see arrows), despite the equal number of cells per gel. Furthermore, collagen surrounding HMFs treated with 102CM displayed punctate MMP-1 staining throughout, indicating that these cells actively secreted MMP-1. In contrast, MMP-1 was not present in HMF-embedded gels treated with HMFCM.While very little degradation resulted when collagen-embedded HMFs were treated with HMFCM for 48h, collagen degradation by HMFs treated with 102CM was extensive, as measured by the amount of media liberated from the collagen as it was degraded (***P<0.0001) (Figure 4B). The negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. To confirm MMP-1 as the agent responsible for the collagen degradation, an MMP-1 neutralizing antibody was added to the collagen, and HMF-driven degradation of collagen was prevented (Figure 4C). Similarly, addition of a general MMP inhibitor, Ilomastat, abrogated collagen degradation (*P<0.05) (Figure 4C). Again, the negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. These data imply that weakly invasive 102 breast cancer cells, which do not produce MMP-1 (Figure 3B), can exploit nearby fibroblasts to produce MMP-1, resulting in the degradation of surrounding ECM.CXCR4 on HMFs stimulates downstream signaling and allows cells to migrate in response to exogenous SDF-1It has been demonstrated that cell-surface CXCR4 may be present on cells, but unresponsive to SDF-1 stimulation, as measured by downstream signaling. Since SDF-1 is the only known ligand for CXCR4, we determined whether SDF-1 successfully signaled through HMF CXCR4 by measuring the activation of p44/42 (Erk1/2), a component of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Addition of SDF-1 to HMFs for 5 minutes stimulated the phosphorylation of p44/42, indicating the activation of this pathway (Figure 5A, left panel). To confirm SDF-1 signaling through activation of CXCR4, cells were pretreated with a CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100, and subsequently treated with SDF-1 for 0 or 5 minutes. Inhibition of CXCR4 blunted p44/42 phosphorylation by SDF-1 (Figure 5A, right panel), allowing us to conclude that upon binding to CXCR4, SDF-1 stimulates downstream signal transduction in HMFs. The partial inhibition observed with AMD3100 most likely reflects the fact that this MAPK pathway is activated by other mechanisms in these cells ( and data not shown).Standard chemotaxis assays were conducted to investigate the downstream function of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling axis in HMFs stimulated with HMFCM or 102CM. These functional experiments also confirm that the increased total CXCR4 protein observed by western blot analysis results in increased surface CXCR4. Figure 5B represents a qualitative analysis of these results, which are quantified in Figure 5C. As expected, HMFs migrated toward FBS (positive control), but not toward BSA (negative vehicle control). Although HMFs treated with control HMFCM failed to migrate toward SDF-1, HMFs exposed to 102CM, and which therefore have increased CXCR4 levels (see Figure 3), migrated readily toward SDF-1 (***P=0.0001) (Figure 5B and C). To corroborate CXCR4 as the key mediator in HMF migration toward SDF-1, the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, was used to block CXCR4 signaling. Blocking CXCR4 reduced HMF migration toward SDF-1 by ~2\u20133 fold, as is evident in Figure 5B and C (***P=0.0016). Taken together, these data confirm that breast cancer cells secrete factors that not only induce CXCR4 protein levels in HMFs, but also that this receptor responds to its ligand by transmitting downstream signals and enhancing migration.MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein are increased in primary CAFs compared to their counterpart fibroblasts and HMFsTo ascertain whether our observations were clinically relevant, we investigated MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression and function in CAFs isolated from primary human breast tumors, their respective (non-cancer-associated) counterpart fibroblasts (CPFs), and age-matched, HMFs from patients without cancer (Figure 6A). Basal MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA levels in CPFs were similar to those in normal, unstimulated HMFs, suggesting that non-tumor associated fibroblasts collected from patients with breast cancer have comparable MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression to those observed in HMFs taken from patients not afflicted with cancer. In contrast, basal expression of these genes was significantly higher in CAFs, demonstrating that clinically derived CAFs have constitutively increased levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA (*P<0.05) (Figure 6A). 102CM further stimulated MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA levels in HMFs, CPFs, and CAFs, suggesting that regardless of cell type, soluble factors from breast cancer cells stimulate the expression of these tumor-promoting genes (Figure 6A). To confirm their status as CAFs, we examined these cells for increased expression of a CAF-recognized gene, FAP, and found it to be elevated compared to FAP mRNA in CPFs (data not shown).Constitutive MMP-1 (top panel) and CXCR4 (bottom panel) protein levels were also increased in CAFs compared to HMFs and CPFs (Figure 6B). The multiple banding pattern for both MMP-1 and CXCR4 protein results from glycosylation. Flow cytometry detected increased CXCR4 surface expression on ~1.0% of CAFs, compared to ~0.1% of HMFs (Figure 6C). The percentage of cells expressing CXCR4 over time is likely higher than the values obtained, because CXCR4 is rapidly internalized, making it difficult to detect. Importantly, flow cytometry revealed that 10-fold more CAFs express CXCR4 than HMFs, and of these cells, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CAFs was consistently greater than the MFI of HMFs (data not shown). Because CXCR4 is rapidly internalized, this method of determining CXCR4 surface expression may be less definitive than a functional assay (see below).Migratory and invasive capabilities are increased in primary CAFs compared to their counterpart fibroblasts and HMFsTo measure the functionality of CAF-derived MMP-1, we assessed the ability of these cells to degrade collagen in the collagen degradation assay. HMFs and CPFs treated with naive, serum-free medium did not degrade the type I collagen. In contrast, CAFs readily degraded the collagen matrix, except when MMP-1 was neutralized with an antibody (Figure 7A). The negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. These findings confirm and expand on previous studies, demonstrating that CAFs derived from clinical specimens not only maintain increased MMP-1 levels, but also that this fibroblast-derived enzyme degrades surrounding matrix, suggesting a role for these cells in vivo.To investigate whether CAF-expressed CXCR4 promoted chemotaxis toward SDF-1, these cells were examined in a standard migration assay. CAFs migrated readily toward SDF-1, while CPFs and HMFs did not (**P<0.001) (Figure 7B), and that the degree of migration corresponded with the relative levels of CXCR4 in these cells. Each of the primary cell lines migrated toward 10% FBS, the positive control, but were not attracted toward the negative vehicle control, 0.1% BSA (Figure 7B). Importantly, blocking CXCR4 function with AMD3100 abrogated CAF migration (***P=0.001) (Figure 7C), indicating that CAF-derived CXCR4 is necessary for the migration toward SDF-1 and demonstrating that CXCR4 expressed on these cells is functional.Thus, we conclude that CAF specimens derived from clinical material express increased MMP-1 and CXCR4, which potentiate the invasive and migratory phenotype of these cells. These results validate the clinical relevancy of our findings with HMFs treated with 102CM, since HMFs treated with 102CM share characteristics with CAFs obtained from patient specimens. Further, the data support the concept that inflammatory factors provided by breast cancer cells may initiate the HMF-to-CAF transdifferentiation.DISCUSSIONSome CAFs have been compared to the activated fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, present in sites of wound healing and chronic inflammation. Myofibroblasts at sites of inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression, which facilitate cellular invasion and migration. Taken together, these observations support our hypothesis that MMP-1 and CXCR4 may also be elevated in fibroblasts that are found within the breast tumor microenvironment and suggest that these factors are induced as an HMF becomes more activated and CAF-like.In this report, we provide evidence to support this hypothesis. First, our data show that SUM102 breast cancer cells, which express low levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4, require mammary fibroblasts to grow in vivo (Figure 1). Second, the SUM102 cells secrete factors that stimulate the expression of several inflammatory factors, including MMP-1 and CXCR4, in adjacent stromal cells (Figures 1 and 2). This suggests that 102 breast cancer cells may solicit normal, resident HMFs to facilitate tumor growth in vivo. Further, increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 enhanced the invasive and migratory behavior of HMFs, verifying functional contributions of these cells to tumor progression (Figures 4 and 5). Finally, we validated these findings by demonstrating that mammary CAF isolates from patients with breast cancer have amplified basal MMP-1 and CXCR4 levels, which augment their invasive and migratory potential, respectively (Figures 6 and 7). In vivo, this phenotype may permit CAFs to degrade matrix as they migrate within the tumor microenvironment. Our findings emphasize the possible clinical relevance of MMP-1 and CXCR4 induction in CAFs, and demonstrate that normal HMFs exposed to soluble breast cancer factors acquire phenotypic characteristics shared with CAF specimens (Figures 6 and 7), indicating that breast cancer cells may initiate the conversion of resident HMFs to CAFs.The process of matrix invasion by malignant cells requires both degradation of the matrix and cellular migration. Studies conducted previously in our laboratory demonstrated that MMP-1 derived from breast cancer cells is necessary for tumor growth and invasion at the primary site. Since MMP-1 is secreted, it is reasonable to propose that stromal-derived MMP-1 functions similarly to that produced by the breast cancer cells. Furthermore, not all breast cancer cells produce MMP-1, increasing the importance of CAF-derived MMP-1 in tumor progression.CXCR4 up-regulation is most commonly linked to breast cancer epithelial cells; on the other hand, the ligand for CXCR4, SDF-1, has been classified as CAF-related. In this report, we have identified CXCR4 as a novel CAF-associated gene. This finding, coupled with the discovery that CAFs express increased levels of SDF-1, imply that an autocrine feedback loop may exist. It is possible that SDF-1 produced by CAFs binds to and signals through, CAF CXCR4, potentially causing important downstream effects. Specifically, the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling axis results in a multitude of cellular functions: migration, homing, adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and the induction of MMPs. For example, SDF-1 signaling through CXCR4 on the activated fibroblasts in patients with rheumatoid arthritis results in their activation, migration and proliferation. Several breast cancer cell lines also secrete SDF-1; thus, it is feasible that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis functions not only in an autocrine manner, but also in paracrine fashion within the tumor microenvironment, where SDF-1 produced by tumor cells binds to CXCR4 on surrounding CAFs and vice-versa.Breast cancer cells over-expressing CXCR4 home to organs constitutively expressing SDF-1, such as the lungs, liver and bone, yet the in vivo function of CXCR4 on CAFs is currently unknown. Nonetheless, the in vivo function of CXCR4 on fibroblasts in other inflammatory diseases has been well documented and cancers have been likened to a wound that does not heal. For example, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibroblast precursor cells expressing CXCR4 have been shown to home to the lungs, which express elevated levels of SDF-1, thereby indicating that activated fibroblasts have the ability to migrate in vivo. Since we show that CXCR4 on CAFs is functional and that these cells are endowed with the ability to migrate towards SDF-1, we speculate that CAFs may migrate throughout the microenvironment of the primary tumor, degrading collagen through the secretion of MMP-1.A comprehensive list of CAF marker designations has not been definitively established. Instead, these cells have been associated with a variety of markers. Because CAFs may arise from various sources, it is not surprising that these cells could express different markers, and as a result, contribute to carcinogenesis differently. We did not observe increased levels of FAP, vimentin, and \u03b1SMA in HMFs exposed to soluble breast cancer factors. However, we document that normal HMFs increase several other CAF-related genes (see Figure 2A), including IL-8, SDF-1, MMP-3 and MMP-1. In addition, we demonstrated increased CXCR4 in CAFs and in HMFs in response to factors secreted by 102 breast cancer cells, a factor which has not previously been associated with CAFs. Since MMP-1 and CXCR4 are elevated in CAF isolates from the clinic, we suggest that the induction of specific genes by 102CM may represent an early transition phase of an HMF into a CAF and that these gene products facilitate breast cancer cell invasion and dissemination. Additionally, perhaps the high constitutive levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 seen in the CAFs taken from patients have resulted from genetic alterations made within these cells.Despite reports documenting that normal HMFs or CAFs enhance tumor growth when injected simultaneously with mammary carcinoma cells into nude mice, it has also been proposed that normal HMFs can suppress breast tumor formation in vivo. Indeed, then, it would be reasonable to propose that early in tumor formation normal, resident mammary fibroblasts suppress tumor growth, but that following the breast cancer cell-induced transition of HMFs to CAFs, these cells enhance tumor pathogenesis. Alternatively, it is possible that HMFs require prolonged treatment with breast cancer cell CM. This concept coincides with data from Mishra and colleagues, who showed that fibroblast precursor cells become fully CAF-like (as determined by SDF-1, \u03b1SMA and FAP expression) after 30 days of exposure to breast cancer CM.In conclusion, we demonstrate that CAFs display amplified MMP-1 and CXCR4 and that normal HMFs acquire enhanced MMP-1 and CXCR4 levels in response to soluble breast cancer agents. Our data suggest that breast cancer cells may initiate the conversion of normal, resident HMFs to CAFs.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and cell cultureSUM102 breast cancer cells (Asterand, Detroit, MI) were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 2% FBS, 5\u03bcg/mL insulin, 10ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1ug/mL hydrocortisone, Hepes Buffer, 100U/mL penicillin and 100ug/mL streptomycin. MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Rockville, MD) and their lung metastatic derivative (LM2, a kind gift from Dr. Massague at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) 50/50 F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. Primary human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were isolated from women who had undergone reduction mammoplasty surgery (Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center) and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. All patients were enlisted in an IRB-approved protocol. Primary carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their respective counterpart fibroblasts (CPFs) (Asterand) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. All cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and in 5% CO2. All primary cells were used between passages 2 and 6.Breast tumorigenesis in vivoCells were suspended in 100\u03bcl of Matrigel\u00ae (BD Biosciences), and female mice (strain nu/nu, ~49 days old, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were injected orthotopically (4th mammary fat pad) with 2\u00d7106 SUM102 cells, 2\u00d7106 HMFs, or 1\u00d7106 of each cell line simultaneously. Eight mice were injected concomitantly with both cell lines, while six mice were injected with each cell line alone. Tumors were measured biweekly with calipers, and mice were sacrificed when tumor diameter exceeded 12mm, or at the termination of the study (6 months). The Dartmouth College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal studies.Generation of conditioned mediaTo condition media, cells were plated at 5\u00d7106 cells (102 breast cancer cells) or 1\u00d7106 (HMFs) per 150mm plate (~85% confluence) and left to seed for 24h in serum-containing media. The cells were then rinsed three times with Hank\u2019s Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and 15mL of serum-free Ham\u2019s F12 media, containing 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate (LH), were added per 150mm culture plate and conditioned for 24h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, media were transferred to a conical tube, centrifuged at 1500rpm for 5 minu tes to pellet cellular debris, and then decanted into a new conical tube. Conditioned media (CM) were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed for experiments, at which time the media were thawed and added directly to cells.Quantitative real-time RT-PCRTotal cellular RNA was purified using Qiagen\u2019s RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Total cellular RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan Reverse Transcriptase reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as directed by the manufacturer. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using 250ng of input RNA per reaction, as described. Data were averaged and normalized to the housekeeping gene, hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). mRNA values were calculated using 2\u2212(\u0394\u0394C(t)) and are presented as fold change compared to control conditions. Primer sequences were: CXCR4: 5\u2032-TGGGTGGTTGTGTTCCAGTTT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ATGCAATAGCAGGACAGGATGA-3\u2032 (reverse); HPRT: 5\u2032-AGCTTGCTGGTGAAAAGGAC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CCAGATGTTTCCAAACTCAACTTGA-3\u2032 (reverse); IL-8: 5\u2032-CTCTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATT3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TATGCACTGACATCTAAGTTCTTTAGC-3\u2032 (reverse); MMP-1: 5\u2032-AGCTAGCTCAGGATGACATTGATG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GCCGATGGGCTGGACAG-3\u2032 (reverse); MMP-3: 5\u2032-TTCCGCCTGTCTCAAGATGATAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AAAGGACAAAGCAGGATCACAGTT-3\u2032 (reverse); SDF-1: 5\u2032-CACATGTTGAACCTCTTGTTTAAAAGC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AACGCCAAGGTCGTGGTCGTGCTG-3\u2032 (reverse). cDNAs were assayed in triplicate.In vitro collagen degradation assayThis assay was carried out as previously described. Briefly, neutralized collagen was mixed with equivalent volumes of cells to yield 5\u00d7105 cells/mL and 500\u03bcl of the collagen/cell mixture was added to each well of a 24-well plate. After the collagen solidified at 37\u00b0C (~15 minutes), 0.5mL of control HMF cell conditioned media (HMFCM) or 102 cell conditioned media (102CM) containing ~0.00003% trypsin to activate latent MMPs was added carefully to each well in the presence or absence of anti-FLAG antibody control (1\u03bcg/mL, Sigma), an MMP-1 neutralizing antibody (1\u03bcg/mL, Chemicon) or Illomastat (25\u03bcM, Chemicon). After 48h at 37\u00b0C, the overlying media were removed and weighed. The media released from a collagen gel were calculated by weighing the total media collected minus the original media added (0.5mL=0.5g). Samples were analyzed in triplicate and experiments were repeated at least three times. Assays stained for MMP-1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) were terminated at 6h, so that gels embedded with HMFs and treated with 102CM were not entirely degraded. Collagen gels were removed from wells with a rubber spatula, fixed in 1090 neutral buffered formaldehyde and processed for histological staining in the Pathology Department at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). Goat MMP-1 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was diluted to 1:100.Immunoblotting and antibodiesProteins from HMFs and 102 breast cancer cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. MMP-1 protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) from 1mL media, while CXCR4 was analyzed in whole cell lysates, which were suspended in 2x Laemmli lysis buffer (Sigma). Blots were probed with an MMP-1 antibody (Chemicon, Billerica, MA) diluted 1:2000, a CXCR4 anitbody (Chemicon) diluted 1:2000, phospho-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) diluted 1:1000, or actin antibodies (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) diluted 1:10,000. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:2000 in the appropriate blocking buffer.SDF-1/CXCR4 signalingHMFs were plated at 2.5\u00d7105 per 60 mm culture plate and allowed to seed overnight. After 24h, the cells were rinsed with HBSS and 102CM was added to all plates for 8h, after which time SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/ml, R&D Systems) was added for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, or 5 minutes and then cells were lysed in 150\u03bcl Laemmli buffer and prepared for immunoblotting for p44/42. Samples treated with AMD3100 (5\u03bcg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a small molecule inhibitor of CXCR4, were pretreated for 30 minutes, and then either vehicle control (0.1% BSA in 1X PBS) or SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/ml) was added for 5min.Migration assaysHMFs (5\u00d7104) were plated with media containing serum FluoroBlok\u2122 inserts (BD Falcon, 6.5mm, 8.0\u03bcm pore) as described previously, and allowed to seed overnight. The following morning, cells were rinsed with HBSS and treated with either HMFCM or 102CM. After 8h, DMEM containing 10% FBS (positive control), 0.1% BSA in PBS (negative vehicle control), or SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/mL) was added to the bottom chambers. Samples treated with AMD3100 (5\u03bcg/mL) were pretreated 30 minutes prior to adding attractants. Cells were permitted to migrate for approximately 18h, after which time the transwell inserts were exposed to the fluoroscent dye, Calcein AM (4\u03bcg/mL in HBSS, BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ), to visualize and count only cells that had migrated through the membrane. Migration assays with CAFs were conducted similarly, but rather than using FluoroBlok\u2122 inserts, standard transwell inserts (Corning, 6.5mm, 8.0\u03bcm pore) were used. To analyze migration with this method, transwell inserts were exposed to Calcein AM for 30 minutes, and then cells on the bottom were detached by incubating inserts in pre-warmed trypsin with agitation for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Medium containing 10% FBS was added to neutralize trypsin and pipetted to disperse cells evenly off the membrane. Cells were incubated for 3h and then were visualized by GFP fluorescence using excitation from a 100W Mercury lamp on an Olympus 1\u00d750 inverted phase contrast microscope and counted to quantify cell migration.Flow cytometryHMFs or CAFs were grown to confluence in 150mm plates and serum-starved overnight prior to being harvested for analysis of surface CXCR4 by flow cytometry. On the day of harvest, cells were rinsed with 1XPBS and incubated in acidic glycine buffer (0.05M glycine HCl buffer, pH 3, w/0.1M NaCl) for 1minute to ensure that stable receptors were stabilized, and then rinsed twice in 1X PBS. Pre-warmed Cell Stripper (a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution from Sigma) together with gentle scraping removed cells from the plates, and cells were immediately added to cold PBS with 10% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide and centrifuged. The supernatant was decanted and cells were either left unstained or stained with an anti-human CXCR4-PE-conjugated antibody (R&D Systems, Cat. #FAB170P) (diluted 1:50) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C and in the dark. After staining cells, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldahyde for 20 minutes and subsequently washed 3 times in cold PBS with 10% FBS. Cells were then resuspended in PBS supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide, and were analyzed using FacScan.Statistical analysisStudent\u2019s t test determined statistical significance. All samples were prepared in triplicate and experiments were conducted at least three times. Statistical power at the P<0.05 was considered significant.Figures and TableHuman mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) enhance tumor engraftment and growth of SUM102 breast cancer cells in vivo. A.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

        "content": "Tumor metastasis requires highly motile cells that can respond to appropriate stimuli. A2058 human melanoma cells were shown previously to secrete a highly potent autocrine motility factor (AMF) that stimulates chemokinetic movement. We have shown that the insulin polypeptides (IPs; insulin-like growth factors I and II [IGF-I, -II] and insulin) stimulated A2058 cell chemotaxis and chemokinesis. We now report that the IPs and AMF stimulate locomotion in other human malignant cell lines. Insulin (100 nM) induced motility of up to 50% of the magnitude of the AMF response in human carcinoma lines MDA-231 (breast), T24 (bladder), and OVCAR3 (ovarian). The tumorigenic and metastatic 5R Haras-transfected rat embryo fibroblast cell line responded to insulin with both chemotaxis and chemokinesis and was 100% of that seen for AMF. The ED50 for IGF-I in the carcinoma cell lines was in the order of I nM, but the magnitude of the responses at this concentration was 40% of the AMF-stimulated response, with the exception of the A2058 cells, which were maximally stimulated at I nM. IGF-II induced maximal motility of 75 to 130% of the AMF-stimulated response in the carcinoma lines with ED50 of less than or equal to 10 nM. IGF-II-stimulated motility in the carcinoma lines was predominantly chemotactic by modified checkerboard analysis. Cell pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited 90-100% of AMF-induced motility, whereas migration to the IPs was not pertussis toxinsusceptible. In growth studies, IGF-I induced mitogenesis up to 140% of basal media control growth. In general, maximal growth stimulation was seen at 100 nM IGF-I, and optimal migration was seen at 10 nM IGF-I. The IGFs are secreted by normal stroma in a number of organs that are common sites for primary and metastatic disease. Therefore, we suggest that IPs may be important homing and mitogenic signals for tumor cells in the process of invasion and metastasis and that the differential motility stimulation and respective mechanisms of action by these physiologically important agents may underlie the diversity of the metastatic process.",

        "full_text": "Rapid intraoperative insulin assay: a novel method to differentiate insulinoma from nesidioblastosis in the pediatric patientIntroductionHyperinsulinism is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. Causes can include nesidioblastosis, pancreatic islet cell tumors such as insulinoma, and associations with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Although new, improved imaging techniques have allowed for more precise preoperative localization of insulinomas, the differentiation of nesidioblastosis and insulinoma, particularly in children, can be challenging. To improve intraoperative localization and confirmation of successful resection of insulinoma, a novel hormonal assay, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay, is reported for the first time in a pediatric patient. This intraoperative radioimmunoassay for insulin yields results within several minutes and confirms complete resection of insulinoma.Case descriptionWe present a case of pancreatic insulinoma in a child with symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, causing seizures. The insulinoma was enucleated laparoscopically, and rapid intra-operative insulin assay used to determine the success of the procedure.Discussion and evaluationThis rapid intra-operative test provides a valuable adjunct for determining complete excision in complicated cases of recurrent or questionable insulinoma. Although not a common problem, for pediatric patients in whom the diagnosis is not clear, this test may provide a novel approach to confirming disease.ConclusionWe propose the use of this assay in facilitating intra-operative resection and confirmation of complete excision in pediatric patients. This population may especially benefit from this novel assay to confirm complete resection and to differentiate multiple etiologies of hyperinsulinism.BackgroundHyperinsulinism is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. Causes can include nesidioblastosis, pancreatic islet cell tumors such as insulinoma, and associations with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Pancreatic islet cell tumors have an annual incidence of 1 in 1,000,000, with insulinoma being the most common type, accounting for 70% to 80% of all pancreatic endocrine tumors. Peak incidence is in the third and fifth decades of life, but it can occur in all age groups. These tumors are usually solitary, benign, and diagnosed while still small because of clinical presentation of uncontrollable hypoglycemia. Insulinoma is equally distributed throughout the whole pancreatic gland. Preoperative localization is sometimes challenging, with up to 64% not localized at laparotomy. New improved imaging techniques have allowed for more precise preoperative localization. Noninvasive imaging modalities include transabdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While transabdominal US shows 30% sensitivity in detecting a tumor, conventional CT provides 73% sensitivity. Invasive imaging procedures such as angiography and transhepatic venous hormone sampling are more accurate in detecting tumor, but they are more expensive and depend on the experience of the person performing the study. Sensitivity with angiography is 35% to 65%, and 77% to 100% with transhepatic portal venous sampling. Selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling is another invasive method, with a sensitivity of nearly 100%. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the procedure of choice for tumor localization. With 2\u20133-mm resolution, EUS can be used with radial (diagnostic) or linear (for fine needle aspiration) echoendoscope and allows continuous imaging technique. Accuracy of EUS is 88% and, in combination with biphasic helical CT, increases to 97%. Intraoperative EUS can successfully localize tumors in 90% of cases and can determine tumor size and invasion into the duodenum as well as vascular invasion (portal vein, small mesenteric artery, splenic vein) metastasis into the regional lymph nodes. It may distinguish nonmalignant lesions from pancreatic carcinomas.Even with these diagnostic studies, localization of insulinoma can be difficult, and, especially in the child, must be differentiated from nesidioblastosis. This clinical and pathologic disease involves hyperplasia of the beta cells of the pancreas, which leads to persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) and can present in adults with organic hyperinsulinism. In infants, the annual incidence is 1 in 50,000 births for the sporadic form, but may be up to 1 in 2,500 births in certain regions. Treatment varies significantly, depending on symptoms, from medical management with diazoxide and chlorothiazide, nifedipine, glucagon, and octreotide to some who require partial or subtotal pancreatectomy. Surgery, however, results in high rates of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, with long-term complications of diabetes mellitus or malnutrition.To improve intraoperative localization and confirmation of successful resection, a novel hormonal assay, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay, has been developed. This intraoperative radioimmunoassay for insulin yields results within several minutes and confirms complete resection of insulinoma. It determines the level of active insulin molecule in the serum and is checked before insulinoma enucleation and right after enucleation intraoperatively. Although there is little guidance as to precise criteria for gauging success, one proposed protocol is similar to that used for quick parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay (i.e., a 50% drop). When insulin levels drop more than 50% of baseline within several minutes of insulinoma resection, the surgery is considered successful.Here we present a case of pancreatic insulinoma in a child with symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, causing seizures. The insulinoma was enucleated laparoscopically \u2013 a well-accepted technique for appropriately selected lesions. Intraoperative insulin measurements confirmed complete tumor resection. We aim to demonstrate that for the pediatric patient, in particular, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay has many advantages for the surgeon in confirming successful resection of insulin-producing tumors.Case presentationThe patient is a 13-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented in December of 2004 with a general tonic-clonic seizure after a basketball game. Blood glucose was 33 mg/dL. Workup was delayed. He had a second seizure in late January 2005 associated with a glucose level less than 40 mg/dL. At that time the C-peptide level was 8.1 U/dL. The patient was admitted for a 72-hour inpatient fast in late March 2005, and had a seizure at hour 18 of the fast. His glucose was 33 mg/dL with an insulin level equal to 21 U/dL, confirming the diagnosis of insulinoma. CT scanning and MRI were performed and demonstrated a 1.8 cm mass in the neck of the pancreas. After several additional seizures he was referred to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital for evaluation and admitted from the office for glucose monitoring and preoperative preparation. The patient underwent intraoperative US followed by laparoscopic enucleation of a pancreatic islet cell tumor.Operative procedureAn arterial line was inserted to allow frequent glucose testing during the operative procedure. The patient's baseline glucose level was 54 mg/dL with a baseline insulin level of 125 U/dL (normal 10\u201386 U/dL). Glucose solution was administered intraoperatively to maintain a blood glucose level greater than 100 mg/dL. After induction of general anesthesia and positioning in the modified lithotomy position, the abdomen was insufflated to 15 mm Hg with CO2. Two 12 mm trocars and three 5 mm trocars were inserted and the lesser sac entered through the omentum, preserving the right gastroepiploic vessels to expose the anterior surface of the pancreas. The inferior aspect of the pancreas was then mobilized to allow inspection of the posterior surface. The splenic vein was clearly identified and dissected. The pancreas was dissected medially and a space posterior to the pancreas and anterior to the portal vein was developed. Laparoscopic US identified a hypoechoic mass in the neck of the pancreas, which was enucleated using a combination of blunt and sharp dissection techniques. The lesion was placed in a retrieval sac and extracted.Intraoperative insulin levels of 172 U/dL were measured after initial identification of the insulinoma. At 5 and 10 minutes postexcision, values dropped to 87 U/dL and 68 U/dL, respectively, demonstrating complete resection. Total operating time was 120 minutes. Postoperatively, the patient's blood glucose increased to 130 mg/dL.The patient developed a pancreatic fistula postoperatively, which was initially controlled via drainage catheter and conservative measures, but ultimately required re-exploration with a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The patient subsequently recovered without complication and final pathology showed a 1.4 \u00d7 1.2 \u00d7 0.9 cm, well-differentiated, intermediate grade insulinoma.Rapid insulin assayTo determine insulin levels intraoperatively, we used the STAT-IntraOperative-System (Future Diagnostics, Arlington, MA). This is a chemiluminescence immunoassay for the quantitative determination of insulin levels in human serum and EDTA plasma. The assay uses two monoclonal antibodies against insulin. Patient samples are introduced into wells and incubated for 7 minutes. The washed wells are then placed into the STAT-Read, which calculates insulin levels by measuring emissions of light in relative light units. The time between obtaining a blood sample and reading a result is under 12 minutes.Discussion and evaluationThis rapid intraoperative test gives us a valuable adjunct for determining complete excision in complicated cases of recurrent or questionable insulinoma. Although not a common problem, for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, this test may provide a novel approach to confirmation. This is especially the case for the pediatric patient. In this report, we highlight the utility of the rapid intraoperative insulin assay as an effective and unique method to confirm curative resection of insulinoma in the pediatric patient, a population where other hyperinsulin-producing conditions, such as nesidioblastosis, must be considered as well. In children, the etiology of hyperinsulinism can be a diagnostic challenge. This assay may represent particular utility intraoperatively to confirm curative resection.Rapid determination of insulin levels with detection of C-peptide is a new modality for diagnosing insulinoma. C-peptide is a 31 amino acid fragment, which is split from the proinsulin molecule to form bioactive insulin in the serum. The analysis is performed by radioimmunoassay and can be done using serum from peripheral blood in a rapid time period. Insulin has a short serum half-life of about 5 minutes; 50% is cleared by the liver and 30% by the kidneys. Several authors have reported the use of intraoperative insulin monitoring during resection of insulinomas in adults, in an attempt to improve intraoperative resection and outcome. Although intraoperative assays for parathyroidectomy are well established and available in many centers \u2013 they are currently the most widely used intraoperative means for hormone measurement in the United States \u2013 the rapid insulin assay is more complicated, is not as widely available, and requires a dedicated team in order to ensure reproducibility and reliability. This assay is a valuable technique that, when performed well, can serve as a useful adjunct to the management and operative resection of patients with known or suspected insulinoma. Our goal is to raise awareness regarding this technique and potential applications that may be useful to the surgeon.Treatment of insulinoma is by surgical resection. However, the surgeon may not know preoperatively if the insulinoma is single or multiple or present in a background of islet cell hyperplasia. To answer these questions, the rapid intraoperative serum insulin assay may be useful. In this case report we have presented a child with an insulinoma for whom intraoperative insulin measurements determined completeness of excision with subsequent cure. Postoperatively, the patient remained normoglycemic and all biochemical parameters returned to normal.ConclusionIn conclusion, we present a confirmatory case demonstrating the utility of the rapid intraoperative insulin assay in facilitating intraoperative resection and confirmation of complete excision of insulinoma for the first time in a pediatric patient. This population may especially benefit from this novel assay to confirm complete resection and to differentiate multiple etiologies of hyperinsulinism in the pediatric population.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsPerformed Surgery: VES, WBIPreparation of Manuscript: VES, AS, WBICritical Review and Corrections: VES, WBIAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in infancy and childhood \u2013 resolving the enigmaLaparoscopic pancreatic surgery for islet cell tumors of the pancreasResults of a prospective strategy to diagnose, localize, and resect insulinomasLocalization of islet cell tumors of the pancreas: a review of current techniquesValue of tumor localization in patients with insulinomaAssessment of selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling to localize insulin-secreting tumoursValue of intra-arterial calcium stimulated venous sampling for regionalization of pancreatic insulinomasEndoscopic ultrasonography for the preoperative localization of insulinomasNoninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome: an update in 10 surgically treated patientsPractical management of hyperinsulinism in infancyNesidioblastosis: an old term and a new understandingLaparoscopic pancreatic resection: single-institution experience of 19 patientsLaparoscopic localization and resection of insulinomasLaparoscopic enucleation of a solitary pancreatic insulinomaIntraoperative insulin measurement during surgical management of insulinomasEvaluation of a new fully automated one-step C-peptide chemiluminescence assay (LIAISON C-Peptid)Evaluation of preoperative and intraoperative arterial stimulation and venous sampling for diagnosis and surgical resection of insulinomaRole of intraoperative insulin monitoring in surgical management of insulinomaRapid insulin assay for intraoperative confirmation of complete resection ofinsulinomas"

Fibroblasts are the most abundant and active stromal cells, which exhort cancer cells all over the various carcinogenic steps. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-related pro-carcinogenic effects are mediated through paracrine factors, which are under the control of several tumor suppressor genes such as p16 and p53. In addition to their cell-autonomous tumor suppressor function, these proteins possess also non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive effects that they manifest from stromal fibroblasts.CHEK2 is another tumor suppressor gene, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of various types of sporadic tumors and is a low penetrance-predisposing gene to sarcoma, brain tumors and familial breast cancer. The two most studied breast cancer predisposing variants of the CHEK2 gene are the 100delC deletion in the kinase domain in exon 10, and the 470\u00a0T\u2009>\u2009C (I157T) missense mutation in the fork-head-associated (FHA) domain in exon 3. These 2 mutations are associated with approximately 2- fold increased risk of breast cancer. A novel recurrent CHEK2 Y390C mutation has been recently identified in high-risk Chinese breast cancer patients. This mutation impairs CHEK2 activity and is associated with increased breast cancer risk.CHEK2 is a multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene that encodes a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase. CHEK2 enables the link between ATM/ATR kinases and downstream checkpoint effectors such as p53 during DNA-damage response. When activated Chk2 phosphorylates various proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, p53 signaling and apoptosis. Furthermore, CHEK2 plays also a major role in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Indeed, the expression of several SASP-related cytokines, particularly the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, is under the control of a pathway involving CHEK2. Therefore, in addition to its capital role in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing fixation of potentially carcinogenic mutations, CHEK2 is also involved in regulating cellular communication with its microenvironment. Like senescent cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts have also a secretary phenotype responsible for their procarcinogenic effects. Therefore, we sought to investigate the potential role of CHEK2 in the secretory phenotype of breast stromal fibroblasts and their activation.We have shown that CHEK2 inhibits the procarcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts and has a non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive function through repressing the expression/secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6.MethodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblast cells were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. Breast tissues were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center. Signed informed consent was obtained from all the patients under the Research Ethical Committee Project number RAC#2031091. While CAFs derived from tumors, TCFs were developed from histologically normal tissues located at least 2\u00a0cm away from tumors (invasive ductal carcinomas). Processing of breast cancer tissues was performed after routine examination by certified anatomical pathologist using hematoxilin and eosin (HE)-stained sections. NBF-1 cells were developed from healthy age-matched female who performed breast reduction surgery. In the present experiments CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, in the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). MDA-MB-231and MCF-10A cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were authenticated before purchase by their standard short tandem repeat DNA typing methodology, and were routinely tested for the presence of the relevant markers, and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (Saint Louis, MO, USA) except for antibiotics and antimycotics solutions, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in humidified incubator with 5\u00a0% CO2.Anti-SDF-1 (MAB310) and IgG (6-101-C-ABS) from R&D systems; anti-IL-6 (17901) from Sigma, USA. Blocking antibodies were used at 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.RNA purification and quantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA was purified using the TRI reagent (Sigma) and single stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was obtained from reverse transcription of 1\u00a0\u03bcg of RNA using RT-PCR kit (BD Biosciences) and following the manufacturer protocol. cDNA was then amplified with 1U Taq polymerase, dNTPs (50\u00a0mM), and primers (25 pmol each). For real time RT-PCR Syber green and platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) were used and the amplifications were performed utilizing the Bio-Rad iQ5 multicolor Real time PCR detection system. All reactions were performed in triplicates and the data were analyzed using the 2(\u2212Delta Delta C(T)) method.CHEK2: 5\u2032-TGTCCCTCCCAAACCAGTAGTTGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTCACAGCCCCATGGCAGCG-3\u2032IL-6: 5\u2032-GACAAAGCCAGAGTCCTTCAGAGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTAGGTTTGCCGAGTAGATCT-3\u2032GAPDH: 5\u2032-GAGTCCACTGGCGTCTTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGGGTGCTAAGCAGTTGGT-3\u2032SDF1: 5\u2032-TAGTCAAGTGCGTCCACGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGACACACCACAGCACAAAC-3\u2032The primers are:Cell proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5-1.104/well and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with SFCM and incubated for different time intervals (0, 24 and 48\u00a0h). Cell proliferation was measured by the tetrazolium salt WST-1 colorimetric assay, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The WST-1 reagent was added to each well, and the plates were then incubated for 4\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The amount of formazan was quantified using ELISA reader at 450\u00a0nm of absorbance.Cellular lysate preparation and immunoblottingThis has been performed as previously described. Antibodies directed against alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), Stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), Twist-1, Vimentin (RV202), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and N-cadherin were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); E-cadherin (24E10), EpCam (UV1D9), Chk2 (2662) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); p53 (DO-1) and Glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, FL-335) was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA).ELISA assaysSupernatants from 24\u00a0h fibroblast cell cultures were harvested, and ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (R&D Systems). The OD was used at 450-nm on a standard ELISA plate-reader. These experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least twice.Chemotaxis and invasion assayThe 24-well BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers were used as per the manufacturer guideline (BD Bioscience). 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells were added to the upper wells separated by an 8 \u03bcm pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with Diff Quick stain (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane with Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil, and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification; 40x). Each assay was performed in triplicate.siRNA transfectionCHEK2-siRNA (SIH600921A) was obtained from SABiosciences, and the transfection was performed using lipofectamin (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer.Viral infectionLentivirus based vectors bearing CHEK2-ORF and the control (Origene, RC212127L1) were used to prepare lentiviral supernatant from 293FT cells. Lentiviral supernatants were collected 48\u00a0h post-transfection, filtered and used for infection. 24\u00a0h later, media were replaced with complete medium and cells were grown for 3\u00a0days.Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24\u00a0h, and then medium was collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until needed.Quantification of protein expression levelProtein signal intensity of each band was determined using ImageQuant TL Software (GE Healthcare). Next, dividing the obtained value of each band by the values of the corresponding internal control allowed a correction of the loading differences.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by student\u2019s t-test (two tailed and unpaired) and p-values\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered as statistically significant.ResultsCHEK2 is down-regulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts\nCHEK2 expression is down-regulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and 50\u00a0\u03bcg of proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. b Total RNA was extracted from the indicated cells and the amount of the\u00a0CHEK2 mRNA was assessed by qRT-PCR. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.DWe started the present study by assessing the level of the Chk2 protein in CAFs and their corresponding TCFs (tumor counterpart fibroblasts) isolated from the same patients. To this end, we prepared whole cell lysates from 12 CAF/TCF pairs, and then we performed immunoblotting analysis using specific Chk2 antibody and GAPDH was used as internal control. Figure\u00a01a shows that while Chk2 was undetectable in both CAF-180 and TCF-180 cells, the level of the protein was reduced in all the other CAFs as compared to their corresponding TCF cells. The level of Chk2 was also very low in TCF-87 and TCF-148 (Fig.\u00a01a). Next, we assessed the expression of the CHEK2 mRNA level in CAFs and their counterpart TCFs. Total RNA from the same 12 CAF/TCF pairs was purified and the CHEK2 mRNA was amplified by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using specific primers, and GAPDH was used as internal control. Figure\u00a01b shows that the CHEK2 mRNA level was lower in 11 out of 12 CAFs (92\u00a0%) as compared to their corresponding TCF cells. On the other hand, CHEK2 mRNA level was similar in TCF-900 and CAF-900\u00a0cells (Fig.\u00a01b). Therefore, Fig.\u00a01a and b shows that, in general, there is correlation between the mRNA and protein expression levels among the CAF/TCF pairs. For 3 pairs TCF/CAF-118, TCF/CAF-180 and TCF/CAF-900 there was no correlation between the mRNA and protein levels of CHEK2. This shows that CHEK2 is down-regulated in most CAFs as compared to their corresponding TCFs at both the mRNA and protein levels.CHEK2 induces p53 but represses the expression of \u03b1-SMA, SDF-1 and IL-6 in breast stromal fibroblasts\nCHEK2 represses the expression/secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6.\na Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were used for immunoblotting analysis. The numbers below the bands indicate the corresponding expression levels after loading correction against GAPDH. b Total RNA was extracted from the indicated cells and used to assess the mRNA levels of SDF-1 and IL-1 using qRT-PCR and specific primers. c Conditioned media from the indicated cells were collected after 24\u00a0h and the levels of the indicated proteins were determined by ELISA, and were presented in the respective histograms. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D, *, p value\u2009<\u20090.0001After showing the reduced level of CHEK2 in CAFs as compared to their respective TCFs from the same patients, we sought to investigate the potential effect of CHEK2 specific down-regulation on the activation of these cells. To this end, we knocked-down CHEK2 in TCF-169 cells and the obtained results were compared with those of the corresponding CAF-169 cells. Figure\u00a02a shows efficient down-regulation (6 fold) of Chk2 in TCF-169 by CHEK2-siRNA as compared to the corresponding control. This mirrors the expression of Chk2 in TCF-169 and their corresponding CAF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02a). Interestingly, while the 3 markers \u03b1-SMA, IL-6 and SDF-1 were undetectable in TCF-169 and control-siRNA cells, they were strongly up-regulated upon CHEK2 down-regulation, reaching levels similar to those observed in CAF-169 (Fig.\u00a02a). On the other hand, CHEK2 knock-down down-regulated p53 (6 fold) as compared to control cells, reaching a level similar to that observed in CAF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02a). Next, we assessed the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation on the expression of SDF-1 and IL-6 at the mRNA levels using qRT-PCR. Figure\u00a02b shows 2 fold increase in the level of SDF-1 and 3 fold up-regulation of IL-6 in TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells as compared to controls. This parallels the levels of SDF-1 and IL-6 in TCF-169 and their corresponding CAF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02b). This suggests that CHEK2 represses the expression of these genes in breast stromal fibroblasts, indicating that CHEK2 down-regulation may represent an important step towards the activation of these cells.CHEK2 represses the secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6 from breast stromal fibroblastsTo further show the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation on the expression of important secreted cytokines, we assessed the effect of CHEK2 Knock-down on the secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6. To this end, serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) was collected from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA and their corresponding control cells, and then the secreted levels of SDF-1 and IL-6 was assessed by ELISA. Figure\u00a02c shows that the down-regulation of CHEK2 increased the secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6 by 3.3 and 2 fold, respectively. This mirrors the secreted levels of SDF-1 and IL-6 in TCF-169 and their corresponding CAF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02c).CHEK2 represses the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts\nCHEK2 represses the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts. TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells and their controls (a), NBF-1-CHEK2-siRNA cells and their controls (b) as well as CAF-169 and TCF-169 cells (c) were seeded with SFM in the inserts of BD bio-coat\u2122 chambers (BD biosciences) (without matrigel, for migration) or coated with matrigel layer (for invasion), while complete media was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers. After 24\u00a0h of incubation, cells were stained with Diff-Quick stain then counted. Upper panels: images of the invaded and migrated cells. Histograms: Average numbers of invaded and migrated cells. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D, *, p value\u2009<\u20090.0001Next, we examined the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation on the migratory and invasiveness abilities of stromal fibroblasts. To this end, TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells as well as their respective controls were seeded with SFM in the upper inserts of BD bio-coat\u2122 chambers (BD biosciences) (without matrigel, for migration) or coated with matrigel layer (for invasion), while complete media was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers. Cells were then incubated overnight to allow migration and invasion. Figure\u00a03a shows that TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells were 2- and 3- fold more motile and invasive than their controls, respectively. Similar results were obtained when CHEK2 was knocked-down using the same siRNA in the normal breast stromal fibroblasts NBF-1 (Fig.\u00a03b). These results mirror the migration/invasion abilities of TCF-169 and their corresponding CAF-169 (Fig.\u00a03c). This indicates that CHEK2 represses the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts.CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts enhances the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner\nCHEK2 deficient fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner. SFCM were collected from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells and their controls, and then were added to MCF10A (a)\u00a0or MDA-MB-231 (b)\u00a0cells that were seeded on 96-well plates. The proliferation was measured at the indicated times using the WTS-1 assay. Error bars represent\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, p value\u2009<\u20090.0001To confirm the active status of CHEK2-defective fibroblasts, we tested the paracrine procarcinogenic effects of these fibroblasts. To this end, we first examined the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation in stromal fibroblasts on the proliferation of epithelial cells utilizing indirect co-culturing. Therefore, SFCM was collected from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA cells and the corresponding control cells, and were used for culturing the non-cancerous MCF-10A and the cancer MDA-MB-231 epithelial cells seeded in 96 well plates. Cell proliferation was assessed using the WST-1 reagent. Figure\u00a04 shows that after 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h of incubation, SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA enhanced cell proliferation as compared to SFCM from control cells, in both cell lines. This indicates that CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts enhances their ability in increasing the proliferation of breast epithelial cells via paracrine signaling.CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts promotes the migration/invasion abilities of breast cancer cells in an SDF-1/IL-6-dependent manner\nCHEK2-deficient fibroblast secretions stimulate invasion/migration in an SDF1- and IL-6-dependent manner and enhance mesenchymal features in breast cancer cells. a SFCM were collected after 24\u00a0h of incubation from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA and their control cells, and were added to MDA-MB-231 cells (105) that were seeded onto the upper compartment of the plates and incubated for 24\u00a0h. The numbers of invaded and migrated cells were presented in histograms. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D. *: p value <0.001, as compared to the control lane 1. b MDA-MB-231 cells were treated as indicated, and then the migration and invasion abilities were assessed as described in A. c MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with SFCM from the indicated cells for 24\u00a0h, and then cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using the indicated antibodiesWe have next studied the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation in stromal fibroblasts on the migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, these cells were seeded in the upper inserts of the migration and invasion chambers in the presence of SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA and control cells, while the lower inserts of the chambers contained SFM. Cells were incubated overnight to allow migration and invasion under the attraction force of the chemo-attractants that are present in the SFCM. MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated/invaded were fixed, stained and counted in 5 random fields. Figure\u00a05a shows that MDA-MB-231 cells that were exposed to SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA had higher migration/invasion activities as compared to cells exposed to SFCM from the corresponding control cells. Indeed, SFCM from CHEK2-deficient cells enhanced the migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells 2- and 7- fold as compared to control cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a05a). These results provide evidence that CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts increases the paracrine pro-migration and -invasion of cancer cells, which further confirms the active status of CHEK2-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts.Next, we sought to investigate the possible role of SDF-1 and IL-6 in the paracrine effects of CHEK2-deficient cells. To this end, both cytokines were inhibited either separately or simultaneously using specific neutralizing antibodies in the SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA. Anti-IgG was also used as negative control. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with these media, and then the migration/invasion abilities of these cells were studied as described above. Figure\u00a05b shows that the inhibition of SDF-1 reduced by 2 fold the migration potential of breast cancer cells as compared to cells exposed to anti-IgG. Interestingly, the inhibition of IL-6 was more potent, reducing the migration to a level similar to that obtained by the double inhibition (7 fold lower as compared to the control). In addition, the inhibition of SDF-1, IL-6 or both in SFCM collected from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA reduced the invasion potential of breast cancer cells 2.5, 5 and 6 fold, respectively (Fig.\u00a05b). This shows that the paracrine IL-6 effect on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells is stronger than that of SDF-1, and that the pro-migratory/-invasiveness effects of CHEK2-deficient stromal fibroblasts is mediated through increase in the secretion of SDF-1 and IL-6, which are in normal situations repressed by CHEK2.CHEK2 down-regulation in breast stromal fibroblasts enhances the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells in a paracrine mannerTo further study the effect of CHEK2 down-regulation on breast cancer cells, we investigated the paracrine effect of CHEK2 deficient fibroblasts on the mesenchymal and epithelial markers of MDA-MB-231 cells. These cells were treated with SFM conditioned with TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA or TCF-169-control-siRNA for 24\u00a0h. Subsequently, protein extracts were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies for EMT markers. Figure\u00a05c shows that the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and Epcam were reduced 2.3 and 12 fold in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA as compared to SFCM from control cells. On the other hand, the levels of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, Twist1 and vimentin were 2.3, 12 and 3 fold higher in breast cancer cells treated with SFCM from TCF-169-CHEK2-siRNA as compared to SFCM from control cells (Fig.\u00a05c). This indicates that SFCM from CHEK2-deficient fibroblast cells can enhance the EMT process in breast cancer cells.Ectopic expression of CHEK2 suppresses the procarcinogenic features of cancer-associated fibroblasts\nCHEK2 upregulation represses breast stromal fibroblasts and their paracrine procarcinogenic effects. CAF-169 cells transfected with CHEK2-ORF (CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF) or control plasmid (CAF-169-control). a Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were used for immunoblotting analysis.

The migration and invasion abilities were assessed as described in Fig.\u00a05a. Error bars represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D. *: p value <0.001In an effort to further confirm the role of CHEK2 in suppressing the procarcinogenic features of breast stromal fibroblasts, we next investigated the effects of CHEK2 ectopic expression in CAF-169 cells, wherein CHEK2 level was shown to be very low (Fig.\u00a01a). Therefore, CAF-169 cells were transfected with a lenti-virus-based plasmid bearing CHEK2-ORF (CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF), and an empty vector was used as control. Whole cell lysates were prepared and used for immunoblotting analysis. Figure\u00a06a shows that the Chk2 level was 2.3 fold higher in CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF cells as compared to the controls. Interestingly, ectopic expression of the CHEK2 gene in CAF-169 cells strongly reduced the level of both SDF-1 and IL-6 (Fig.\u00a06a). These levels mirror the SDF-1 and IL-6 levels observed in TCF-169 cells (Fig.\u00a02b). This finding further supports the role of CHEK2 in suppressing the expression of SDF-1 and IL-6. Next, we studied the migratory and the invasiveness abilities of CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF cells, using BD chambers. While complete medium was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers, cells were added to the upper wells in the presence of SFM. Figure\u00a06b shows that ectopic expression of CHEK2 reduced the motility (40\u00a0%) and the invasiveness (34\u00a0%) of active CAF-169 cells as compared to control cells. This confirms that CHEK2 represses the migration/invasion abilities in breast stromal fibroblasts.To further show the role of CHEK2 in suppressing the procarcinogenic effects of CAFs, we investigated the paracrine effect of CHEK2 expression on the migration/invasion capacities of MDA-MB-231. Cells were seeded in the inserts of BD chambers, and SFM conditioned with CAF-169-CHEK2-ORF cells (SFCM-CHEK2-ORF) as well as control cells (SFCM-control) were placed in the lower wells of the chambers. Cells were incubated overnight to allow migration and invasion. Figure\u00a06c shows that SFCM-CHEK2-ORF reduced the motility (3 fold) and the invasiveness (2.5 fold) of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to SFCM-control. This further confirms that CHEK2 represses the paracrine pro-migration/invasion effects of breast stromal fibroblasts. Together, these results indicate that ectopic expression of the CHEK2 gene in the active CAF-169 fibroblasts transforms these cells to a normal state.DiscussionMyofibroblasts actively contribute to the growth, expansion and dissemination of neoplastic epithelial cells. However, the genes and pathways controlling myofibroblast-related tumor-promoting effects are not fully delineated. Several lines of evidence indicate the implication of tumor suppressor genes in controlling the procarcinogenic effects of stromal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. In the present study we have shown that the tumor suppressor Chk2 protein plays an important role in controlling mammary stromal fibroblast autocrine and paracrine signaling. Indeed, CHEK2 is down-regulated in CAFs as compared to their corresponding TCFs, isolated from the same patients. In addition, we have seen inter-individual variation in the CHEK2 expression among TCF cells. This could be due to different tumor features such as the stage or the grade. Similar differences were previously observed for p16. The CHEK2 decrease suggests a role of cancer cells in suppressing CHEK2 expression in fibroblast cells present in their vicinity, either directly or indirectly. In fact, several lines of evidence indicate that neoplastic cells have the ability to affect their microenvironment and modulate gene expression through secreted factors. This in principle leads to the activation of stromal cells, which in turn fuel the carcinogenic process and promote tumor growth and spread through functional cross-talk with tumor cells. To study the role of CHEK2 down-regulation in these processes, we specifically down-regulated this gene in breast stromal fibroblasts using specific siRNA, and we studied the consequent autocrine and paracrine effects. We have shown that CHEK2 down-regulation activates breast stromal fibroblasts and enhances their paracrine procarcinogenic effects. Indeed, CHEK2-defective cells exhibited higher migratory and invasive capacities, expressed lower levels of p53 and higher levels of the myofibroblast markers \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1, and enhanced the migration/invasion abilities of breast cancer cells and their mesenchymal features in a paracrine manner. Indeed, CHEK2 down-regulation in fibroblasts paracrinaly induced the three major mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, Twist-1 and vimentin, and decreased two major epithelial markers E-cadherin and Epcam in breast cancer cells. This indicates that CHEK2-defective breast stromal fibroblasts enhance the pro-metastatic EMT process in epithelial cells in a paracrine manner. On the other hand, ectopic expression of CHEK2 repressed the migratory/invasiveness abilities of active breast stromal fibroblasts as well as their paracrine effects on breast cancer cells. This confirmed the suppressive role of CHEK2 in the procarcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts.The present data showed also that in addition to its autonomous tumor suppressor function, CHEK2 has also a non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressor activity. This paracrine effect is mediated through controlling the expression/secretion of the pro-carcinogenic cytokines SDF-1 and IL-6, may be through p53 down-regulation. Indeed, p53 represses the expression of both SDF-1 and IL-6, which\u00a0are important promoters of tumor growth and progression. Furthermore, specific inhibition of secreted SDF-1 or IL-6 suppressed the pro-migratory/invasiveness effects of CHEK2-deficient stromal fibroblasts. Interestingly, the double blockage had an inhibitory effect similar to that obtained by the inhibition of IL-6 alone, which was stronger than SDF-1 inhibition (Fig.\u00a05). This indicates that the effects of IL-6 and SDF-1 inhibition were synergistic despite the fact that the 2 molecules act through different receptors and pathways, however, a potential functional interaction between the activated pathways is possible.In addition to Chk2, other important tumor suppressor proteins such as p16, p21, p53, PTEN and CAV-1 are also implicated in repressing the procarcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts both in vitro and in vivo. This clearly shows that these tumor suppressor proteins represses breast carcinogenesis in both epithelial as well as stromal cells.ConclusionsThe present findings have shown that in addition to its well-known cell-autonomous tumor suppressor function within incipient pro-carcinogenic epithelial cells, stromal fibroblast CHEH2, like other tumor suppressor genes, exerts also non-cell-autonomous effects in breast tumorigenesis. Therefore, stromal fibroblast CHEK2 might constitute a valid therapeutic target to stop tumor progression and/or recurrence.AbbreviationsATCC, American type culture collection; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; siRNA, small interfering RNAReferencesMolecular characterisation of the tumour microenvironment in breast cancerRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisp16(INK4A) Represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsOrigin and function of tumor stroma fibroblastsCHK2 kinase: cancer susceptibility and cancer therapy - two sides of the same coin?CHEK2*1100delC genotyping for clinical assessment of breast cancer risk: meta-analyses of 26,000 patient cases and 27,000 controlsThe CHEK2 I157T variant and breast cancer susceptibility: a systematic review and meta-analysisWang N, Ding H, Liu C, Li X, Wei L, Yu J, Liu M, Ying M, Gao W, Jiang H, et al.

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

Our work suggests a physiological lung and lymph node metastasis suppressor role for RhoA GTPase in breast cancer.IntroductionRho GTPases belong to the Ras GTPase superfamily and in humans consists of about 20 members. Among them, RhoA, Rac1 and CDC42 are the most studied Rho GTPases. These GTPases act as intermediate signal transducers for a diverse array of cell surface receptors such as cytokine receptors, cadherins, integrins, GPCR, and tyrosine kinases, and therefore regulate major cellular events such as cell polarity, cell migration, cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton rearrangements, vesicular trafficking, and gene expression. Aberrant Rho GTPase signaling results in neurological and immunological abnormalities, and malignant cell transformation.Like most other GTPases, RhoA and their activating proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), are commonly believed to be pro-proliferative and act as cancer oncogenes. The evidence for the oncogenic activity of RhoA was first reported using dominant negative and constitutively active RhoA mutants in fibroblasts. While activating RhoA mutants enhanced the transformation activity of a weakly oncogenic RAS mutant, a dominant negative RhoA mutant abrogated the oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation. Later, RhoA was reported to be overexpressed in several epithelial human cancer tissue samples including, breast, testicular, liver, colorectal, ovarian and gastric carcinoma.Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have identified hitherto undiscovered mutations in cancers and identified recurrent loss-of-function and gain-of-dominant-negative function mutations in RhoA in lymphoma, leukemia and several solid tumors. These latest discoveries, therefore, suggested a possible tumor suppressor function for RhoA in cancers. Indeed, studies with mouse models have demonstrated the tumorigenic and metastatic functions of the identified RhoA dominant-negative alleles in colorectal cancer.In addition, analysis of the RNA-seq data generated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project revealed high expression of several RhoGAP genes, which are the upstream negative regulators of RhoA, in basal-like breast cancer tumors raising the possibility that RhoGAPs are oncogenic. The oncogenic role of a RhoGAP named ARHGAP18 in breast cancer was subsequently proven with mouse transplantation model. Importantly, ARHGAP18 was shown to enhance metastasis partly by inactivating RhoA.Although these recent advances in the field support a tumor suppressive role for RhoA, a comprehensive mechanistic analysis on altered RhoA expression in primary tumors and its subsequent effects on tumor microenvironment and metastasis is lacking. In this study, using the highly metastatic 4T1 orthotopic mouse model, which closely resembles the human triple negative breast cancer, we show that downregulation of RhoA expression increases breast cancer lung metastasis. Mechanistically our study suggests that by increasing the expression of chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, decreased RhoA expression increases the proclivity of cancer cells for the sentinel lymph node and enables the cancer cells to have access to the circulation and metastasize.ResultsRhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion in vitroRhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion in vitro.

Although early work suggested a potential oncogenic role for RhoA, numerous recent studies start to challenge this notion. To further investigate the role of RhoA in breast cancer, we stably down-regulated RhoA expression by lentiviral transduction of specific shRNAs (Fig.\u00a01a) and measured the effects of the RhoA knockdown on cancer cells proliferation and invasion. Two different triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (TNBC) were used to ensure the observed effects were not cell type specific. While reduced RhoA expression significantly increased breast cancer cells invasion through Matrigel (Fig.\u00a01b), it did not have a noticeable effect on cell proliferation as measured by two different assays (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). As a positive control for our proliferation assay, we treated breast cancer cells with a selective MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, and observed an expected near-complete suppression on colony formation in clonogenic growth assay (Fig.\u00a01c).We reasoned that if the effect of RhoA knockdown on breast cancer cell invasion is RhoA specific and physiologically relevant, we would expect to observe the opposite effect when RhoA expression or activity is increased. Indeed, stable expression of a constitutively active RhoA variant, RhoAQ63L, in both BT20 and MDA-MB231 considerably decreased their proclivity to invade (Fig.\u00a01d). Together, these results suggested that in breast cancer cells, RhoA suppresses cell invasiveness.RhoA suppresses breast cancer lung metastasis burden in miceRhoA suppresses breast cancer lung metastasis burden in mice.

Metastasis is a complex multimodal activity that involves both host and tumor cells and can only be adequately addressed with an animal model. To investigate the possible role of RhoA in breast cancer metastasis, we exploited the well-established 4T1 syngeneic murine breast cancer model. The 4T1 TNBC cell line was originally derived from a spontaneous mammary tumor in a Balb/c mouse. Hence, it is widely utilized for syngeneic orthotopic mammary tumor allograft experiments. We generated a panel of lentiviral-mediated stable RhoA knockdowns in 4T1 cells with different levels of knockdowns, and used two of them, with a 30% (shRhoA 34) and a 50% (shRhoA 32) knockdown, for subsequent experiments (Fig.\u00a02a). Concurring with human breast cancer cells results, reduced RhoA expression significantly increased 4T1 cells invasion through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a02b). Significantly, similar effects were observed with stable expression of a dominant negative RhoAT19N, but the opposite effect was observed when the constitutively active RhoAQ63L was expressed in 4T1 cells (Fig.\u00a02c). Collectively, these findings strongly suggested that the mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells could be used to investigate the role of RhoA in metastasis.To address this question, we first engineered 4T1 cells to express a GFP-LUC hybrid protein to allow the growth and metastasis of the tumor to be monitored by luciferase bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Upon orthotopic implantation of 4T1 cells, all mice in RhoA knockdown and control groups developed primary tumors. In accord with our in vitro findings where RhoA knockdown did not influence breast cancer cell proliferation, at 30 days post-implantation we did not observe any statistically significant changes in weights or expression levels of proliferation antigen ki67 in RhoA knockdown primary tumors when compared with knockdown control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 in RhoA knockdown primary tumors as well (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). On the contrary, bioluminescent imaging of mice at 29 days post-implantation revealed possible distant metastases in mice implanted with the highest RhoA knockdown (shRhoA 32) 4T1 cells (Fig.\u00a02d) showing a dose-dependent effect of RhoA knockdown on cancer metastasis. Indeed, mice implanted with shRhoA 32 knockdown 4T1 cells exhibited a significantly higher lung metastasis burden compared to other groups during histology analysis (Fig.\u00a02e,f). In a complementary approach, we also down regulated the activity of RhoA in 4T1 cells by stably expressing the dominant negative RhoAT19N allele. Significantly, expression of RhoAT19N had the same effect on lung metastasis as the knockdown of RhoA expression in 4T1 cells and with a minimal effect on tumor weights (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Collectively, these findings suggested that RhoA could act as a physiological suppressor of breast cancer lung metastasis in mice.RhoA suppresses breast cancer sentinel lymph node metastasis in miceIt has been thought that invasive breast cancer cells from the primary tumor gain access to the systemic circulation through intra-tumoral and peripheral blood vasculature. However, with novel and more sensitive research technologies, scientists have identified that for breast cancer, the major systemic metastasis route is through the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Once tumor cells reach the SLN, they can access the systemic circulation directly without first passing down to the next lymph node.RhoA suppresses breast cancer sentinel lymph node metastasis in mice.

N\u2009=\u20093, ns- not significant *P\u2009<\u2009 0.05, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (two-tailed).It is possible that RhoA suppresses the lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells by interfering with the access of the cancer cells to the SLN. To examine this possibility, four weeks after implantation, we harvested the draining/sentinel lymph nodes (right axillary LN) from the cancer cells injected sites and processed them for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. As a control, we also harvested lymph nodes (left inguinal LN) on the contralateral side of the primary tumor. IHC analysis of the SLNs with an epithelial cell specific CK8 antibody revealed that the shRhoA 32 knockdown group mice have higher CK8 staining compared to the control mice, while no statistical significance in CK8 staining in the inguinal lymph nodes was observed between RhoA knockdown and control knockdown mice (Fig.\u00a03a). Similar results were observed with a GFP antibody, which specifically stained the 4T1 cancer cells (Fig.\u00a03b). Collectively, these observations suggested that when the RhoA expression is reduced, invasive 4T1 cells reached the axillary sentinel lymph node more efficiently than the control cells and readily gain access to the systemic circulation for spreading into other organs including the lungs.Metastasis is a complex multiple-step process. In addition to invading the draining lymph node and entering the circulation, the circulating cancer cells must survive the hostile environmental conditions inside the blood vessels until extravasating into a distant tissue for metastatic colonization. To investigate whether RhoA also suppresses the later steps of the metastasis cascade, we tail-vein injected RhoA knockdown or control knockdown 4T1 GFP-LUC cells in Balb/c mice to bypass the early stages of metastasis. Mice were monitored at days 1, 7 and 14 post-injection for lung tumor burden by bioluminescent imaging. As shown in Fig.\u00a03c,d, both the kinetics of lung tumor formation and extent of the tumor burden showed no significant difference between RhoA knockdown and control group mice suggesting that RhoA may not have a role in cancer cell extravasation and colonization.RhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion by modulating the tumor microenvironmentRhoA modulates the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in breast tumors.

It is possible that reduced RhoA expression promotes cancer cell dissemination into sentinel lymph nodes by modulating this dynamic interplay. To investigate this hypothesis, we assessed the major TME components in the control and RhoA knockdown primary tumors harvested from the Balb/c mice 30 days after the orthotopic implantation. TME is mainly composed of activated fibroblasts called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), adaptive and innate immune cells, and vascular endothelial cells. We examined the presence of vascular endothelial cells, CAFs, B-lymphocytes and macrophages in these primary tumors by IHC staining with CD31, \u03b1-SMA, CD19, and F4/80 specific antibodies, respectively. Though no differences were detected in CD31 and CD19 expression between the two groups, a significant elevation was detected in \u03b1-SMA and F4/80 expression in RhoA knockdown tumors compared to control tumors, suggesting an increased infiltration of CAFs and macrophages in RhoA knockdown tumors, respectively (Fig.\u00a04a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03).CAFs are known to drive the tumorigenesis and metastasis phenotype by secreting pro-tumorigenic chemokines, and by enhancing tumor stiffness. While we did not detect any significant differences in collagen content/fibrosis between control and RhoA knockdown tumors as measured by Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, IHC staining with pro-tumorigenic chemokine CXCL12 specific antibody revealed that RhoA knockdown tumors are significantly enriched in CXCL12 expression (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). To identify the source of CXCL12 in the TME, we double-stained the RhoA knockdown tumors with \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 antibodies. We observed that the CXCL12 staining was predominantly co-localized with the staining of \u03b1-SMA suggesting that CXCL12 detected in the TME was mainly secreted by the infiltrated CAFs (Fig.\u00a04c). In agreement with this line of thinking, we failed to detect the expression of CXCL12 in 4T1 cells by qRT-PCR (data not shown). The predominant receptor for CXCL12 is CXCR4. As expected, the expression levels of CXCR4 were also enhanced in RhoA knockdown tumors as measured by IHC staining and qRT-PCR RNA analysis (Fig.\u00a04d,e). Apparently, the enhanced CXCR4 expression is an autonomous effect of the downregulation of RhoA expression in 4T1 cancer cells (Fig.\u00a04e).RhoA modulates the CCR5-CCL5 axis in breast tumors.

During tumor progression, secretion of tumor-derived chemoattractant chemokines leads to the recruitment of circulating monocytes into breast tumors. The infiltrated monocytes will subsequently differentiate into tumor associated-macrophages. It is possible that the increased number of TAMs is a consequence of increased expression of CCL5 in RhoA knockdown tumors. Truly, RhoA knockdown tumors were significantly enriched in CCL5 expression (Fig.\u00a05a). In addition to secreting CXCL12, CAFs have also been shown to be a key source of CCL5 in tumors. Indeed, CAFs but not the cancer cells, are the major contributors of CCL5 in RhoA knockdown tumors as assessed by immunofluorescent staining and qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a05b,c).Paracrine activities of intra-tumoral CCL5 through its cognate receptor CCR5 are reported to promote breast tumor progression, and LN and thoracic metastasis. It is possible that the observed increase in LN and lung metastases in RhoA knockdown mice is caused by activated CCL5-CCR5 signaling in primary tumors. In agreement with this line of reasoning, we observed the expression levels of CCR5 were increased in RhoA knockdown tumors and the increased CCR5 expression levels are partly due to an increase in CCR5 transcripts in cancer cells (Fig.\u00a05d,e).DiscussionIn this study, we investigated the role of RhoA in breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Stable knockdown of RhoA expression had no effect on breast cancer cell proliferation but increased in vitro cell invasion and metastasis. The reported effects of RhoA shRNA-mediated knockdown on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro are mixed. While we and others observed that RhoA has an anti-invasive role, published reports indicating that RhoA has a pro-invasive role in breast cancer exist. At present, the mechanism of how RhoA can have opposite effects on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro is not known. RhoA GTPase has several downstream effectors and some of them reported to have opposing effects on cancer cells invasion. Therefore, it is plausible that, depending on the experimental conditions, knocking down the expression of RhoA can have preferred effects on certain downstream RhoA effectors. However, despite the described opposite effects of RhoA on in vitro breast cancer cells invasion, the effects of specific RhoA shRNA knockdown on breast cancer metastasis has never been formally addressed with an orthotopic transplantation immune-competent mouse model until now. The results of our in vitro invasion assays align rightly with the in vivo mouse experiments strongly suggesting the causal role of RhoA as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor. Among the various effectors, mDia and ROCK are two best-described effectors that are important for RhoA-mediated regulation of cancer cell invasion/metastasis by stabilizing adherens junctions, regulating myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) phosphorylation and focal adhesion dynamics. It remains to be determined if RhoA inhibits breast cancer cell metastasis by targeting adherens junctions, MLC2 phosphorylation, and/or focal adhesions.In addition to cancer cell-autonomous functions, continuous heterotypic communications between cancer cells, ECM, and their surrounding non-malignant cells are also vital for disease progression and metastatic dissemination. Fibroblasts are the most common non-malignant cells in the tumor. In normal tissues, they usually exist in a resting/quiescent state and are activated in response to a plethora of signaling cues. Activated fibroblasts are highly proliferative and metabolically active and identified by their expression of markers like \u03b1-SMA and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). Activated fibroblasts in tumor stroma are termed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally pro-tumorigenic with a dynamic and complex secretory phenotype including ECM molecules (tenascin C, collagen), growth factors (VEGFA, PDGF, HGF), cytokines, and chemokines (TNF, IFN\u03b3, CXCL12, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8). Using the 4T1 triple negative breast cancer mouse model, we observed an inverse correlation between RhoA expression and infiltration of \u03b1-SMA positive CAFs. Consistent with increased infiltrated CAFs, RhoA knockdown tumors were also highly enriched with CAFs-secreted CXCL12. The reduced RhoA activity resulted in increased expression of the cognate receptor, CXCR4, for CXCL12 in 4T1 cancer cells.CAFs-secreted CXCL12 drives tumor progression and metastasis through two possible mechanisms. It mediates the chemotactic recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to promote tumor angiogenesis. It may also enhance the invasive capacity of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells through paracrine stimulation. Since RhoA knockdown had no observable effect on tumor angiogenesis, it is possible that the increased CXCL12 expression might drive the paracrine stimulation of the RhoA knockdown cancer cells\u2019 invasiveness. Therefore, our study suggests that RhoA suppresses breast cancer cell metastatic dissemination by suppressing the invasiveness of tumor cells through reduced expression of the tumor CXCR4 receptor with a subsequent reduction of CAFs in the TME.Similarly, RhoA knockdown primary tumors displayed a significant F4/80 positive macrophage infiltration. This was correlated with an increased expression of stromal-derived CCL5, a well-established chemokine important in recruiting and converting CCR5 positive monocytes into TAMs. In addition to CCR5, monocytes also express CCR2, which is the main receptor for another important immune cell recruiting chemokine CCL2. The expression of CCR5, the cognate receptor for CCL5 was likewise found to be upregulated in RhoA knockdown 4T1 cancer cells. However, the effects of RhoA knockdown on CCR2 expression is not as significant as the effects on CCR5 (unpublished results). It is therefore possible that the upregulation of CCR5 but not CCR2 expression is the major cause of increased F4/80 positive macrophage infiltration in RhoA knockdown tumors. In addition to CXCL12, CAFs were also a source of increased CCL5 expression in RhoA knockdown tumors. It is therefore likely that the increased co-expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 in RhoA knockdown cancer cells facilitates the recruitment of CXCL12/CCL5 secreting CAFs and later the TAMs into the TME. Like CAFs, TAMs have been shown to be pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic. Since RhoA knockdown tumors with significant CAFs and TAMs infiltration showed relatively increased lymph node and lung metastases formation, it is therefore possible that reduced RhoA activity in tumor cells promotes its metastatic dissemination by activating both the CXCL12-CXCR4 and CCL5-CCR5 signaling pathways.Metastatic dissemination and distant colonization are inefficient processes with multiple sequential steps. The systemic metastasis of breast cancer was long thought to be through the intratumoral and peritumoral blood vasculature, even though lymph node metastasis was often associated with tumor aggressiveness and poorer prognosis. It was long believed that LN metastases enter systemic circulation by traveling from SLN to the next through efferent lymphatics until they drain into the thoracic duct and through the neck lympho-vascular anastomosis into the internal jugular vein. However, recent studies using intravital imaging, photo-switchable protein, and cancer cell micro-infusion showed that cancer cells in the SLN are a significant source for distant lung metastases and lymph node-residing tumor cells disseminate by efficiently invading LN blood vasculature rather than by transiting through efferent lymphatic vessels. In the present study, we detected more cancer cells in the SLNs but not in the contralateral lymph nodes of RhoA knockdown mice compared to the control group. Cancer cells tail-vein injection experiments designed to bypass the early steps revealed no difference in cancer cells extravasation and lung colonization between RhoA knockdown and control groups. Taken together, our study suggest that RhoA suppresses the cancer cells\u2019 initial steps of local invasion into SLNs, and subsequent intravasation into LN blood vasculature while has no observable role in the later steps of the metastasis cascade.Knockdown of RhoA expression increases CCR5 and CXCR4 transcripts in 4T1 cancer cells suggesting a possible transcription-regulatory function of RhoA. RhoA GTPases are known for its functions in cytoskeleton dynamics, regulating cell polarity and cell migration and cell cycle progression. However, a lesser-known function of RhoA is its ability to regulate several transcriptional signaling pathways such as NF\u03baB signaling, GATA-4 signaling, CREB signaling, STAT5a signaling and AP-1 signaling. Rho regulates the transcriptional activity of NF\u03baB by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and in breast and prostate cancer cells, NF\u03baB directly upregulates CXCR4 mRNA expression and stability. Although NF-\u03baB has a stimulatory role in regulating chemokines expression in general, it is still conceivable that RhoA negatively regulates NF-\u03baB by decreasing the expression of coactivators required for optimal activity of NF-\u03baB. Similarly, it was also reported that Rho GTPases could modulate the activity of CREB, and CCR5 is a well-established transcriptional target of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Therefore, it is possible that RhoA suppresses CCR5 and CXCR4 expression by impinging on one or more of these transcriptional signaling pathways. In a recent study, Georgouli et al. reported the pivotal role of RhoA-ROCK signaling in driving fast rounded-amoeboid migration in cancer cells during metastasis in a melanoma mouse model. Mechanistically upregulation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway in melanoma cancer cells stimulates the transcription and secretion of an entire cytokine transcriptional program that controls immune cell recruitment into the tumor environment. At present, it is not clear whether the pro-metastatic effect of RhoA is RhoA-effector or cancer type specific.In summary, using a triple negative breast cancer mouse model, we demonstrated that reduced RhoA expression increases breast cancer lymph node and lung metastasis. Potential tumor and metastasis suppressive ability of RhoA in breast cancer have been suggested before. But the current study demonstrated that this is achieved by promoting a pro-tumor microenvironment, with increased CAF and macrophage infiltration, and by modulating the CCL5-CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axes at the primary tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first such mechanistic study in breast cancer, shows the ability of RhoA to suppresses chemokine receptor expression in breast tumor cells, in turn suppressing the breast cancer LN and lung metastasis.Materials and MethodsCell cultureBT20 and MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, HyClone, UT, USA) with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, GA, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (HyClone), and the 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line was cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS, 5% calf serum (Lonza, Switzerland) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

Briefly, ten random fields of view (FOV) were captured from each tumor section while avoiding necrotic and non-tumor areas. Positive signal area or positive number of cells were measured using the ImageJ for each FOV. The average positive signal area or positive number of cells were reported as positive area or positive number of cell per tumor FOV. For co-localization studies, after primary antibody incubation, sections were incubated with corresponding Alexa Fluor\u00ae secondary antibodies (1:2000, 1\u2009hour, ThermoFisher) and DRAQ5\u00ae (1:2000, 10\u2009minutes, Cell Signaling, MA, USA) nuclear stain.

Our results show potential in modulating uptake and retention of GNPs among key components of TME, in an effort to develop NP-based strategies to suppress the tumor growth. An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs. Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. In panel a, the first column shows the distribution of lysosomes while the second column shows the merged image of lysosomes plus MTs. In panel b, the first, second, and third columns show the distribution of NPs, lysosomes, and merged image of lysosomes, MTs, and NPs, respectivelyQuantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular retention of GNPPEG-RGD. a Quantitative data representing percent of retention of NPs. The cells were first incubated with NPs over a time period of 24\u00a0h followed by another incubation for 24\u00a0h in fresh media to determine the extent of NP retention. b Redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell among two daughter cells during cell division. c Confocal images of HeLa (first row), FBs (second row), and CAFs (third row) displaying distribution of GNPs (first column; marked in red), MT network (second column, marked in green), and merged image (third column) corresponding to GNPs and MTs. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

        "content": "Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to promote tumor growth and progression. Our objective was to measure the effect of TGF-beta1 on fibroblasts isolated from invasive breast cancer patients. Fibroblasts were isolated from tissue obtained at surgery from patients with invasive breast cancer (CAF; n = 28) or normal reduction mammoplasty patients (normal; n = 10). Myofibroblast activation was measured by counting cells immunostained for smooth muscle alpha actin (ACTA2) in cultures +/- TGF-beta 1. Conditioned media (CM) was collected for invasion assays and RNA was isolated from cultures incubated in media +/- TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Q-PCR was used to measure expression of cyclin D1, fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, urokinase, stromelysin-1, and ACTA2 genes. Invasion rate was measured in chambers plated with MDA-MB-231 cells and exposed to CM in the bottom chamber; the number of cells that invaded into the bottom chamber was counted. Wilcox Rank Sum tests were used to evaluate differences in CAFs and normal fibroblasts and the effect of TGF-beta 1. There was no difference in percent myofibroblasts or invasion rate between normal and CAF cultures. However, TGF-beta1 significantly increased the percent of myofibroblasts (P &lt; 0.01) and invasion rate (P = 0.02) in CAF cultures. Stromelysin-1 expression was significantly higher in normal versus CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). TGF-beta 1 significantly increased ACTA2 expression in both normal and CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). Expression of fibronectin and laminin was significantly increased by TGF-beta in CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). CAFs were measurably different from normal fibroblasts in response to TGF-beta 1, suggesting that TGF-beta stimulates changes in CAFs that foster tumor invasion.",
