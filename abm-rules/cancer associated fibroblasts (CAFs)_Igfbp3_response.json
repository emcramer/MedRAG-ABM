    "## Potential Rules for Igfbp3 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) Here are some potential rules for Igfbp3 in CAFs, based on the provided research papers: **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Igfbp3 increases with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4, upon contact with neoplastic epithelial cells. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can become activated upon encountering cancer cells, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This activated state can promote the growth and invasion of the tumor. Igfbp3 is known to be upregulated in activated CAFs (Document [16]). **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Igfbp3 decreases with a Hill response, with half-max 0.2 and Hill power 4, upon exposure to inflammatory signals. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that inflammatory signals can suppress the activation of CAFs, potentially due to the immune response or other cellular processes. Igfbp3 is known to be downregulated in CAFs under inflammatory conditions (Document [16]). **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Igfbp3 increases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4, upon exposure to IGF-II. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that IGF-II can promote the activation of CAFs. Igfbp3 is known to be upregulated in CAFs upon IGF-II stimulation (Document [16]). **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Igfbp3 decreases transform to activated from 0.01 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.2 and Hill power 4, upon exposure to activin A. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that activin A can suppress the activation of CAFs. Igfbp3 is known to be downregulated in CAFs upon activin A stimulation (Document [4]). **Rule 5:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Igfbp3 increases the resistance to deformation from 0 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4, upon exposure to TGF-\u03b2. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that TGF-\u03b2 can promote the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which are more resistant to deformation. Igfbp3 is known to be upregulated in myofibroblasts (Document [18]). **Rule 6:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Igfbp3 decreases the rate of changing to each cell type from 0.01 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4, upon exposure to high oxygen tension. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that high oxygen tension can suppress the activation of CAFs. Igfbp3 is known to be downregulated in CAFs under high oxygen tension (Document [2]). **Rule 7:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Igfbp3 increases the rate of fusing with each cell type from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10, upon contact with dead cells. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can be re-educated towards the M1 phenotype upon encountering dead cells. This can lead to increased tumor cell killing. Igfbp3 is known to be upregulated in M1 macrophages (Document [2]). **Note:** These rules are based on the information provided in the research papers and are intended to be a starting point for building an agent-based model. The specific parameters and values used in the rules can be adjusted based on the specific tumor model and the available data. "
