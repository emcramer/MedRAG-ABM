    "## Potential Rules for Ncam1 in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Ncam1 increases migration speed. **Justification:** Ncam1 (also known as CD56 or L1-CAM) is a cell adhesion molecule that has been shown to be involved in cell migration and invasion in various cell types, including cancer cells. While the documents provided don't directly address Ncam1 expression in CAFs, they do highlight the importance of cell-cell interactions and migration in tumor progression. [Document 12] and [Document 13] specifically mention the role of cell adhesion molecules in promoting migration and invasion of cancer cells. Therefore, it is plausible that Ncam1 could play a similar role in CAFs, promoting their migration and contributing to tumor growth and spread. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, contact with neoplastic epithelial cells increases Ncam1 expression. **Justification:** [Document 12] and [Document 13] highlight the reciprocal influence of cancer cells and fibroblasts on various features related to invasiveness. This suggests that cancer cells may release signals that induce changes in CAF behavior, including the expression of adhesion molecules like Ncam1. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that contact with neoplastic epithelial cells could trigger an increase in Ncam1 expression in CAFs. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, inflammatory signal decreases Ncam1 expression. **Justification:** [Document 7] and [Document 10] discuss the role of CAFs in creating an immunosuppressive environment and attracting immune cells. This suggests that inflammatory signals, which are often associated with immune responses, could potentially downregulate Ncam1 expression in CAFs. This could be a mechanism to reduce CAF migration towards inflammatory sites and potentially limit their contribution to tumor growth. **Note:** These rules are based on inferences from the provided documents and require further investigation and validation. The specific mechanisms by which Ncam1 might influence CAF behavior in the context of triple-negative breast cancer need to be explored through additional research. "
