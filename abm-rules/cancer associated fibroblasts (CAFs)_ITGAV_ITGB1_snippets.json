Taken together, these data provide new insights into the role of miR-9 as an important player in the cross-talk between cancer cells and stroma.Tumorigenesis is not considered anymore a tumor cell-autonomous mechanism triggered by accumulation of somatic aberrations, but fostered by a two-way interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment.Cancer cells are indeed integrated in a biologically complex stroma, composed of different cell types (such as immune system components, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes) as well as extracellular matrix (ECM), which originates the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

        "content": "Integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) overexpression in cancer cells contributes to cancer progression. However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results.

Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

D. Quantification of Col1 fiber volume and fiber distribution in lung nodules. Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

        "content": "Tumor initiation and progression are not only ascribed to the behavior of cancer cells, but also profoundly influenced by the tumor microenvironment. Inside, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have become key factors to accelerate growth and metastasis for the abundance in most solid tumors. Our group previously reported that Oroxylin A (OA), a flavone from Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi, possess the ability to suppress growth and invasion of several tumor cells. However, the regulatory effect of OA on stromal microenvironment is poorly understood. In this study, breast cancer-induced fibroblasts and primary breast CAFs from MMTV-PyMT mice were used to evaluate the influence of OA on the activation of fibroblasts. Results showed that OA could decrease the expression of \u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Thus, OA-deactivated CAFs did not further promote the proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. In vivo experiments, OA could also impede tumor metastasis through exhausting progressive CAFs. Mechanically, OA could specifically bind ACTN1 and significantly inhibit its expression to prevent CAF activation. As a consequence, OA could decrease the phosphorylation of FAK and STAT3, and reduce the secretion of CCL2 in CAFs. Altogether, OA could remodel stromal microenvironment and it is a potential therapeutic agent in breast cancer.",

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

        "title": "Stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduces interstitial fluid pressure and perturbs collagen structure in triple-negative breast xenograft tumors.",
        "content": "Cancer progression is influenced by a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. The aberrant tumor stroma with increased collagen deposition, contractile fibroblasts and dysfunctional vessels has a major impact on the interstitial fluid pressure (PIF) in most solid tumors. An increased tumor PIF is a barrier to the transport of interstitial fluid into and within the tumor. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate pressure homeostasis can lead to new insight into breast tumor progression, invasion and response to therapy. The collagen binding integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is upregulated during myofibroblast differentiation and expressed on fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. As a collagen organizer and a probable link between contractile fibroblasts and the complex collagen network in tumors, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 could be a potential regulator of tumor PIF. We investigated the effect of stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency on pressure homeostasis, collagen organization and tumor growth using orthotopic and ectopic triple-negative breast cancer xenografts (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) in wild type and integrin \u03b111-deficient mice. PIF was measured by the wick-in-needle technique, collagen by Picrosirius Red staining and electron microscopy, and uptake of radioactively labeled 5FU by microdialysis. Further, PIF in heterospheroids composed of MDA-MB-231 cells and wild type or integrin \u03b111-deficient fibroblasts was measured by micropuncture.

The aberrant tumor stroma with increased collagen deposition, contractile fibroblasts and dysfunctional vessels has a major impact on the interstitial fluid pressure (PIF) in most solid tumors. An increased tumor PIF is a barrier to the transport of interstitial fluid into and within the tumor. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate pressure homeostasis can lead to new insight into breast tumor progression, invasion and response to therapy. The collagen binding integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is upregulated during myofibroblast differentiation and expressed on fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. As a collagen organizer and a probable link between contractile fibroblasts and the complex collagen network in tumors, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 could be a potential regulator of tumor PIF.MethodsWe investigated the effect of stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency on pressure homeostasis, collagen organization and tumor growth using orthotopic and ectopic triple-negative breast cancer xenografts (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) in wild type and integrin \u03b111-deficient mice. PIF was measured by the wick-in-needle technique, collagen by Picrosirius Red staining and electron microscopy, and uptake of radioactively labeled 5FU by microdialysis. Further, PIF in heterospheroids composed of MDA-MB-231 cells and wild type or integrin \u03b111-deficient fibroblasts was measured by micropuncture.ResultsStromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency decreased PIF in both the orthotopic breast cancer models.

Our data suggest that integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a pro-tumorigenic effect on triple-negative breast cancer growth in vivo.

Despite significant advancements in the treatment of other breast cancer subtypes, there is still no licensed targeted therapy available for the treatment of TNBC, and therefore little improvement in survival has been observed for this patient population over the last years. This highlights the need for better understanding of TNBC and identification of mechanisms involved in disease progression and treatment response.It is now well recognized that breast cancer progression can be influenced by a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment surrounding the malignant epithelial cells. This environment consists of a heterogeneous mixture of stromal cells, including a diversity of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a biological active network comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM), in addition to the interstitial fluid and its solutes. New knowledge about the components of the microenvironment and how they interact with tumor cells can hopefully identify new biomarkers or potential targets in TNBC.The aberrant stroma affects the physiological forces within the tumor. Indeed, the hydrostatic pressure in the tumor interstitium, known as interstitial fluid pressure (PIF), is considerably increased in the majority of solid tumors, including human breast cancer, and this poses a major physiological barrier to transport of soluble factors within the tumor.Increased PIF has been shown to predict poor prognosis in some solid tumors, and can also hinder effective delivery of drugs into the tumor. Finding ways to lower tumor PIF may therefore increase efficiency of cancer therapy.Fibroblasts can actively modify PIF and transcapillary fluid exchange (reviewed in) and the molecular mechanisms are outlined by collagen contraction assays and heterospheroids, as well as parallel in vivo experiments. Dysfunctional blood and lymph vessels will lead to fluid accumulation in the tumor interstitium, and swelling of hyaluronan and proteoglycans would in normal conditions hinder an increase in PIF. Tension exerted by fibroblasts and collagen network can probably counteract this swelling, resulting in a persistent increased PIF. However, although fibroblast-mediated contraction has previous been shown to be dependent on \u03b21-integrins, fibroblast-mediated PIF influence is still not fully understood.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is a collagen binding integrin expressed during differentiation of myofibroblasts and is involved in collagen organization and tumor stiffness. As a collagen organizer and a link between contractile fibroblasts and the complex collagen network, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 could be a regulator of tumor PIF. Although a few studies indicate that it has a physiological role in the regulation of PIF in dermis, its influence on PIF in tumors remains to be demonstrated. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate pressure homeostasis within a tumor, can probably lead to a new insight into breast carcinogenesis, and we therefore investigated the effect of stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency on pressure homeostasis, ECM organization and tumor growth using two human TNBC xenograft models.MethodsCell linesMDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) was provided by Professor James Lorens (University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway), and MDA-MB-468 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-132\u2122) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA., USA). The MDA-MB-231 cells were fingerprinted before use and matched with the cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) in the ATCC database. MDA-MB-231 was used at passage number five to nine, while the MDA-MB-468 cells were used at passage number two to five. These TNBC cell lines have high tumor take in SCID mice and slowly forming tumors, which may be more stromal dependent than more rapidly growing xenografts. Wild type (WT) and integrin \u03b111-deficient (\u03b111-KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from mouse embryos of embryonic day 14.5 as described previously. In order to obtain immortalized MEFs, primary MEF cultures were infected with recombinant retrovirus-transducing simian virus 40 (SV40). All cell lines were grown in Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum, 100\u2009units/ml penicillin, 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 1\u20132% L-glutamine (all from Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were grown as single monolayers in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and in all experiments used at log phase. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.Xenograft modelsThe integrin \u03b111-deficient heterozygous SCID mouse strain was generated as previously described. PCR-genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from ear biopsies. The animals were kept in individually ventilated cages, cared for regularly and efforts were made to age- and weight match the animals. All animal experiments were approved by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Permit Number 20168751) which is the competent body responsible for authorizing research projects in animals in Norway. This is in accordance with the EU directive 2010/63 article 36.A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 or 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-468 tumor cells in 0.15\u2009ml PBS were injected into the fourth mammary fat pad (orthotopic), and for the MDA-MB-231 also subcutaneously on the mouse flank (ectopic). Tumor size was measured using a caliper. The tumor volume was calculated using the formula; tumor volume (mm3)\u2009=\u2009(\u03c0/6)\u2009\u00d7\u2009a2\u00a0\u00d7\u2009b, where a represents the shortest diameter and b represents the longest diameter of the tumor. All animals were anesthetized using Isofluran (Isoba\u00aevet. 100%, Schering-Plough A/S, Farum, Denmark) and eventually sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia. For investigation of the primary tumor, all the MDA-MB-231 injected mice were sacrificed day 57 post injection. For the MDA-MB-468 injected mice, some of the tumors showed tendency to ulcerate the skin, and these mice were sacrificed immediately. To make the groups comparable, one mouse from the opposite group and with similar tumor load was sacrificed on the same day.To evaluate metastatic spread to the lungs, they were processed and fixed as previously described (n\u2009=\u20095 WT and 5 \u03b111-KO and n\u2009=\u20095 WT and 4 \u03b111-KO for the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 injected mice, respectively).All measurements and analysis in this study were performed blinded to genotype.Measurement of interstitial fluid pressureThe wick-in-needle technique was used to measure the tumor PIF. Briefly, a standard 23-gauge needle with a side hole filled with nylon floss and saline was connected to a PE-50 catheter, a pressure transducer and a computer for pressure registrations, using the software Powerlab chart (version 5, PowerLab/ssp. AD instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). The needle was inserted into the central part of the tumor after calibration. After a period of stable pressure measurements, the fluid communication was tested by clamping the catheter which shall cause a transient rise and then return to pressure prior to clamping. Measurements were accepted if the pre- to post-clamping value was within \u00b11\u2009mmHg.PIF in heterospheroids was measured with the micropuncture technique described previously. Briefly, the spheroids were collected and transferred to 10-cm Lysine-coated cell culture dishes (Nunc, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA., USA) and left to attach for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. PIF was measured using sharpened glass capillaries (tip diameter 3\u20135\u2009\u03bcm) connected to a servo-controlled counter pressure system. The glass capillaries were filled with hypertonic saline (0.5\u2009M) colored with Evans blue dye and inserted into the central parts of the spheroid with the help of a stereomicroscope (Wild M5, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). PIF in the cell culture medium directly outside the spheroid was defined as the zero reference pressure.Electron microscopy of collagen fibrils in the tumorTumor samples were taken from the tumor periphery and were fixed and processed as previously described. A JEM-1230 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the diameter and organization of the collagen fibrils, and images from four to six different areas of the tissue were analyzed. Pictures were captured at \u00d7\u2009100,000 magnification and analyzed using Image J 1.46 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., USA) to measure the fibril diameter. To investigate the organization of the collagen fibrils, pictures were captured at \u00d7\u200930,000 magnification and scored from one to four considering collagen fibril organization and alignment within the collagen fibers.A JSM-7400F Scanning Electron microscope (Jeol) was used to study the tumor collagen fibril scaffold architecture. Five images from different areas of the tumor were captured from each tumor at \u00d7\u200910,000 magnification.Immunostaining and Picrosirius-red stainingHistological analysis was performed on both paraffin embedded sections and cryosections. For paraffin embedded sections, 5\u2009\u03bcm thick sections were deparaffinizated and rehydrated, followed by heat induced antigen retrieval at pH\u20096 (#S1699, Dako, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA., USA) for Ki67 (100\u2009\u00b0C, 20\u2009min) and \u03b1SMA (100\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009min), pH\u20099 (#2367, Dako) for Coll III (100\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009min) or pH\u200910 (#T6455, Sigma Aldrich) for PDGFR\u03b2 (110\u2009\u00b0C, 5\u2009min). After antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated with peroxidase block (#K006, Dako) and then primary antibody. Envision+ System-HRP (#K4006 or #K4010, Dako) was used as secondary antibody, in addition to rabbit anti-goat for collagen III (1:1000, #6164\u201301, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL., USA), and DAB was used as chromogen, except for \u03b1SMA staining, where a FITC-conjugated antibody was used. Analysis of immunohistochemistry was performed using Leica DN 2000 Led (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The following primary antibodies were used on paraffin sections: rabbit anti-mouse PDGFR\u03b2 mAb (1:100, #3169, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA., USA), goat anti-mouse Type III Collagen pAb (1:100, #1330\u201308, Southern Biotech), anti-mouse \u03b1SMA mAb (F3777, dilution 1:200, Sigma Aldrich) and mouse anti-human Ki67 mAb (1:100, #M7240, Dako).Cryosections with a thickness of 6\u2009\u03bcm were fixed in ice-cold methanol (\u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C, 8\u2009min) and rehydrated with PBS, followed by blocking with 10% goat serum. Afterwards, the following primary antibodies were supplied: rabbit anti-mouse integrin \u03b111 pAb (1:200, custom-made, Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden,), mouse anti-human cytokerain AE1/AE3 mAb (1:200, #M3515, Dako) and mouse anti \u03b1SMA mAb (1:200, #A5228, Sigma Aldrich). Goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (1:400, #111\u2013585-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ink., West Grove, PA., USA) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:400, #315\u2013545-045, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. Mounting was done with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (#P36934, ThermoFisher). The staining results were evaluated under an Axioscope fluorescence microscope and micrographs were acquired using a digital AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Picrosirius-red stain (Polysciences inc, Warrington, FL., USA) was used for a semi-quantitative measurement of collagen type I and III as previously described.Evaluation of the stainingFor Picrosirius-red, collagen III, PDGFR\u03b2 and \u03b1SMA, a total of four to six pictures were captured from each tumor with \u00d7\u2009100 magnification. Images were taken in the tumor periphery in order to avoid the necrotic central area. The software Image J 1.46 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., USA) was used to identify the amount of positive pixels.For Ki67, the tumors were examined using light microscopy with an eye-piece grid at \u00d7\u2009630 magnification. A total of 500 tumor cells from the tumor periphery were evaluated, and distinct nuclear staining regardless of intensity was registered as positive. Areas with necrosis, bleeding or inflammation were avoided.MicrodialysisMicrodialysis was performed as previously described on the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors. Briefly, after anesthesia with Ketalar (Pfizer Inc., NY., USA) and Dormitor (Orin Pharma AS, Espoo, Finland), one microdialysis probe was placed in the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumor (CMA12 Elite Microdialysis probe, ref.nr 8,010,434) and one in the jugular vein (CMA12 Elite Metal free, ref.nr 80,111,204). The probes were connected to a PE-50 catheter, perfused by a pump (CMA100 Microinjection pump, ref.nr 8,210,040) at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcl/min and left to stabilize for 30\u2009min. After intravenous injection of 0.15\u2009ml 0.65\u2009MBq 3H-5FU (Nycomed Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), dialysate was sampled and pooled every 10\u2009min for a total of 90\u2009min. Scintillation counting solution (Optiphase Hisafe 3, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA., USA) was added, and the radioactivity measured using a liquid scintillation analyzer (Tri-Carb 2900TR, PerkinElmer, Inc.). The probes and pump were delivered by CMA Microdialysis AB, Kista, Sweden.The area under the curve (AUC) for the plasma and tumor was calculated with Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA., USA) as the total radioactivity collected, i.e. as the product of radioactivity (counts per minute) and time. Finally, transport of 3H-5FU was expressed as AUC tumor divided by AUC plasma.After each experiment, the probes were tested in saline with a known amount of 3H-5FU, and experiments with probes that differed more than 15% in permeability were excluded.HeterospheroidsHeterospheroids containing a mixture of SV40-immortalized MEFs and MDA-MB-231 cells were prepared using the hanging drop method as described previously. Briefly, sub-confluent cells were trypsinized and suspended in culture medium to a concentration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/ml. The MEFs (WT or integrin \u03b111-KO MEFs) and MDA-MB-231 cell suspensions were then mixed at a ratio of 4:1 to make WT MEFs + MDA-MB-231 and \u03b111-KO MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids. Approximately 40 drops (25\u2009\u03bcl/ drop, 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/drop) were dispensed onto a lid of a cell culture dish. The lid was then inverted and placed over a cell culture dish containing medium for humidity, and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 5\u2009days.Statistical analysisSigmaplot 13.0 (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL., USA) and Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software) were used for statistical analysis. Either the unpaired two-tailed t-test or the Mann- Whitney U test, was used to analyze statistical differences between the two groups. Results were accepted as statistically different when p\u2009<\u20090.05. Data are given as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, and number of measurements (n) refers to number of tumors or heterospheroids unless otherwise specified.ResultsEffect of stromal integrin \u03b111\u03b21 on breast tumor growthTumor growth. The growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (a-c) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice. A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 and 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 MDA-MB-468 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad, and for MDA-MB-231, also subcutaneously (s.c.) on the back. All MDA-MB-231 injected mice were sacrificed at day 57 post injection. The MDA-MB-468 injected mice were sacrificed at different time points starting with n\u2009=\u200920 WT and n\u2009=\u200916 \u03b111-KO. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. ** p\u2009<\u20090.01. Immunofluorescence staining of integrin \u03b111 (red), cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (green) and DAPI (blue) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (d) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice. Scale bars indicate 50\u2009\u03bcmMDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 tumor cells were injected into WT and \u03b111-KO mice. As expected, we found that integrin \u03b111 was expressed in the tumor stroma in WT mice, but not in \u03b111-KO mice (Fig.\u00a01d). Furthermore, the immunofluorescent staining of integrin \u03b111 (Fig. 1d) did not show differences in the amount of integrin \u03b111 expression between the MDA-MB-231 orthotropic and subcutaneous model (n\u2009=\u20093\u20135). The tumor volumes in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors were significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in \u03b111-KO mice compared to tumors grown in WT mice during their 57\u2009days growth period (Fig. 1a). A clear tendency towards reduced MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumor growth was also seen, but this did not reach statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.059) (Fig. 1b). Of note, there was no difference in MDA-MB-231 tumor growth when the cells were injected subcutaneously on the back (Fig. 1c).Tumor cell proliferation.

However, in the two other tumor models, there were no significant differences in number of proliferating tumor cells (Fig. 2b-d).Integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduces tumor interstitial fluid pressureTumor interstitial fluid pressure.

PIF was significantly reduced in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors grown in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT (Fig.\u00a03a-b). No difference in PIF was seen in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 3c).Integrin \u03b111-deficiency perturbs collagen structureCollagen amount. The total fraction of Picrosirius-red and collagen III positive staining quantified in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice showed no differences (n\u2009=\u20096 in both models).

Transmission electron microscopy pictures from the xenograft tumors were scored from 1 to 4 according to collagen organization. The average collagen organization score per tumor in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) were lower in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT (n\u2009=\u20098 WT and n\u2009=\u20097 \u03b111-KO mice in both models). No difference was found in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (c) (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. * p\u2009<\u20090.05, ** p\u2009<\u20090.01.

Scale bars indicate 0.5\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril diameter. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze collagen fibrils. Collagen fibril diameter distribution and average fibril diameter per tumor in MDA-MB-231 (n\u2009=\u20097) (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (n\u2009=\u20097) (b) showed a shift towards thinner fibrils in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT. No difference was seen in MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (c) (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. * p\u2009<\u20090.05.

Representative scanning electron images of collagen fibrils in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (n\u2009=\u20095 WT and n\u2009=\u20094 \u03b111-KO in both models). Scale bar indicates 1\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril organization and structure in the xenograft tumors were investigated using TEM. As seen in Fig.\u00a05a-b and d, integrin \u03b111-deficiency lead to more disorganized collagen fibril architecture with fewer aligned collagen fibrils in both the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumor models. In these tumors, there was also a shift towards thinner collagen fibrils in \u03b111-KO compared to WT mice (Fig. 6a-b and d). No difference was seen in either collagen fibril alignment or collagen fibril diameter in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors when comparing \u03b111-KO mice with WT (Figs. 5c and 6c). In addition, SEM did not demonstrate visual differences in the collagen fibril structure between tumors grown in \u03b111-KO mice versus WT (Fig. 7).\u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2. The total fraction of \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2 positive staining quantified in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice showed no differences (n\u2009=\u20096 in both models). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Immunofluorescence staining of integrin \u03b111 (red), \u03b1SMA (green) and DAPI (blue) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (c). Scale bars indicate 50\u2009\u03bcmImmunostaining of \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2, common markers of activated fibroblasts and pericytes, was used to quantify the relative amount of activated fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. Although integrin \u03b111 partially co-localized with \u03b1SMA in xenograft tumors in WT mice (Fig. 8c), no significant differences in the amount of PDGFR\u03b2 or \u03b1SMA expression (Fig. 8a-b and Additional file 1: Figure S1) in tumors in \u03b111-KO compared to WT mice were found.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 does not affect uptake of 3H-5FUMicrodialysis. Dialysate was sampled for 90\u2009min after i.v. injection of 3H-5FU, and the ratio between 3H-5FU level in plasma and in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumor was calculated as Area Under Curve (AUC). There was no significant difference in uptake when WT and \u03b111-KO mice were compared (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDThe reduced tumor PIF found in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors in \u03b111-KO mice was not associated with increased uptake of 3H-5FU measured by microdialysis (Fig. 9).Pressure homeostasis and integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in heterospheroidsHeterospheroids. The individual interstitial fluid pressures (PIF) in heterospheroids containing a mixture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells (4:1) (a). \u03b111-KO MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids showed a significant reduction in PIF compared to WT MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids. *** p\u2009<\u20090.001. Transmission electron microscopy images show collagen fibrils in both heterospheroid types (b)Since the in vivo results demonstrate that stromal integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a role in maintaining pressure homeostasis in triple-negative breast xenograft tumors, we also investigated the isolated effect of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts on tumor PIF in a simplified system. Spheroids composed of fibroblasts lacking integrin \u03b111 grown together with MDA-MB-231 cells had significantly lower PIF compared to spheroids with MDA-MB-231 cells and WT fibroblasts (Fig. 10a-b). These data indicate that the difference in PIF is, at least in part, due to integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts.Tumor metastasesNo lung metastases were seen when investigating coronal HE stained sections from lungs at end stage.DiscussionIntegrins are essential adhesion receptors necessary for intercellular communication, attachment of cells to the ECM and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we have demonstrated that stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency markedly decreased PIF in vivo using two orthotopic human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. A perturbed collagen structure was seen, with fewer aligned and thinner collagen fibrils. Furthermore, integrin \u03b111-deficiency impeded orthotopic breast tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 model, and the same trend was also found in the MDA-MB-468 orthotopic model. By investigating the isolated effect of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts on MDA-MB-231 tumor cells in vitro, we provide here evidence that PIF regulation is, at least partly, mediated by integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has arisen as a possible marker of a pro-tumorigenic subset of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. It has been found to be overexpressed in the stroma of lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Further, it stimulates lung cancer cell growth in vitro, and lung and prostate cancer growth in vivo. However, its role in tumor growth and progression is still not clear, especially in breast tumors where we recently reported that it did not affect the growth of the murine TNBC cell line 4\u2009T1 in vivo.In the present study, we found that stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to reduced tumor PIF in both orthotopic xenograft models. This demonstrates for the first time that integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a role in maintaining an elevated PIF in solid tumors. A dense ECM, contractile fibroblasts, leaky blood vessels and dysfunctional lymphatic drainage are possible causes of increased PIF in tumors. PIF can be actively modulated through interactions between contractile fibroblasts and ECM molecules, where fibroblasts have been proposed to normally exert a tension on the collagen network through collagen-binding integrins. Furthermore, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 contracts collagen matrices experimentally, and we therefore suggest that integrin \u03b111\u03b21-mediated PIF modifications can involve a contraction of the interstitial space mediated by direct or indirect binding of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts to collagen.The involvement of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts in tumor PIF homeostasis is supported by our study of heterospheroids, where we observed a similar PIF reduction in spheroids composed of MDA-MB-231 cells and integrin \u03b111-deficient fibroblasts. This simplified system allows us to investigate how fibroblasts grown together with tumor cells can influence PIF. In line with our results, a similar integrin \u03b111\u03b21 function in pressure regulation has previously been shown in fibroblasts/lung cancer heterospheroids. However, although these avascular spheroid studies indicate that the pressure regulatory abilities of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is, at least in part, mediated by integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts, the mechanisms behind integrin \u03b111-mediated effect on PIF in heterospheroids are not investigated in detail in this study. In addition, we cannot exclude additional factors in the more complex in vivo system, such as influence of the tumor vasculature, which has been shown to have an important impact on tumor PIF.Furthermore, integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to less organized and thinner collagen fibrils in the orthotopic models, which could be a contributing factor to reduced tumor PIF. Although it has been shown that the collagen-binding proteoglycan fibromodulin promotes the formation of a dense stroma and increased tumor PIF, it is nevertheless difficult to predict how different components in the extracellular matrix affect the hydraulic conductivity of tissues and thereby fluid flow and PIF.Although the present study is the first to identify integrin \u03b111\u03b21 as participating in regulation of pressure in solid tumors, it is already known to maintain a homeostatic PIF in dermis. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated the function of \u03b21-integrins in the regulation of dermal PIF by inhibiting \u03b21-integrins.Numerous studies have highlighted the role of CAFs in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis, either directly by stimulation of tumor cells via production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors or indirectly by for example remodeling the ECM (reviewed in). Here we show that integrin \u03b111\u03b21, known to be expressed during myofibroblast differentiation, seems to facilitate breast tumor growth in vivo.In previous studies, the pro-tumorigenic abilities of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 have been associated with increased matrix stiffness, collagen reorganization and increased levels of IGF-2. In the present study, changes in pressure homeostasis and collagen organization could both influence tumor growth and invasion. Of interest, increased tumor PIF has been linked to tumor aggressiveness in some human cancers, and is an independent poor prognostic factor in cervical cancer.There have been reports suggesting that increased tumor PIF can both facilitate and inhibit tumor progression. First, major pressure gradients due to increased tumor PIF can enhance interstitial fluid flow at and lymph drainage from the tumor margins, which probably increase the risk of cancer cells leaving the tumor. Increased flow can also facilitate tumor progression indirectly by either mechano-modulation of the tumor stroma or by changing the host immune response and thereby promote immunological tolerance (reviewed in). Further, in vitro elevation of tumor PIF increased proliferation of human osteosarcoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Similarly, in vivo lowering of tumor PIF, and thereby reduction of mechanical stretch for 24\u2009h, reduced tumor cell proliferation in vulva and lung xenograft tumors. However, contrary to these findings, increased tumor PIF may also limit uptake of nutrition and growth factors into the tumor and thereby inhibit tumor cell progression. In the context of breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 cells have actually been shown to invade towards regions of higher pressure in vitro, indicating that the elevated tumor PIF may in fact restrain breast tumor invasion. In summary, these findings demonstrate that maintenance of a high tumor PIF may be a contributing factor to integrin \u03b111\u03b21\u2019s pro-tumorigenic effects, but at the same time, it can have opposite effects during tumorigenesis, pinpointing the need for further preclinical investigation.Although increased tumor PIF can be a major barrier in cancer treatment, lowering of tumor PIF by integrin \u03b111-deficiency did not increase the uptake of the low molecular weight drug 3H-5FU into MDA-MB-231 tumor interstitium. Low molecular weight compounds are transported by both diffusion and bulk flow/convection, and we have previously shown that reducing PIF can increase the uptake of the small molecular weight drugs 3H-5FU and 51Cr-EDTA into the tumor interstitium. However, in parallel with the results in the present study, it is evident that lowering of PIF will not always increase the uptake of low molecular weight drugs. Similarily, Flessner et al. showed that decapsulation of ovarian xenografts markedly decreased PIF to zero, but did not increase penetration of the high molecular weight drug trastuzumab into the tumor. In summary, probably other features of the tumor microenvironment can also contribute to the failure of transport within solid tumors.Our data show that integrin \u03b111-deficiency leads to thinner and less organized collagen fibrils in the orthotopic tumor stroma. Changes in collagen composition and organization are already known to influence tumorigenesis and can predict breast cancer behavior. For example, progressive deposition of collagen and increased collagen fiber linearization are associated with breast cancer aggressiveness.While integrin \u03b111-deficiency influenced tumor growth and reduced PIF with concomitantly more disorganized collagen fibrils in the orthotopic tumors, no effect was seen in the MDA-MB-231 ectopic tumors. Interestingly, there was similar amount of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 expression in both the MDA-MB-231 models. In a previous study, we also observed that while integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduced RM11 tumor growth, but did not affect 4\u2009T1 tumor growth, the integrin \u03b111\u03b21 expression was not higher in RM11 than in 4\u2009T1 tumors. Thus, differences in integrin \u03b111\u03b21-expression cannot explain the contrasting effect seen in these in vivo models.The different effects seen between the MDA-MB-231 orthotopic and ectopic tumors show that tumor location significantly influences the effect of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in vivo. The tumor microenvironment displays a significant heterogeneity, and the subcutaneous location probably does not always give rise to a representative tissue-specific stromal infiltration. Supporting the fact that the organ-specific fibroblasts influence breast tumor growth differently, co-injection of breast fibroblast with breast tumor cells increased tumor growth, whereas no enhancement was seen with the co-injection of skin fibroblasts. The significance of the local microenvironment illustrates the complexity of in vivo studies, and may explain some of the discrepancies seen with different mouse models. This underlines the importance of choosing the appropriate preclinical model, particularly when investigating the tumor microenvironment. If possible, orthotopic models should be preferred rather than ectopic ones.ConclusionOur findings indicate an important role for integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in interstitial fluid pressure regulation in the breast tumor microenvironment. Further, since integrin \u03b111\u03b21 seems to impede breast cancer growth, it may be an interesting candidate for stromal targeted therapy.Additional fileAbbreviations3H-5FU3H-5-Fluorouracil5FU5-FluorouracilAUCArea under the curveCAFSCancer associated fibroblastsDAB3,3\u2032-DiaminobenzidineECMExtracellular matrixHEHematoxylin and eosinHER-2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IGF-2Insulin-like growth factor 2MABMonoclonal antibodyMBqMegabecquerelMEFsMouse embryonic fibroblastsPABPolyclonal antibodyPBSPhosphate buffered salinePDGFR\u03b2Platelet-derived growth factor receptor betaPIFInterstitial fluid pressureS.C.SubcutaneousSCIDSevere combined immunodeficiencySEMScanning electron microscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerWTWild type\u03b111-KOIntegrin \u03b111-deficient\u03b1SMAAlpha-smooth muscle actinAuthors\u2019 contributionsConceived and designed the experiments: HYHS LS RKR.

Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression. Stroma is composed of vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, and various types of infiltrating immune cells that might interact with each other and tumor cells. In most solid tumors, including breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are predominant cellular elements of the stroma. CAFs constitute a heterogeneous population. Multiple CAF subtypes with separate molecular profiles and different impact on tumor outgrowth have been identified in various types of cancer.Differential expression of markers such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), vimentin (VIM), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) is characteristic for CAFs. Nevertheless, these markers are far from being comprehensive or exclusively expressed by these subtypes of cells. Therefore, spindle-shape cell morphology is still a commonly used way to identify CAFs within the tumor stroma. CAFs were shown to promote cancer metastasis, as well as affect angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance via synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and production of growth factors. Thus, CAF-targeting treatment aimed at modifying their number, subtype, or features is a plausible strategy of improving patients\u2019 outcome in the future.Several studies have shown the significance of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in development and progression of different solid tumors. It was demonstrated that stromal expression of \u03b1-SMA correlate with a high number of lymph node metastases and worse clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs also enhanced angiogenesis and influenced tumor growth in\u00a0vivo, and correlated with higher frequency of cancer stem cells. Of note, depletion of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in pancreatic cancer suppressed immune surveillance by increasing CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in pancreatic cancer.Here, we aimed to better understand the role of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in BC, with special interest in their impact on tumor growth and dissemination among molecular subtypes. We studied in detail CAF heterogeneity in luminal breast cancer (lumBC) at both the molecular and functional level. Using primary CAFs derived from tumor tissue of patients with lumBC, we demonstrated how heterogeneous expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs might determine tumor growth.MethodsPatientsPrimary tumors of 108 patients with breast cancer (inclusion criteria: nonlobular histology, stage I\u2013III) treated in the University Clinical Centre in Gda\u0144sk, Poland (2011\u20132013), were investigated and described previously. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017), and informed consent was collected from all participants.ImmunohistochemistryPreparation of tissue microarrays (TMA) containing primary breast cancer tissues and staining for ER, PgR, HER2, and Ki67 were performed as previously described. \u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and EpCAM (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone Ber-EP4, Dako Agilent) were stained and detected with EnVision FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL and OPN staining were performed manually using SNAIL mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 2G11, Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA, dilution 1:100) and OPN rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, dilution 1:1600) for 60\u00a0min at room temperature.For \u03b1-SMA, EpCAM, and SNAIL, staining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) and percentage (0\u2013100%) of the stained stromal (\u03b1-SMA) or tumor cells (EpCAM, SNAIL) in the total number of stromal or tumor cells, respectively, were determined; index score was calculated as the percentage of positive cells multiplied by intensity, resulting in a score 0\u2013300. For OPN, only the intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) of staining in stroma cells was determined. The overall score corresponding to one patient was established. \u03b1-SMA high status was conferred to samples with index score higher than the upper quartile (Q3) of the whole group.Clinical data analysisKaplan\u2013Meier survival curves presenting overall survival (OS) in patients with low versus high \u03b1-SMA were compared using log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The chi-squared test or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to examine the distribution of \u03b1-SMA protein status among clinicopathological features (stage, grade, lymph node status). Differences in protein levels between groups were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney U test. p-Values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. All the analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 27 licensed for the University of Gda\u0144sk.Isolation of CAFs from breast cancerCAFs were isolated from tumor samples of four patients with lumBC (CAF2, CAF3, and CAF4 were isolated from patients with luminal B breast cancer, whereas CAF1 from luminal A) obtained from the Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk (2017\u20132018) after patients\u2019 written informed consent. Each sample (1\u20133\u00a0cm) was collected by an experienced surgeon in aseptic conditions and transferred into DMEM (HyClone, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, GE Healthcare) and antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). Tissue sections were stored in 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C and transferred to the Laboratory of Translational Oncology where further processing started no later than 4\u00a0h after resection. Tissue sections were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS, minced, and digested enzymatically in 0.35\u00a0mg/ml collagenase (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.35\u00a0mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich) solution in 1\u00d7 PBS for 1\u00a0h with rotation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Disintegrated tissues were centrifuged at 400g for 5\u00a0min, and the pellet was transferred to a cell culture dish. CAFs were separated using serial trypsinization method. After two to three passages, CAFs were controlled for spindle-shape morphology and presence of CAFs markers VIM and \u03b1-SMA, and absence of tumor marker E-cadherin (E-cad).Cell culturePrimary CAFs were cultured in DMEM (HyClone, GE Healthcare) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, GE Healthcare) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO2. MCF7 (HTB-22), T47D (CRL-2865), and BJ (CRL-2522) cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. For all cell lines, the same batch of FBS was used. Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cultures of isolated CAFs and fibroblast cell line, BJ. When cells reached 80% confluency, the medium was changed, and conditioned medium was collected after 72\u00a0h.CAF characterizationImmunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on sterilized cover glass and after 24\u00a0h were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol\u2013acetone mix for 15\u00a0min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent) and incubated with cells for 30\u00a0min. Anti-\u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, dilution 1:1), anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1:1000), and anti-E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal, clone 36, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA, dilution 1:2000) antibody was used for CAF characterization. As secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 594 and anti-mouse IgG DyLight 488 were used (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; dilution 1:2000). Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).Western blotCell lysate was prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich), then protein concentration was measured with a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were separated using 12% polyacrylamide TGX gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad). Anti-\u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, dilution 1:1), anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1:2000), and anti-E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal, clone 36, BD, dilution 1:500) antibodies were used for detection. Appropriate, secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies were used (Sigma Aldrich, dilution 1:100,000).ELISAOsteopontin concentration (ng/ml) in CAFs and BJ-CM was evaluated using human osteopontin (OPN) Quantikine ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Concentration was quantified by measuring the absorption at 450\u00a0nm with a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, USA).3D culture in MatrigelLumBC cell lines MCF7 and T47D were used to analyze influence of CAFs and BJ-CM on colony growth in 3D culture (Corning Matrigel). A total of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 tumor cells resuspended in DMEM were mixed with Matrigel 1:1 and placed into 12-well tissue culture plates. Three-dimensional cultures were then covered with CM from CAFs, BJ, and DMEM as a control, exchanged every third day. For experiments aiming at OPN neutralization, OPN-neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems) diluted 3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml was used. Tumor-cell colony growth was quantified by measuring the area of at least 40 colonies using Olympus IX83 microscope (10\u00d7 magnification) and ImageJ software. Data were presented as mean relative to DMEM\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. Comparative data were analyzed with the unpaired Student\u2019s t-test using the IBM SPSS statistics software. p-Values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant.Multigene expression analysisRNA extractionRNA was isolated from CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA concentration and purity were determined using NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA extraction from lumBC samples (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens) was performed as described.nCounter gene expression assayThe CAFs and clinical samples-derived RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300\u00a0ng) was subjected to expression profiling with nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. Analysis of RNA extracted from clinical samples was processed as described. NanoString data processingThe CAFs and clinical samples RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. Data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls included in the assay and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes, 18 (SD range 2.9\u201366.9 counts) and 4 (SD range 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) in the CAFs and clinical samples datasets, respectively. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples\u2009<\u20094 for CAFs dataset and\u2009<\u20096 for FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 320 and 584 transcripts in CAFs and FFPE dataset, respectively. Genes differentiating between \u03b1-SMAhigh and \u03b1-SMAlow samples were selected on the basis of log2 fold change (log2FC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in compared groups. Genes with log2FC\u2009>\u20091 were considered upregulated; genes with log2FC\u2009<\u2009\u22121 were considered downregulated in the \u03b1-SMAhigh group.Results\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs are associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells in patients with lumBC\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs correlate with poor prognosis and more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells in lumBC.

Mann\u2013Whitney U test was applied\u03b1-SMA was evaluated immunohistochemically in fibroblast-like stromal cells of 108 nonmetastatic primary breast tumors (Fig.\u00a01A). Staining was informative for 106 tumors, all of which showed expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs; importantly, there were considerable differences in the percentage of positive cells (5\u201390% cells of fibroblast-like morphology) and staining intensity (moderate in 31.7%, high in 68.3% of samples; no weak staining was observed).For further analysis, patients were divided into two groups, \u03b1-SMAlow (n\u2009=\u200993) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (n\u2009=\u200913), according to the upper quartile of the \u03b1-SMA staining index (equal 240). The distribution of \u03b1-SMA status in CAFs (low versus high) was compared with clinicopathological data, including dissemination status, and molecular data. There was no correlation between \u03b1-SMA level and stage, grade, lymph node status, or circulating tumor cell (CTC) presence and phenotype (Additional file 1: Table S1) in the whole analyzed cohort.Interestingly, only in the lumBC group, patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs had significantly poorer overall survival rate (p\u2009=\u20090.019, log-rank; Fig.\u00a01B). However, no further correlations with clinicopathological data or dissemination status were found in this subgroup (Additional file 1: Table S2). In terms of molecular markers evaluated immunohistochemically, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlated positively with SNAIL (p\u2009=\u20090.034) and EpCAM (p\u2009=\u20090.016) protein levels (Fig.\u00a01C), pointing to more aggressive phenotype, while no correlation was observed for other previously characterized proteins, i.e., SLUG, CXCR4, and TWIST (data not shown).\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs increase outgrowth of breast cancer cell linesCharacterization of CAFs isolated from patients with BC.

Unpaired Student\u2019s t-test test was applied, ***p\u2009<\u20090.0001 calculated versus control (DMEM)To confirm adverse effect of \u03b1-SMA CAFs on lumBC, CAFs (n\u2009=\u20094) were isolated from primary lumBC tissue specimens and tested on their impact on breast cancer cell lines in\u00a0vitro. After three passages, isolated CAFs were analyzed for the presence of CAF- and tumor-related markers by immunofluorescent staining and western blot along with BJ normal fibroblasts and MCF7 cell line serving as controls. All obtained CAF cell lines stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-cad and presented spindle-shape morphology typical for fibroblasts (Additional file 2: Fig. S1A, B). On the basis of the \u03b1-SMA immunofluorescence staining, CAF cell lines were classified as \u03b1-SMAhigh (CAF3 and CAF4), with the majority of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells (i.e.,\u2009>\u200990%), or \u03b1-SMAlow (CAF1 and CAF2), with the majority of \u03b1-SMA-negative cells (i.e.,\u2009>\u200980%) (Fig.\u00a02A).CM collected from the established CAFs was applied to lumBC cell lines MCF7 and T47D in 3D Matrigel assay. CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs significantly increased MCF7 cells colonies growth in Matrigel (colony area fold change compared with control equaled 2.16 for \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs versus 4.16 for \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs, p\u2009=\u20090.0001) (Fig.\u00a02B, C). Similar observations were obtained for another lumBC cell line, T47D (Additional file 3: Fig. S2).As these results suggested that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs CM promote cancer cell proliferation, we analyzed phosphorylation of two nodal proteins governing pathways activating cell proliferation, AKT and ERK. However, no significant differences were observed in the expression and phosphorylation of those proteins when MCF7 cells were cultured in 2D and treated with CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh or \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs (data not shown).Since in clinical material \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlated with higher expression of SNAIL and EpCAM, we performed qPCR expression analysis of these genes in lumBC cell lines treated with CAFs CM. CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs did not induce expression of SNAIL and EpCAM in lumBC cells (data not shown).Osteopontin is expressed and secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs\u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-secreted osteopontin increases tumor growth.

G Ki67 percentage in patients with different OPN staining intensity\u2014negative to moderate (neg-to-mod) and strong, evaluated immunohistochemically. Mann\u2013Whitney U test was appliedTo identify the potential mechanism accounting for promotion of tumor growth by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs, multigene expression analysis of four isolated CAF cell lines (two \u03b1-SMAhigh versus two \u03b1-SMAlow) was performed using nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString). Differential gene expression analysis identified 29 genes that were upregulated (logFC\u2009>\u20091, i.e., ITGB2, TNFSF4, CXCL6, VCAM1, and OPN) in \u03b1-SMAhigh compared with \u03b1-SMAlow isolated CAFs. They are, e.g., linked with positive regulation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity, as revealed by Gene Ontology analysis. In turn, downregulation was noted for 25 genes (logFC\u2009<\u2009\u22121, i.e., NFATC2, MASP1, KIT, IL17RB, and CXCL14) involved in tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a03A, Additional file 4: Table S3).Then we examined whether the same differences in genes expression were observed in clinical tissue samples from patients with \u03b1-SMAlow versus \u03b1-SMAhigh lumBC. To highlight the most significant differences between those two groups, scores lower than the lower quartile (Q1) of index score were considered as \u03b1-SMAlow, whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh status was claimed for tissues with scores above the upper quartile (Q3). Only one gene, OPN, was significantly upregulated (logFC\u2009>\u20091), and five genes, HLA-DPB1, MS4A1, IL6, CMA1, and REL, were downregulated (logFC\u2009<\u2009\u22121) in patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh (Fig.\u00a03B, Additional file 4: Table S4). Here no interactions were revealed.Interestingly, OPN was the only gene demonstrating upregulation both in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs isolated from lumBC and tumor samples of lumBC with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs. Consequently, we assessed the secretion of OPN by CAFs in\u00a0vitro. ELISA assay indeed revealed significantly higher level of OPN protein in the CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh compared with \u03b1-SMAlow isolated CAFs (FC 4; p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03C).In accordance with this observation, when analyzed immunohistochemically in the lumBC tissue material, OPN protein was present in CAF cytoplasm and their surrounding in 51% of samples, mostly scored as weak\u20141 (41.8%), moderate\u20142 (38.1%), and strong\u20143 (20.1%) staining (Fig.\u00a03D). Strong OPN staining was observed in 20% (21/108) of \u03b1-SMAhigh samples when analyzed in individual tumor fragments. OPN expression was also noted in cancer cells, as cytoplasmic or nuclear staining (in 30% and 19% of lumBC samples, respectively). Although in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis OPN-positive fibroblasts were reported to accumulate in perivascular spaces, such pattern was not observed in the analyzed breast tumors.OPN secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs induces lumBC cell colony growthTo further assess the functional significance of CAFs-delivered OPN in lumBC, we performed 3D Matrigel assay. MCF7 and T47D cells were cultured in Matrigel and incubated with different CAF- or BJ-derived CM supplemented or not with OPN-neutralizing antibodies. We observed that addition of OPN-neutralizing antibody decreased colony growth of MCF7 in Matrigel only in cells treated with CM derived from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (colony area fold change compared with control 4.16 for CAFs CM without OPN-neutralizing antibodies versus 2.87 for CM CAFs with OPN-neutralizing antibodies, p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03E, F). In case of CM from \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs and BJ cell line, the area of colonies remained unchanged (Fig.\u00a03E, F). Similar results were obtained for another lumBC cell line, T47D (Additional file 3: Fig. S2). In accordance with this observation, OPN strong CAF-associated staining correlated positively with the higher number of Ki67-positive tumor cells assessed immunohistochemically in clinical samples (lumBC, p\u2009=\u20090.012, Fig.\u00a03G).DiscussionTME and its components such as CAFs play an important role in breast cancer progression. In this study, CAFs were classified according to the presence of \u03b1-SMA protein, and their impact on lumBC was investigated in the context of this marker both in clinical samples and in\u00a0vitro. We showed for the first time that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs might stimulate growth of lumBC cancer cells by secreting OPN.We demonstrated heterogeneous expression of \u03b1-SMA in intratumoral CAFs in primary breast cancers. We found that high level of this marker in CAFs was associated with poor prognosis in patients with lumBC. Even though there are studies that link \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs with worse clinical outcome in breast cancer or specifically in TNBC subtype, we report this correlation in lumBC for the first time.\u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs could potentially influence patients\u2019 outcome by induction or regulation of more aggressive phenotype of cancer cells (characterized, e.g., by increased proliferation, stemness, or epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, EMT). In line, CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs induced the outgrowth of lumBC cell lines in\u00a0vitro in 3D cultures. However, no induction of phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, proteins involved in cell proliferation, was observed in MCF7 cell line when \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs CM was used. This could mean that another signaling pathway was involved or \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs\u2019 positive effect on cancer cell growth occurs only in 3D cultures that more accurately reflect the conditions of tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. In our cohort of patients with lumBC, significantly higher level of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and SNAIL were found in \u03b1-SMAhigh tumors. In breast cancer, EpCAM is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in the luminal and basal-like molecular subtypes. There are limited studies correlating CAFs with EpCAM, yet Eberlein et\u00a0al. demonstrated that tumor cells (non-small-cell lung cancer) with high expression of EpCAM activate CAF-like phenotype in normal fibroblasts through avb6/TGF\u03b2 signaling. Thus, potential interaction between EpCAM-positive breast cancer cells and \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs should be investigated in the future. In case of SNAIL, this transcriptional factor is essential for EMT and induces tumor cell invasion. It has been reported that SNAIL level is upregulated in tumor cells by CAFs in breast cancer. Interestingly, EpCAM could also contribute to the TGF\u2010\u03b21-induced EMT in lumBC cell line, MCF-7. Thus, in our study, elevated EpCAM and SNAIL in tumor cells of patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may possibly induce EMT, resulting in increased motility of those cells and giving rationale for worse clinical outcome of those patients. Nevertheless, we did not confirm induction of EMT by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs in\u00a0vitro (data not shown). CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs did not induce expression of SNAIL and EpCAM in lumBC cells. Such results may be due to performing experiments in 2D culture or EMT induction by those CAFs not being dependent on secretome but rather dependent on direct contact of interacting cells.To dissect putative factors accounting for \u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-mediated induction of lumBC cell outgrowth and worse prognosis, we analyzed their transcriptome both in clinical samples and in\u00a0vitro. Gene expression revealed that genes upregulated in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (i.e., IL6, IL1B, ITGB2, ICAM1) were linked with positive regulation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity, which was previously described by our team as EMT-promoting mechanism in breast cancers. In turn, genes downregulated in \u03b1-SMAhigh isolated CAFs (e.g., CD40, TNFRSF14, TNFRSF1B, PSMB9) were implicated in tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated signaling pathway. Interestingly, only OPN was upregulated both in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs isolated from lumBC and tumor tissue samples from lumBC with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs.OPN is a secreted, integrin-binding phosphoprotein involved in carcinogenesis. Of note, most studies report on tumor-derived OPN, and little is known about OPN secreted by CAFs. OPN secreted by tumor cells induced expression of CAF-associated markers (\u03b1-SMA and VIM) in mesenchymal stromal cells through upregulation of TGF-\u03b21. It also plays a key role in reprogramming normal mammary fibroblasts to proinflammatory, tumor-promoting CAFs. In breast cancer, elevated expression of OPN was firstly identified in stroma from patients with poor outcome and in CAFs from MMTV-PyMT breast cancer mouse model. We observed positive OPN staining in cancer cell cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly OPN was present in CAF cytoplasm and surroundings. Here we showed that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-derived OPN enhances tumor growth, and this process may be inhibited by OPN-neutralizing antibodies. In our clinical samples, CAF-associated OPN (i.e., OPN found in cytoplasm and/or in surrounding of CAFs) correlated also with the higher percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells, which would stay in accordance with lumBC cell outgrowth depending on \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs-derived OPN-induced tumor outgrowth. One of the previously proposed mechanisms of how stroma-derived OPN impacts cell proliferation and survival was involvement of CD44 and activation of MAPK cascade. Whether the regulation of OPN in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs is through one of the known pathways has yet to be determined.ConclusionsWe showed that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlate with worse prognosis in lumBC and might be associated with more aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells (e.g., EMT-related phenotype and/or increased proliferation). OPN secretion might be one of the mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon. However, the other mechanisms accounting for adverse impact of \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs on lumBC merit further investigation.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblasts\u03b1-SMAAlpha-smooth muscle actinlumBCLuminal breast cancerCMConditioned mediumOPNOsteopontinBCBreast cancerTMETumor microenvironmentFAPFibroblast activation proteinVIMVimentinFSP1Fibroblast-specific protein 1PDGFRPlatelet-derived growth factor receptorECMExtracellular matrixEpCAMEpithelial cell adhesion moleculePublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author contributionsConceptualization, A.M., N.B.-K., and A.J.Z.; methodology, A.M., A.N., M.P., M.N., and N.B.-K.; formal analysis, A.M., N.B.-K., and M.P.; investigation, A.M., A.N., M.P., and J.S.; resources, J.S., J.Z., A.M., and A.J.Z.; data curation, A.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.M. and N.B.-K.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.M., N.B.-K., and M.P.; visualization, A.M. and J.Sz; supervision, N.B.-K. and A.J.Z.; project administration, A.J.Z.; funding acquisition, A.J.Z.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has the characteristics of a complex molecular landscape, aggressive or high proliferation leading to poor prognosis, and behavioral heterogeneity. The purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that the volume of 4T1 tumors correlated positively with the area of tumor fibrosis. Furthermore, we divided 4T1 tumors according to the degree of fibrosis and characterized the molecular characteristics of the four regions. Finally, the difference in the signaling pathways and sensitivity to 138 drugs was analyzed in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression combined with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The myogenesis, TGF-\u03b2, and Notch signaling pathways were upregulated and the patients with TNBC were significantly differentially sensitive to 25 drugs.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that the volume of 4T1 tumors correlated positively with the area of tumor fibrosis. Furthermore, we divided 4T1 tumors according to the degree of fibrosis and characterized the molecular characteristics of the four regions. Finally, the difference in the signaling pathways and sensitivity to 138 drugs was analyzed in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression combined with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The myogenesis, TGF-\u03b2, and Notch signaling pathways were upregulated and the patients with TNBC were significantly differentially sensitive to 25 drugs.

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 3The 4T1-GFP cell line was used to determine whether the 14+ MECs were derived from the expansion of transplanted 4T1 cells. The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

This pathway may present therapeutic opportunities to inhibit CAF-induced cancer progression.BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide among women, and nearly 2.3 million females are newly diagnosed annually. Although there are initial responses to treatment, many cancers relapse and distant metastases occur in nearly one-third of woman; these are typically fatal. The biology behind BC metastases still remains undetermined. Therefore, understanding molecular determinants of metastasis is crucial for finding new therapeutic strategies. The tumour microenvironment consists of immune cells, blood vessels, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and extracellular matrix. This microenvironment plays key roles in disease outcome by inducing tumour cell proliferation and aggressiveness. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), an activated form of tissue-resident fibroblasts present within breast cancers, comprise a major component of the tumour microenvironment, characterised most commonly by expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. CAFs can induce cancer progression and metastasis by secreting various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (e.g., VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12, IL6 and IL8) and by modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) that facilitates tumour cell migration and invasion. CAFs also modulate immune cell function to create an immune-suppressive environment during cancer progression. The process of transformation of CAFs from resident normal fibroblasts is achieved by several growth factors, however, the mechanisms of transformation have not yet been fully explored and may represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention; interestingly, once transformed into CAFs, the CAF phenotype has been regarded as stable, probably though maintenance of epigenetic changes.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3\u2032untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) of target genes, leading to post-transcriptional downregulation. MiRNAs can be oncogenic or act as tumour suppressors, depending upon the specific genes that they regulate. Dysregulation of miRNAs within the fibroblast component of breast cancer has been reported, and is therefore implicated in induction or maintenance of the CAF phenotype. For example, differential expression between breast CAFs and normal fibroblasts has been reported for many miRNAs, including miR-221, miR-31, miR-205, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-107, miR-30b, the let-7 family and miR-26b, although there is relatively little consistency between reports. Far fewer miRNAs have been shown experimentally to have functional impacts on the breast CAF phenotype, or most interestingly indirectly on cancer cell behaviour; examples include miR-26b, let-7b, miR-200 family and miR-29b. Although some of these studies have indicated functional roles for specific miRNAs within CAFs, very few studies have directly investigated miRNA roles on the transformation and maintenance of CAF phenotypes and on how this impacts on cancer behaviour, therefore how miRNAs in CAFs are involved in cancer progression remains poorly understood. Here, we have focussed on miR-222 as a candidate regulator of CAF phenotypes and cancer behaviour. MiR-222 has previously been reported as an oncogenic miRNA in various cancers, including BC, functioning within the cancer cells themselves, as opposed to stromal cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that upregulation of miR-222 induced growth of cancer cells by targeting p27/kip1, as well as chemoresistance by targeting PTEN/Akt. Interestingly, in the context of our study on function in fibroblasts, levels of miR-222 positively correlated with fibroblast viability in hypertrophic scar tissues, while miR-222 has been shown to induce replicative senescence in human lung fibroblasts. However, to date, no studies have been published on roles of miR-222 in CAFs. Therefore, the above observations suggest the importance of miR-222 as a post-transcriptional modifier, playing functional roles in BC progression. However, it is unclear whether expression of miR-222 is only tumour cell specific or the other cells also express miR-222 in tumour microenvironment. As miR-222 is an important oncogenic factor in breast cancer, we wanted to unveil whether CAFs also expressed miR-222 to influence disease progression.Materials and methodsReagentsFoetal bovine serum (FBS), DMEM and antibiotic/antimycotic (100X; 10,000\u2009units/mL penicillin, 10,000\u2009\u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 25\u2009\u00b5g/mL amphotericin B) were purchased from ThermoFisher (MA, USA).

KpnI, XbaI, PmeI, NotI and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (MA, USA).Ethical issues and cell cultureEthical approval for collection and use of human tissue was obtained from the Leeds East REC (references 06/Q1206/180, 09/H1306/108), and also from the Ethical Committee, Medical College, Kolkata, references MC/KOL/IEC/NON-SPON/102/09-2015. Fresh samples of surgically removed breast cancer samples were minced, digested with collagenase IV from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd (Mumbai, India) and plated (collagenase I coated) to derive primary breast CAFs (from within tumour masses) and NFs (from\u2009>\u20091\u2009cm outside tumour margins). Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were obtained from the ATCC (VA, USA). The NF and CAF fibroblast lines were derived from breast cancer samples and immortalised using lentiviral transduction of hTERT, as previously described. All cell lines were cultured in the DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics in a humid atmosphere incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C. NFs were transfected with scrambled siRNA negative control (NC), siLBR, miR-222 mimic or mimic control using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher; MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Similarly, CAFs were transfected with scramble negative control, miR-222 inhibitor, pCDNA or pCDNA-LBR. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested for western blotting, qRT-PCR analyses, senescence studies or migration/invasion studies. To collect NF and CAF conditioned medium, cells were seeded into six-well plates at 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/well. As previously described, cells were transfected as appropriate for 24\u2009h, then medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. After 48 and 72\u2009h of incubation, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 150\u2009g for 5\u2009min, and then the supernatant was collected.RNA isolation and qPCRMiR-222 is upregulated in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and controls breast fibroblast phenotype. a MiR-222 expression was determined by qPCR, and is shown for CAFs relative to NFs in three separate cell types. Left plot: matched pairs of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs were isolated from breast cancer patient samples using laser microdissection of archival (fixed) tissue. The data represent technical triplicates. Middle plot: four matched pairs of primary cultured CAFs and NFs from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. The data represent technical triplicates. Right plot: immortalised breast CAF and NF cell lines. The data represent biological triplicates. b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and miR-222 expression was assessed using qPCR. Data represent biological triplicates. c Relative gene expression levels of the CAF markers, \u03b1-SMA, Fibroblast Specific Protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were assessed in immortalised CAFs as compared with immortalised NFs using qPCR. The data represent biological triplicates. d Relative expression levels of the same CAF markers were assessed using qPCR in NFs (left) or CAFs (right) transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC). The data represent biological triplicates. e NFs or CAFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and protein expression of the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA (ACTA2) and vimentin were assessed using Western blots, along with \u03b2-actin as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005For LMD samples, the total RNA was extracted from using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols, or the mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). RNA was reverse-transcribed for miR-222 using the TaqMan MicroRNA RT kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and the resulting first strand was amplified using specific Taqman miRNA assay primers (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). The PCRs were performed by StepOne plus detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and amplification data were normalised using RNU6 expression. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. For cultured primary fibroblasts (in Fig.\u00a01b), RNA was isolated from a 90-mm dish of cultured cells using TRIzol (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instruction and RNA quantified by MULTISCANGO (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). For miRNA expression status and gene expression status, first strand cDNA and cDNA were synthesised with miScript RT-II kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Superscript III (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), respectively. MiR-222 expression was analysed using PCR starter kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); U6 was used as an endogenous control. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) on StepOne detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Expression was normalised to the house-keeping gene 18S.Protein extraction and western blotsCells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer System (lysis buffer pH 7.4, 200\u2009mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail,\u00a0100\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate) (Santa Cruz-sc24948). The lysates were centrifuged at 12700\u2009g for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u02daC. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) then transferred to the PVDF membranes (Millipore) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk. The membrane was then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Protein bands were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India). Bands were visualised using ECL.Histology, laser capture microdissection (LMD) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)LMD was carried out on the Zeiss PALM Laser Capture Microdissection Microscope exactly as described previously. In brief, archival FFPE cancer blocks and matched normal blocks were obtained and sectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm onto Membrane Slides NF 1.0 PEN (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). A guide section was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a histopathologist (LMW) to identify areas of fibroblasts with very few admixed inflammatory cells, epithelial cells or necrosis. The equivalent areas were then identified on other sections, and these were collected with the laser into lids of AdhesiveCap500 opaque PCR Tubes (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) by laser pressure catapulting (LPC). The microscope settings used for LCM were cut energy 71, focus 65, LPC energy 100, focus 65 at \u00d7100 magnification. Areas dissected from each case varied between 5.2 and 27.4\u00d7106\u2009\u03bcm2 depending on fibroblast density. For IHC, FFPE human breast cancer resection tissue was available; cancerous and non-cancerous breast tissue were immunostained for \u03b1-SMA and LBR. The signal was amplified and visualised with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen, followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin.Luciferase reporter assaysLamin B Receptor (LBR) is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts and is downregulated in breast CAFs relative to matched NFs. a LBR was identified as a potential miR-222 target by bioinformatics. The potential miR-222-binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is shown (WT), along with a binding-dead mutant used experimentally (MUT). b Luciferase reporters were cloned that allow expression of luciferase transcripts containing the wild-type or mutant LBR miR-222 3\u2032UTR binding sites. These were transfected into NFs (left) or CAFs (right) along with either miR-222 mimic or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC), and relative luciferase activity was determined. The data represent two biological replicates. c, d NFs or CAFs were transfected as shown, and the relative expression of endogenous LBR was determined using qPCR (c) or western blots (d). qPCR data represent three biological replicates. e Representative matched pair of normal and breast cancer tissues was assessed for expression of LBR by immunohistochemistry (\u00d710 and \u00d720 magnification). Brown staining represents expression of the target protein, while pink is a counterstain. f Relative expression of LBR was assessed in eight pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour. The data represent technical triplicates. g Protein expression levels of LBR, and the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA and vimentin were assessed by western blotting in three pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05The potential miR-222 binding sequence from the LBR gene (WT LBR) and three nucleotide-mutated LBR (MUT LBR) (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned into pMiRGLO (Promega, WI, USA) under restriction sites PmeI and XbaI (primers listed in Table\u00a0S1). Luciferase activities were measured 48\u2009h after transfection using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assays (Promega, WI, USA).Cell proliferation assaysNFs and CAFs were seeded in 96-well plates at 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well and transfected the following day. Cell proliferation was monitored after 72\u2009h by MTT (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). In total, 10\u2009\u00b5l of MTT solution (10\u2009mg/ml) in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMEM media was added per well. After 4\u2009h of incubation, formazan complexes were dissolved in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMSO, and signals were measured using MULTISCANGO plate reader (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). To evaluate the effects of conditioned media, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were seeded in 96-well plates at 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, condition media was applied. MTT assays were performed at 48\u2009h as above.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion ability were determined by Corning transwell insert chambers (8-\u00b5m pores; Corning, MA, USA) and Matrigel (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) coated in a transwell chamber for invasion analysis. Conditional media from different treatment conditions were used in lower chambers for migration and invasion study. The cells were prior treated with conditional media for 48\u2009h. In total, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 were added into chambers and incubated for 28\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells that had migrated or invaded were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, imaged and counted manually.Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) assaysSA-\u03b2-gal activity was detected by \u03b2-gal staining kit (Cell Signaling Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells containing blue stain were counted manually as positive senescent cells, and images were taken under phase contrast.Cell immunostaining and confocal microscopyNFs and CAFs were allowed to attach to glass coverslips overnight at 37\u2009\u02daC. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (20\u2009min) and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 (15\u2009min). Blocking was performed with 5% BSA for 1\u2009h followed by incubation with \u03b1-SMA and vimentin primary antibodies (4\u2009\u02daC overnight).

Differences were considered statistically significant at p\u2009<\u20090.05 using Student\u2019s t test.ResultsmiR-222 is upregulated in breast CAFs, and controls CAF phenotypesMany studies have shown that miRNAs are dysregulated in CAFs. To investigate roles of miR-222 dysregulation in CAF biology, we first assessed relative expression of miR-222 in 14 matched pairs of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that have been isolated from breast cancer resection samples using laser microdissection (LMD). We found miR-222 to be upregulated in CAFs relative to matched NFs in 11 out of 14 cases, representing significant upregulation overall by a mean fold of 3.63 (p\u2009<\u20090.04; Fig.\u00a01a, left plot). To expand this finding, we further assessed miR-222 expression in four matched pairs of primary human breast NFs and CAFs cultures extracted from breast cancer resections; we found a greater than twofold induction of miR-222 in CAFs as compared with matched NFs in all cases (Fig.\u00a01a, middle plot). Finally, miR-222 expression in immortalised human breast NFs was compared with immortalised human breast CAFs; this also showed higher expression of miR-222 in CAFs by more than threefold (Fig.\u00a01a, right plot). We concluded that miR-222 is more highly expressed in CAFs than NFs in breast tissue.To explore functional roles of miR-222 in transformation of NFs to CAFs, we conducted a series of experiments on immortalised human breast NFs or immortalised human breast CAFs using miR-222 mimics to upregulate expression in NFs, or miR-222 inhibitors to downregulate expression in CAFs. First, miR-222 expression was assessed using qRT-PCR to confirm appropriate over- or under-expression (Fig.\u00a01b); miR-222 was significantly overexpressed by more than eightfold and was knocked down to one-third of its original level. Next, the relatively \u201cnormal\u201d or CAF-like phenotypes of these cell lines were characterised to establish their baselines for subsequent analyses. Expression of a range of classical CAF markers was assessed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a01c), immunofluorescence or western blotting (Fig.\u00a0S1). Relative expressions of ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin), FSP, CCL2 and VEGF were all substantially higher in CAFs as compared with NFs (a minimum of fivefold higher as assessed by qRT-PCR), as indicative of the CAF phenotype. Upregulation in CAFs of ACTA2/smooth muscle actin and vimentin was also confirmed at the protein level (Fig.\u00a0S1). Next, NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control mimics, and CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or control inhibitors, and miR-222\u2032s influence on transformation of NFs to CAFs, or on maintenance of the CAF phenotype was examined using the same panel of CAF markers as previously. Transfection of miR-222 mimics in NFs resulted in significant upregulation of all the CAF markers (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, left plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). Furthermore, downregulation of miR-222 in CAFs using miR-222 inhibitors significantly downregulated expression of the CAF markers, with the notable and surprising exception of CCL2 (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, right plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). We concluded that miR-222 levels play key roles in controlling the CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.LBR is a direct target of miR-222To investigate potential mechanisms by which miR-222 plays roles in breast fibroblast biology, bioinformatics tools were used to predict potential target genes of miR-222. We analysed the best possible miR-222 seed matches using miRanda, TargetScan and miRDB software. Eleven predicted target genes were chosen for further analysis based on the target scores, containing seed matches for miR-222. On analysis of expression by qRT-PCR in NFs and paired CAFs from patient samples three of these genes, RECK, THOP1 and LBR, demonstrated differential expression in the predicted direction. LBR showed the most substantial and consistent dysregulated result in NFs and CAFs, and therefore LBR was prioritised for subsequent analyses. The potential miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is depicted in Fig.\u00a02a. We performed a number of different assays to assess whether LBR is a true direct target of miR-222 within breast fibroblasts. First, luciferase reporter constructs containing either the wild-type miR-222 binding site from the LBR 3\u2032UTR or a mutated (non-binding) version of the site (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned. Reporters were co-transfected with miR-222 mimics and inhibitors, or appropriate controls, in NFs and CAFs respectively, and luciferase assays were performed. MiR-222 mimics significantly inhibited the activity of the luciferase reporter containing the wild-type LBR site, while the mutated site was insensitive to miR-222 overexpression in NFs (Fig.\u00a02b, left plot), whereas miR-222 inhibitors significantly increased the activity of the wild-type reporter, while the mutated reporter was again insensitive in CAFs (Fig.\u00a02b, right plot). Next, endogenous LBR expression was assessed in NFs after transfection to overexpress miR-222, and in CAFs after transfection with miR-222 inhibitors (Fig.\u00a02c, d). LBR expression was downregulated by miR-222 overexpression and upregulated by miR-222 inhibition at the level of both transcript (Fig.\u00a02c) and protein (Fig.\u00a02d), findings that were in accordance with it being downstream of miR-222 function. We concluded that LBR is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts, via a canonical miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR.Downregulation of LBR induces a CAF-like phenotypeOur next aim was to determine whether LBR downregulation is involved in determining the breast CAF phenotype, since we have already determined that CAFs overexpress miR-222 and that this can downregulate LBR. In one approach, we examined whether breast normal stroma or tumour stroma exhibit differential expression of LBR using immunohistochemistry. LBR expression (Fig.\u00a02e) was relatively reduced in tumour stroma, in contrast to ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin) (Fig.\u00a0S2), which was relatively high in tumour stroma. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed on eight matched pairs of primary NF and CAF cultures. LBR expression was significantly reduced by a mean of 4.3-fold in CAFs compared with the NFs (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in contrast to expression of the CAF markers ACTA2 and vimentin, which were upregulated in CAFs as expected and indicative of the CAF phenotype (Fig.\u00a02f, g).LBR regulates the NF vs CAF breast fibroblast phenotype. a, b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or control (NC), or plasmid to allow overexpression of LBR (LBR OE) or control plasmid (pCDNA), and LBR expression was assessed using qPCR (a) or western blots (b). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. c\u2013e Immortalised breast NFs (c, e) or CAFs (d, e) were transfected as shown, and the relative expression levels of the CAF marker genes \u03b1-SMA, fibroblast-specific protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were determined by qPCR (c, d), or of \u03b1-SMA and vimentin by western blot (e). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005We next assessed whether LBR downregulation was sufficient for transformation of NFs to CAFs, and conversely whether LBR overexpression would reduce CAF features. We transfected immortalised breast NFs with siRNA targeted against LBR or with an appropriate non-targeting control, and also transfected immortalised breast CAFs with plasmids to allow overexpression of LBR, or with appropriate control plasmids. The efficacy of knockdown and overexpression was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a) and western blots (Fig.\u00a03b); knockdown was to ~30% of the original levels, while overexpression was by more than ninefold. Next, we assessed expression of our panel of CAF markers in these cells after knockdown or overexpression of LBR using qRT-PCR or western blots as previously. Reduction of LBR expression in NFs, and increased expression of LBR in CAFs, significantly increased and decreased, respectively, the expression of all the CAF markers (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). We concluded that LBR is a key regulator of the breast CAF phenotype, and that knockdown of LBR alone is sufficient to transform NFs into cells that resemble CAFs.MiR-222 and LBR regulate migration, invasion and senescence in breast fibroblastsMiR-222 and its downstream target LBR modulate the behaviour of breast fibroblasts. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). a, b Migration (a) or invasion (b) of fibroblasts was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (a, b, upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (a, b, lower panels). c Expression of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase was also assessed by X-gal staining and is shown as blue green colouration (upper panels). Positive cells were quantified in data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). d Expression of the senescence markers MMP3 and osteopontin (OPN) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype markers IL6 and IL8 were assessed by qPCR in NFs (left plot) and CAFs (right plot). The data represent biological triplicates. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Since it has been previously demonstrated that CAFs are characterised by higher cell motility than their adjacent NFs, we also investigated whether miR-222 overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of LBR would induce increased NF migration or invasion, and conversely whether miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression would reduce CAF migration or invasion. Immortalised breast NFs or CAFs were transfected as previously with miR-222 mimics or inhibitors, respectively, or with siRNA targeted against LBR or overexpression of LBR, respectively. We then performed migration or invasion assays using transwell assays. NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siRNA targeting LBR had significantly higher migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, left plots), whereas inhibition of miR-222 or LBR overexpression in CAFs significantly reduced their migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, right plots). In order to confirm that these apparent effects on migration and invasion did not relate to differences in cell numbers induced by the transfections, we also evaluated proliferation capabilities of fibroblasts after these manipulations of miR-222 or LBR expression. We performed MTT assays after the same transfected conditions as mentioned above; there were no significant differences in proliferation of NFs or CAFs after any of these treatments (Fig.\u00a0S3). We concluded that miR-222 and its target LBR have key influences on aspects of CAF-like fibroblast behaviour, namely migration and invasion.It was previously reported that loss of LBR is associated with induction of cellular senescence, therefore, we also specifically evaluated senescence by determining senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activities in NFs and CAFs after dysregulation of expression of miR-222 or LBR. We found an increased SA-\u03b2-gal activity in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siLBR compared to controls (Fig.\u00a04c, left plot). In addition, inhibition of miR-222 activity or increased LBR expression in CAFs significantly reduced SA-\u03b2-gal activity (Fig.\u00a04c, right plot). We also further examined features of this senescence phenotype by determining whether it was also associated with differential expression of other senescence markers. NFs and CAFs were transfected as before, and qRT-PCR was used to assess expression of MMP3, OPN, IL6 and IL8, which are upregulated in senescent cells particularly those showing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Expression of all four markers was significantly upregulated in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimic or siLBR (Fig.\u00a04d, left plot), while expression was significantly downregulated in CAFs transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or to overexpress LBR (Fig.\u00a04d, right plot). This provided strong support that changes in \u03b2-gal activity we had detected were indeed associated with senescence, and that miR-222 and LBR expression impact on senescence phenotypes in breast fibroblasts.miR-222 and LBR in breast fibroblasts regulate proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cellsMiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to influence cancer cell proliferation and metastatic potential. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. a, b Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled was determined using MTT assay. The data represent biological triplicates. c\u2013f Migration (c, e) or invasion (d, f) of epithelial cancer cells was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05To better understand the exact effects of miR-222 and its action on LBR in fibroblasts on epithelial breast cancer cell behaviour, we assessed abilities of NFs and CAFs after manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression to induce growth or migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. In particular, we focused on the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and the relatively less metastatic and triple-negative MDA-MB-157 cell lines. In order to assess influences of fibroblasts on the cancer cells, we decided to collect conditioned medium from fibroblasts and treat cancer cells with this. Fibroblast-conditioned medium has frequently been shown to influence cancer cell behaviour in this context. NFs or CAFs were transfected exactly as previously. Conditional medium (CM) was collected from these cells after transfection, and was added to cultures of epithelial breast cancer cells. First, proliferation of epithelial cells was assessed using MTT assays after treatment with CM (Fig.\u00a05a, b). In both epithelial cell lines, CM from control NFs caused a marginal, but not significant, reduction in proliferation, while CM from control CAFs caused a marked and significant increase in proliferation when compared with cells without CM (p\u2009<\u20090.005), as has been reported previously. More interestingly, overexpression of miR-222 in NFs and knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs significantly altered the activity of these CMs on both epithelial cell lines; miR-222 overexpression in NFs produced CM that had similar growth inducing effects to that from control CAFs, while knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs reduced this growth stimulation (Fig.\u00a05a). Changes in LBR expression within NFs and CAFs also had similar significant effects, with LBR knockdown allowing CM from NFs to induce relative growth increases, while overexpression of LBR in CAFs reduced the growth stimulatory effect of CAF CM (Fig.\u00a05b). We concluded that upregulation of miR-222 and downregulation of LBR were both necessary and sufficient for CAF function with respect to inducing proliferation of breast cancer cells. Next, we investigated the influences of these CMs on the motility of BC cells. BC cells also responded dramatically and significantly to these CMs in terms of migration and invasion capacities. CM from NFs had little influence on migration, while CM from CAFs significant and consistently induced migration (Fig.\u00a05c, e) and invasion (Fig.\u00a05d, f) in both epithelial cell lines. Overexpression of miR-222 or knockdown of LBR in NFs led to enhanced migration in the epithelial lines. Knockdown of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs led to reduced migration in the epithelial lines. Exactly the same result was evident in terms of invasion, with miR-222 and LBR having a key influence on abilities of NFs or CAFs to induce invasion in both epithelial cell lines (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013f). To further clarify that differences in migration/invasion of the breast cancer epithelial cells treated with CM did not solely relate to changes in proliferation rate, we additionally performed an experiment assessing proliferation in the cells treated exactly as for the migration/invasion assay (Fig.\u00a0S4), which involves an earlier time point than that used for Fig.\u00a05a, b. There were no significant differences in almost all combinations, supporting the conclusion that true differences in migration/invasion were seen. An exception is MDA-MB-157 cells treated with CAF CM, in which a significant reduction in proliferation was seen with CM after miR-222 knockdown and LBR overexpression; however, this change in proliferation was only up to 20% (Fig.\u00a0S4), whereas decreases in migration/invasion were up to 50% (Fig.\u00a05e, f), indicating that\u2014again\u2014true influences on migration/invasion were seen.MiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to activate EMT in breast cancer cells. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. Expression levels of the EMT-associated genes slug and vimentin were assessed in MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled using qPCR (a, c) or western blots (b, d). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Finally, to determine whether the fibroblasts were influencing migration and invasion capacity of epithelial cells by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways, we analysed expression of EMT markers slug and vimentin in the BC cells after culture with the same CMs, using both qRT-PCR and western blots (Fig.\u00a06). CM from NFs had little influence on slug or vimentin expression at either transcript or protein level, while CM from CAFs induced up to a sixfold increase in expression. Manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression in the fibroblasts consistently and significantly altered slug and vimentin expression in accordance with the changes in migration and invasion, with greater slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade more by miR-222 mimics or LBR siRNA in NFs, and reduced slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade less by miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression in CAFs. We concluded that miR-222 and, downstream of this, LBR have key influences on abilities of breast fibroblasts to control critical cancer-related behaviours of breast epithelial cancer cells, including proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT.DiscussionIncreasing evidence supports the proposal that miRNA dysregulation within CAFs modulates function of the tumour microenvironment. However, it is worth highlighting that most studies have emphasised investigation of miRNA roles within the tumour cells themselves, therefore it remains the case that relatively little is known about roles of miRNAs in the tumour microenvironment. In this study, we have focussed on roles of miR-222 within fibroblasts.We initially compared the miR-222 expression difference between CAFs and adjacent NFs in breast cancer tissue samples. Our study demonstrated that miR-222 was significantly upregulated in CAFs. Although others have made similar comparisons for multiple miRNAs in this context, miR-222 has not previously been identified as differentially expressed. This may be because studies have not always effectively purified only the fibroblasts for their analyses, as we have by LMD, or may be because miR-222 was not always included in the analyses. Next, we identified that miR-222 targets Lamin B receptor (LBR) expression in the CAFs. Various targets of miR-222 have been published previously, but LBR is a novel target on which we focused since we were able to confirm its downregulation in CAFs in accordance with negative regulation by the upregulated miR-222. Most importantly, downregulation of LBR with siRNA phenocopied miR-222 overexpression in functional experiments using breast fibroblasts, strongly suggesting that LBR is a key functionally important target of miR-222 in these cells.In terms of cellular function, we showed that miR-222 and LBR were both involved in defining and maintaining the breast CAF phenotype in terms of expression patterns, and fibroblast behaviours including migration and invasion. MiR-222 has previously been assigned roles in promotion of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and drug resistance within cancer cells, so our findings are in accordance with this, although they represent the first observations to our knowledge in a cancer stromal cell type. With respect to functions of LBR, a role in senescence has previously been reported in fibroblasts and we also observed a related result with manipulation of LBR expression by siRNA, overexpression or via miR-222 all impacting on senescence in breast fibroblasts. LBR encodes the lamin B receptor, a 70.4-kD protein of the inner nuclear membrane, which is known to interact with heterochromatin and B-type lamins. Other functions for the protein have been implied by observations that ectopic LBR expression deregulates differentiation of olfactory neurons inducing an un- or early-differentiated state.More excitingly, we showed that fibroblasts with differential expression of miR-222 or LBR have potent differential influences on behaviour of two independent breast epithelial cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that conditioned medium from fibroblasts that were stimulated to be more CAF-like by miR-222 overexpression or siLBR promoted breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. Similarly, abilities of conditioned medium from CAFs to promote breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion was inhibited by reduced miR-222 levels or by LBR overexpression. Next, we investigated possible pathways involved in the breast tumour motility effects. We found that the enhanced migration and invasion were associated with increased expression of vimentin and slug in the BC cells, suggesting involvement of the EMT pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-222 upregulation, and subsequent LBR downregulation, within fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment contribute to progression of BC, through induction of proliferation and EMT-related motility. It is established that cancer progression is not only dependent on tumour cells themselves but also dependent on the tumour microenvironment and, in particular, CAFs, which promote growth and invasion of cancer cells through synthesis and remodelling of ECM and secreting some growth factors. Hence, blocking CAF activity may be a key approach to effectively control cancer metastasis. Manipulation of either miR-222 expression or LBR function provide candidate approaches for development of these types of anti-cancer therapies. In particular, our data demonstrate that reduced expression of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs greatly reduces their ability to promote aggressive behaviours in cancer cells, supporting the proposal that CAF phenotypes are not fixed and could be normalised therapeutically.Surprisingly, our data also implicate the miR-222/LBR axis in senescence induction in CAFs. Previous studies have indicated that increased miR-222 or loss of LBR induces senescence, so this is not a surprise in itself; however, it is unexpected that high levels of senescence in CAFs would be associated with cancer cell behaviours that promote progression, since senescence is often regarded as a tumour-suppressor mechanism in cancer cells. However, more recent evidence shows that senescent cells may promote oncogenesis through secretion of secretory factors (SASP) and several reports describe abilities of senescent human fibroblasts to promote growth and tumorigenesis. In support of this, here, we demonstrated that miR-222 overexpression in NFs induces a SASP phenotype, leading to increased secretion of at least the SASP factors IL6 and IL8, and the classical senescence marker MMP3.In conclusion, we present miR-222 and LBR as key molecules involved in transformation and maintenance of breast CAFs, which in turn therefore impacts on the aggressive tumorigenic behaviour of breast cancer cells. These molecules are novel targets for therapeutic intervention.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-019-0566-7.Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.Ethics approval and consent to participateEthical approval for collection and use of human tissue was obtained from the Leeds East Research Ethics Committee, references 06/Q1206/180 and 09/H1306/108, and also from the Ethical Committee, Medical College, Kolkata, references MC/KOL/IEC/NON-SPON/102/09-2015.FundingThe study has been funded by University Grants Commission (UGC), India [F.101-5/2014(IC)] and Royal Society, UK (Ref No. IE160146).

During this process, intercellular communication is critical, especially between tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), to create a tumor-favoring niche that allows tumor growth and colonization. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts that constitute the major components of TME and play crucial roles in tumor development and metastasis . In human breast cancer, increased CAFs has been shown to associate with aggressive disease, recurrence and drug resistance . However, the role and mechanisms of CAF contribution to breast cancer metastasis is still poorly understood. It remains as a significant challenge to elucidate intracellular signaling pathways in CAFs that regulate intercellular communication between CAF and tumor cells critical for different stages of cancer metastasis.Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles generated in multi-vesicular bodies and released from different cells . They range from 50\u2013150 nm in size and contain bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, including microRNAs (miRNA). Previous studies showed that cancer cells secrete exosomes to regulate recipient cell functions in TME to facilitate cancer metastasis and progression . Exosomal miRNAs derived from cancer cells contribute to increased tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by affecting both local TME and distal organs via circulation . A recent study suggested that CAF-derived exosomes can promote stemness properties, EMT phenotype, and anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells . However, in contrast to extensive studies of exosomes and miRNAs from cancer cells, less is known about the functions of CAF-derived exosomes through delivering miRNA contents to recipient cancer cells to promote cancer metastasis.Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates signal transduction by integrins and other cell surface receptors to regulate cell adhesion, migration, survival, proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cells . FAK overexpression in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis. Previous studies have strongly implicated FAK in the development and progression of breast and other cancers . Several groups, including us, have shown that deletion of FAK in mammary epithelial cells suppresses tumor formation and progression in mouse models of breast cancer . We and others have also shown that FAK signaling play important roles in endothelial cells to promote embryonic and cancer angiogenesis and drug resistance . However, in contrast to the wealth of knowledge on FAK in tumor cells, much less is known about its potential role in tumor stroma, other than a role for endothelial FAK in tumor angiogenesis.In this study, we generated and analyzed fibroblast-specific inducible FAK knockout mice in a breast cancer model to investigate the potential role and mechanisms of FAK in CAF to promote breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Our studies showed that FAK ablation in fibroblasts significantly reduced breast cancer metastasis by impairing the abilities of CAF-derived exosomes to promote cancer cell migration and other activities at least in part due to altered exosomal miR-148a and miR-16. These results provide significant insights into the multiple mechanisms of FAK signaling in TME besides their essential role in mammary tumor cells, which may contribute to the future development of novel therapies for breast cancer targeting FAK.Materials and MethodsTumor miceMMTV-PyMT;FAKf/f mice have been described previously , and Col1a2-creERT mice obtained from Jackson Lab. The tumor cohorts were maintained on a FVB/N genetic background after extensive back-crossing (7x or more). Mice were housed and handled according to local, state, and federal regulations, and all experimental procedures were carried out as per the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Cincinnati. Tumors were measured by calipers and volume was calculated as (\u00bd)(length)(width). To induce deletion, mice were treated with 2mg tamoxifen for three times every other day, intra-peritoneally.Cell culture and treatmentMDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and WI-38 cells were obtained from ATCC. These cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. Murine fibroblasts were prepared from primary tumors and lung tissues, as described previously . Isolated fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, insulin (10ng/ml) and EGF (10ng/ml). Wound healing, trans-well invasion and sphere-forming assays were carried out as described previously . For trans-well assays, 10% serum media was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber while tumor cells were seeded in the upper chamber with 0.1% FBS and tumor cells were assayed for 16 hours. For co-culture trans-well assays (Figures 2C-D), tumor conditioned media pre-educated WI-38 cells were seeded in the lower chamber with respective tumor conditioned media before plating tumor cells in the upper chambers 2 hours later. For conditioned media, cells were cultured in 10% serum media and media was collected after 72 hours. For treatment with miRNA inhibitors (synthesized from IDT), cells were treated at the indicated concentrations for 48 hours prior to starting an assay.EDU incorporation assayCells were cultured with 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) treatment (100 nM) for 4 hrs. The formalin-fixed cells were stained with Tris (100 mM), CuSO4 (1 mM), fluorescent-488 azide (100 \u03bcM), ascorbic acid (50 mM) and DAPI (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 10 min. Three independent field of views for stained cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy and counted for statistical analysis.AntibodiesAntibodies used in this study were Integrin \u03b24 (Thermo Fisher, MA180984), Pan-cytokeratin (Cell Signaling, 4545), Cyclin E (Santa Cruz, sc-481), beta-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A5441), FAK (Santa Cruz, sc558), pY397-FAK (Abcam, 39967), SMA (Abcam, 7817), CD63 (System Biosciences, EXOAB-CD63A-1), CD81 (Cell Signaling, 10037), ALIX (Cell Signaling, 2171) and GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 2118).Histology and immunohistochemistryFor histological analysis of tissues, samples were fixed overnight in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, dehydrated in alcohol gradients, xylene and paraffin before being embedded. Then, they were sectioned (5-\u03bcm) and subjected to immuno-histochemistry as previously described .ImmunoblottingCell lysates were prepared with modified radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer as described previously  with the addition of Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific, 78425; 78428). Protein concentrations were quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method, subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously .Exosome isolation and characterizationExosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described previously . Exosome size were determined using Nanosight and purity by CD63 flow cytometry. Scanning electron microscopy was used to validate the size distribution of exosomes.Quantitative PCRTotal RNA was isolated from cells using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, 74004) per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. miRNAs were prepared from isolated exosomes using mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Equal amounts of RNA were then reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen, 18080\u2013044) using random hexamers as primers. cDNA samples were then subjected to qRT-PCR analysis with SYBR Green (BioRad, 1725121) in a BioRad CFXConnect (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) thermo-cycler. For miRNA analysis, snRNA RNU6B was used to normalize expression levels. List of primers used are available upon request.miRNA sequencing analysisMiRNA sequencing was performed at the Genomics, Epigenomics and Sequencing Core in University of Cincinnati. Briefly, NEBNext small RNA sample library preparation kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA) was used to prepare the library for sequencing, with the following modification for precise library size selection. First, RNA 3\u2019 adaptor is specifically modified to target miRNAs and other small RNAs that have a 3\u2019 hydroxyl group resulting from enzymatic cleavage by Dicer or other RNA processing enzymes. After ligation, the excess 3\u2019 adaptor is removed by hybridization to prevent adaptor-dimer formation. Then, the 5\u2019 ends of miRNAs that have a 5\u2019-phosphate are ligated to the 5\u2019 adaptor. Following 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ligation, reverse transcription is performed to convert the ligated small RNAs into cDNA, and then uniquely indexed by PCR to generate the sequencing library. The libraries containing DNAs ranging from 135\u2013146 bp were purified on 2.75% agarose gels (using a custom-designed DNA ladder for 135\u2013146 bp mixed with library DNA) and eluted in 20 \u03bcl. Two \u03bcl of the libraries were then diluted (1:104) and analyzed by NEBNext Library Quant kit (NEB) using QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA). The quantified libraries were clustered onto a flow cell at the concentration of 15 pM using Illumina\u2019s TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3, and sequenced for 51 cycles using TruSeq SBS kit on Illumina HiSeq system. Sequence reads were aligned and analyzed for differential levels of individual miRNAs by The Laboratory for Statistical Genomics and Systems Biology in the University of Cincinnati.Statistical analysisData were plotted as means \u00b1 SEM and statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed t-test.ResultsFAK ablation in fibroblasts inhibits breast cancer metastasis in vivoTo study the potential role of FAK signaling in CAFs to promote breast cancer development and metastasis in vivo, we crossed MMTV-PyMT;FAKf/f mice  with Col1a2-CreER transgenic mice that express tamoxifen (TAM)-activated Cre recombinase in CAFs  to produce MMTV-PyMT;FAKf/f;Cre mice. They (and all strains used in this study) were backcrossed to FVB/N genetic background (syngeneic to the MMTV-PyMT mice used throughout the study) for seven or more times (>99%, or virtually pure FVB/N) to eliminate potential influence of genetic background on phenotypes. Cohorts of female MMTV-PyMT;FAKf/f;Cre mice were treated with vehicle (designated as Ctrl mice) or TAM (designated as cKO mice after induced FAK deletion) at 5 weeks of age every other day for 3 times [2 mg each time] (Fig. 1A). Unlike previous studies deleting FAK in tumor cells , ablation of FAK in CAFs did not affect endogenous mammary tumor development in cKO mice relative to Ctrl mice (Fig. 1B). Further, primary tumor growth was comparable in cKO and Ctrl mice (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, however, we observed that cKO mice developed metastasis at a significantly reduced frequency than Ctrl mice at 4 weeks after TAM treatments (Figs. 1D-1E).To verify FAK deletion in CAFs, tumor cells and CAFs were prepared from mammary tumors in cKO and Ctrl mice, as described previously . Western blot analysis of lysates showed FAK deletion specifically in CAFs, but not mammary tumor cells, from cKO mice (Figs. 1F-1H). We next isolated CAFs from lungs of these mice by FACS using PDGFR\u03b2 as a marker , and showed that FAK was deleted in cKO CAFs compared to CAFs from Ctrl mice (Figs. 1I-1J). Lung epithelial cells from cKO and Ctrl mice showed comparable levels of FAK (data not shown). Western blotting analysis using alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) as a marker for fibroblasts activation (i.e. CAFs) showed comparable levels of a-SMA in fibroblasts from cKO and Ctrl mice, suggesting that FAK deletion did not affect CAF formation in cKO mice. Together, these results suggest that FAK deletion in CAF suppressed breast cancer metastasis, although it did not affect primary mammary tumor development and growth.FAK signaling in CAFs is required for their promotion of tumor cell migration in vitroTo further evaluate a role of FAK signaling in CAFs to promote human breast cancer metastasis, we prepared human CAFs and examined their effects on human breast cancer cell migration in vitro. First, WI-38 human fibroblasts were incubated with conditioned media (CM) from several human breast cancer cells, and examined by western blotting using antibody for a-SMA (Figs. 2A-2B). We found that CM from MCF-7, HCC-1954 and MDA-231 breast cancer cells, but not MCF10A (a normal mammary epithelial cell line), induced WI-38 cells to a CAF-like state with increased expression of a-SMA. FAK phosphorylation was also increased in WI-38 cells treated with CM from these breast cancer cells, supporting a potential role for FAK signaling in CAFs. We next analyzed the ability of the treated WI-38 cells to promote migration of breast cancer cells, which is an important characteristic of metastasis. We found that WI-38 cells treated with HCC-1954 and MDA-231 CM promoted migration of these two breast cancers relative to WI-38 cells not treated (NT) with the CM, while those treated with MCF7 CM increased its migration slightly (Figs. 2C and 2D).To examine directly the role of FAK signaling in CAF, we generated WI-38 cells with stable FAK knockdown using lentiviral vectors for FAK shRNA and examined their ability to promote migration of MDA-231 cells following treatment with MDA-231 CM. We found that FAK knockdown did not change activation of WI-38 cells by MDA-231 CM, as measured by a-SMA expression (Fig. 2E). However, FAK knockdown abolished the ability of MDA-231 CM treated-WI-38 cells to promote migration of breast cancer cells (Fig. 2F). Consistent with these results using WI-38 cells, CAFs from Ctrl mice, but not those from cKO mice, showed greater ability to promote PyMT tumor cell migration, relative to lung fibroblasts from WT mice (Figs. 2G and 2H). Collectively, these results suggest that FAK signaling in CAFs is important for their ability to stimulate tumor cell migration, which were consistent with the decreased metastasis in cKO mice in vivo.FAK deletion in CAFs results in the reduced amount and defective exosomes for promoting tumor cell migration and other functionsExosomes are small micro vesicles containing functional biomolecules like proteins and RNAs, which can transfer between the donor cells and the recipient cells . To explore whether FAK signaling in CAFs regulates tumor cells through exosomes, we isolated and examined exosomes from Ctrl and cKO CAFs by ultracentrifugation of the CM, as described previously . We found comparable number of exosomes in CAFs from Ctrl and cKO mice (Fig. 3A). However, both protein and RNA contents were decreased in exosomes from cKO CAFs relative to those in Ctrl CAFs (Figs. 3B and 3C), suggesting that FAK deletion in CAFs reduced the amount of protein or RNA in exosomes. On the other hand, size distributions of exosomes isolated from CAFs of cKO and Ctrl mice were similar (Fig. 3D). Analyses of the exosome preparations by Western blotting showed that both Ctrl and cKO exosomes are enriched in various exosome proteins; including CD81 and Alix at comparable levels in both exosomes, and CD63 and integrin \u03b24 at reduced levels in exosomes from cKO CAFs relative to exosomes from Ctrl CAFs (Figs. 3E and 3F). FACS analysis using CD63 as a marker verified purities of greater than 99% in both exosomes from Ctrl and cKO CAFs (Fig. 3G). Electron microscopy further confirmed purity of exosome preparations, showing exosomes ranging between 70 to 170 nm (Fig. 3H), which is comparable to estimates by Nanosight (see Fig. 3D).We next examined the effect of CM from Ctrl CAFs with or without exosomes on PyMT tumor cell migration using wound closure assay. We found that while the Ctrl CM significantly increased tumor cell migration, this activity was much lower after removal of exosomes (Figs. 4A and 4B). CM from cKO CAFs also promoted tumor cell migration but to a less extent, and removal of exosomes from the media did not affect this activity (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, CM from cKO CAFs with exosome depletion showed greater activity to promote tumor cell migration than CM from Ctrl CAFs without exosomes (Fig. 4B), suggesting Ctrl exosomes are primarily responsible for the activity in CM from Ctrl CAFs whereas the activity over NT in CM of cKO CAFs are likely due to other factors (e.g. altered chemokine compositions). Indeed, adding back Ctrl CAF exosomes, but not cKO CAF exosomes, to the exosome-depleted CM promoted tumor cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Purified exosomes from Ctrl CAFs, but not those from cKO CAFs, also increased tumor cell colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 4D). Analysis of human CAFs also showed that knockdown of FAK by shRNA reduced the ability of CM from these cells to promote tumor cell migration and proliferation (Fig. S1). Previous studies suggested important roles of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) in metastasis , we therefore also examined the effect of CAF exosomes on BCSCs. We found that exosomes from Ctrl CAF increased tumor sphere formation of PyMT primary tumor cells compared to cKO exosomes or no addition (Fig. 4E). Consistent with these in vitro data, cKO mice showed decreased amount of BCSCs than Ctrl mice, as measured by ALDH assays (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results suggest that FAK signaling in CAFs regulates the generation of exosomes and their functions to promote breast cancer metastasis. Regulation of miR-16 and miR-148a in CAF exosomes by FAK contributes to altered ability of CAFs to affect tumor cell activity and metastasisMiRNAs encapsulated in exosomes are abundant and play important roles in inter-cellular communications . We therefore hypothesized that FAK deletion in CAFs alter miRNAs in exosomes to abolish their activity to promote tumor cell functions and metastasis. To identify the specific miRNAs involved, we performed miRNA-sequencing of CAF-derived exosomes to generate miRNA profiles from Ctrl and cKO mice (n= 3 for each). Comparative analysis of miRNA profiles identified 3 decreased miRNAs and 4 increased miRNAs in cKO CAF-derived exosomes relative to those from Ctrl mice (Fig. 5A). Using additional preparations of CAF-derived exosomes of Ctrl and cKO mice, qRT-PCR further confirmed reduced levels of miR-34b, miR-409 and miR-494 as well as increased amount of miR-16, miR-148a and miR-326 in cKO CAF-derived exosomes (Fig. 5B), suggesting that these exosomal miRs may mediate CAF regulation of mammary tumor metastasis in cKO mice.We next prepared exosomes from human WI-38 cells with or without FAK knockdown (see Fig. 2E) that had been treated MDA-231 CM and examined the levels of these miRs. MiR-16 and miR-148a showed increased expression in WI-38 cells with FAK knockdown, consistent with results in mouse CAFs, although miR-326 was not increased after FAK knockdown (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, we did not find the decreased expression of miR-409 or miR-494 in WI-38 cells after FAK knockdown, and miR-34b was not detected in WI-38 cells with or without FAK knockdown. Similar analysis in WI-38 cells treated with MCF-7 CM showed that FAK knockdown did not change the levels of any of these miRs (Fig. S2), which is consistent with the observation that WI-38 cells treated with MCF-7 CM did not affect migration of these cells (see Fig. 2D). These results further support that exosomal miR-16 and/or miR-148a play a role in mediating CAF regulation of recipient tumor cells. Indeed, both miR-16 and miR-148a have been reported to act as tumor suppressive miRs in different cancers including breast cancer . Thus, it is possible that exosomes from CAFs lacking FAK (either from cKO mice, or human WI-38 cells with FAK knockdown) and enriched with miR-16 and/or miR-148a inhibit various tumor cell activities compared to exosomes from Ctrl CAFs (see Figs. 4C-4F and S1).To further evaluate this notion, we examined expression of a series of putative targets of miR-16 and miR-148a in the recipient MDA-231 cells treated by exosomes from human CAFs with or without FAK knockdown. We found that miR-16 targets CCNE1 and TWIST1 as well as miR-148a targets WNT1 and WNT10B were significantly decreased in tumor cells treated with exosomes from CAFs with FAK knockdown compared to those treated with exosomes from Ctrl CAFs (Figs. 5D and 5E). Moreover, decreased levels of Twist1 and Ccne1 proteins were found in tumor cells treated with exosomes from cKO CAFs vs those from Ctrl CAFs (Fig. S3). We next used inhibitors against miR-16 and miR-148a to further validate their roles in decreasing mammary tumor cell activities. As expected, transfection of miR-148a and miR-16 inhibitors restored the levels of miR-148a targets CCNE1 and Twist1 and miR-16 target Wnt10b, respectively, in tumor cells treated with exosomes from cKO CAFs (Fig. S4). Importantly, transfection of either of these inhibitors reversed inhibition of tumor cell migration and proliferation by exosomes from cKO CAFs (Figs. 5F and 5G). Moreover, transfection of these two inhibitors into cKO CAFs also reduced the levels of corresponding miR-148a and miR-16 in exosomes derived from these cells (Fig. S5A), as expected, and these exosomes induced more tumor cell migration compared to exosomes from cKO CAFs treated with scrambled control (Fig. S5B). These results confirmed efficacy of the inhibitors, and are consistent with the idea that the increased amount of miR-16 and miR-148 in exosome from cKO CAF is responsible for the lower migration of tumor cells compared to those treated with Ctrl CAF exosomes. Lastly, miR-148a and miR-16 inhibitors did not affect the base line proliferation of tumor cells (i.e. those without exosome treatment)(Fig. S6), supporting that they acted on reserving the effect of corresponding miRNAs enriched in exosomes from cKO CAFs which were delivered to tumor cells. Together, these results suggested that miR-16 and miR-148a enriched in exosomes from FAK-null CAFs play a key role in decreasing mammary tumor cell functions and metastasis (Fig. S7). DiscussionCancer is increasingly recognized as a disease involving abnormalities in both tumor cells and other surrounding cells within TME as well as altered communications between the cells . It is well established that malignant cancer cells can activate multiple mechanisms to \u201ceducate\u201d both local and distant fibroblasts into CAFs, which in turn influence various cancer cell behavior to promote cancer metastasis to distant organs. By creating a fibroblast-specific inducible FAK knockout in a mouse model of breast cancer as well as knocking down FAK in human CAFs, we showed a critical role for FAK signaling in CAFs for metastasis. Therefore, unlike some other key signaling molecules that could play opposing roles in cancer vs stromal cells for cancer progression and metastasis , FAK\u2019s function in CAFs as well as its pro-tumorigenesis role in tumor and endothelial cells  highlight significant potential for FAK inhibitors for systemic cancer therapy by attacking both tumor cells and multiple cells in TME crucial for cancer metastasis.Besides well-established roles of FAK in mediating intracellular signaling in tumor and other cells, recent studies suggested new functions for FAK in the regulation of TME through affecting intercellular communications. FAK in tumor cells has been implicated in creating an immune suppressive TME through inflammatory chemokine production and tumor-associated regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruitment . Other studies suggested a role for FAK in regulating the composition of the fibrotic and immune-suppressive niche in pancreatic tumor model . Our results reveal new FAK functions in fibroblasts required for their activation to CAFs in response to tumor cells, and more importantly the ability of CAFs to promote breast tumor cell migration. FAK can regulate diverse signaling pathways through its phosphorylation of and interaction with multiple other molecules. Using FAK mutant knock-in alleles in breast cancer models, we showed previously that FAK kinase activity was required for some, but not other, subtypes of breast cancer , and that FAK interaction with endophilin A2 specifically affect breast cancer stem cell pool but not bulk tumor cells . It will be interesting to determine the role of FAK kinase activity and specific downstream pathways in its regulation of CAF-derived exosomal miRNAs to promote breast cancer metastasis using similar strategies.Exosomes have emerged as an important mediator of inter-cellular communication between various cells. Our findings are consistent with a number of previous studies showing promotion of breast cancer cell migration and metastasis by CAF-derived exosomes .Moreover, these data provide strong support for a role of exosomal miRNAs in mediating the the reduced metastasis upon FAK ablation in CAFs of cKO mice, although we could not exclude potential contribution by changes in exosomal RNAs and/or proteins from cKO CAFs (e.g. decreased amount of integrin \u03b24 and/or CD63, see Figs. 3E and 3F). We found that FAK ablation in CAFs increased levels of exosomal miR-148a, which decreased WNT1 and WNT10B expression in the recipient cancer cells. These data provided further support the previous observation that CAF exosomes stimulate Wnt-PCP signaling to drive breast cancer cell invasive activities . Our studies also showed increased levels of exosomal miR-16 from FAK-null CAFs that decreased other genes CCNE1 and TWIST1 to reduced cancer cell proliferation and EMT. Besides the increased tumor suppressive miR-148a and miR-16, we also found reduced levels of oncogenic miRs-34b, 409 and 494 in CAF-derived exosomes of cKO mice. However, we did not detect similar decreases of these oncogenic miRs in human CAFs following FAK knockdown, which could be due to incomplete ablation of FAK in these cells by knockdown approach. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that inhibition of one or more of the oncogenic miRs will reduce the ability of CAF exosomes to promote metastasis in cKO mice, possibly in conjunction with the increased levels of tumor suppressive miR-16 and/or miR-148a, as discussed above. Indeed, one caveat in support of the roles of increased miR-16 and miR-148a in cKO CAFs is the reduced amount of cKO exosomes compared to that from Ctrl CAFs (thus cancelling out the net effect of the enriched miRs on per exosome basis). However, multiple miRs may act in an integrated manner to influence recipient tumor cell behavior, and in such a case, both the reduced oncogenic miRs and the enriched suppressive miRs from the overall reduced exosome amount in cKO CAFs may be involved.Cancer metastasis is a complex, multiple stage process including tumor cell intravasation into the blood or lymphatic vasculature at the primary tumor site, survival in the blood/lymphatic vessels, and colonization and growth at the metastatic site such as the lung. Interestingly, we found that FAK ablation in CAFs inhibited breast cancer metastasis, but it had no apparent effects on the development and growth of primary tumors. Thus, it is possible that defective CAFs at the lung metastatic sites could be responsible for the reduced colonization and/or growth at the tumor cells to inhibit metastasis observed in cKO mice. Alternatively, our data showing that FAK ablation diminished the ability of CAFs to promote tumor cell migration are also consistent with the possibility that cKO CAFs affected metastasis by reduced support for tumor cell intravasation despite not affecting the primary tumor development or growth. Future studies will be directed towards examining these possibilities to further dissect the mechanism involved. We also noted that FAK-null CAF exosomes with enriched miR-16 and miR-148a inhibited proliferation of tumor cells in vitro, although primary tumor growth was not affected in cKO mice in vivo. It is possible that primary tumors developed compensatory mechanisms so that their growth was less dependent on possible effects of FAK-null CAFs in vivo. Another, not mutually exclusive possibility is that tumor cells metastasized to the lungs have a more stringent requirement for their microenvironment including CAFs to support their growth to form lung nodules (and FAK deletion in CAFs compromising such supportive function), which is reflected in the in vitro assays. Lastly, though less likely, it is also possible that FAK signaling is preferentially more important in lung CAFs (where they were isolated for the in vitro assays) than CAFs associated with primary tumors in mammary gland. Future studies will be necessary to gain additional mechanistic insights using our unique mouse models and reagents derived from them. Likewise, it will also be interesting to evaluate potential differential changes in specific subsets of CAFs upon FAK deletion and their contributions to the reduced metastasis in vivo, given recent studies showing multiple subsets of CAFs that could support or suppress tumor progression . Lastly, defective CAFs upon FAK ablation could modulate other TME components such as immune cells and ECs to impact indirectly on cancer metastasis. The availability of the fibroblast-specific cKO mice described here, along with FAK cKO mice in ECs  and mammary tumor cells  will offer appropriate models to fully understand the complex mechanism of FAK signaling in the regulation of metastasis in vivo.In summary, our studies revealed a new function for FAK in intercellular communication between CAFs in TME and mammary tumor cells important for cancer cell migration and metastasis. FAK ablation in CAFs impaired their ability to promote cancer cell migration and other activities due to alterations in exosomal miRs. These findings provide new insights into the complex role of FAK signaling in TME and cross-talk with mammary tumor cells and further highlight the potential of targeting FAK in the development of systemic and effective therapy for advanced and metastatic breast cancer.Supplementary MaterialReferencesCancer-associated fibroblasts as another polarized cell type of the tumor microenvironmentA potent far-upstream enhancer in the mouse pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene regulates expression of reporter genes in transgenic miceFrequent deletions and down-regulation of micro- RNA genes miR15 and miR16 at 13q14 in chronic lymphocytic leukemiaFibroblast Heterogeneity and Immunosuppressive Environment in Human Breast CancerIdentification of two distinct carcinoma-associated fibroblast subtypes with differential tumor-promoting abilities in oral squamous cell carcinomaCancer stem cells: models and conceptsCancer-associated fibroblasts release exosomal microRNAs that dictate an aggressive phenotype in breast cancerp62/SQSTM1 by Binding to Vitamin D Receptor Inhibits Hepatic Stellate Cell Activity, Fibrosis, and Liver CancerFunction of focal adhesion kinase scaffolding to mediate endophilin A2 phosphorylation promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and mammary cancer stem cell activities in vivoFocal adhesion kinase and p53 signaling in cancer cellsA protocol for exosome isolation and characterization: evaluation of ultracentrifugation, density-gradient separation, and immunoaffinity capture methodsHallmarks of cancer: the next generationExosome-mediated microRNA signaling from breast cancer cells is altered by the anti-angiogenesis agent docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)Tumour exosome integrins determine organotropic metastasisMesenchymal-specific deletion of C/EBPbeta suppresses pulmonary fibrosisTargeting focal adhesion kinase renders pancreatic cancers responsive to checkpoint immunotherapyThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerMammary epithelial-specific disruption of the focal adhesion kinase blocks mammary tumor progressionThe Role of Mir-148a in CancerExosomes mediate stromal mobilization of autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling in breast cancer cell migrationMammary epithelial-specific ablation of the focal adhesion kinase suppresses mammary tumorigenesis by affecting mammary cancer stem/progenitor cellsDistinct FAK activities determine progenitor and mammary stem cell characteristicsThe role of focal-adhesion kinase in cancer - a new therapeutic opportunityStromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFocal adhesion kinase: the first ten yearsMammary epithelial-specific disruption of focal adhesion kinase retards tumor formation and metastasis in a transgenic mouse model of human breast cancerRas- and PI3K-dependent breast tumorigenesis in mice and humans requires focal adhesion kinase signalingDownregulation of the tumor-suppressor miR-16 via progestin-mediated oncogenic signaling contributes to breast cancer developmentThe increasing complexity of the cancer stem cell paradigmThe Biology of Cancer Exosomes: Insights and New PerspectivesBiochemical signals and biological responses elicited by the focal adhesion kinaseMultiple connections link FAK to cell motility and invasionNuclear FAK Controls Chemokine Transcription, Tregs, and Evasion of Anti-tumor ImmunityIL-33 and ST2 mediate FAK-dependent antitumor immune evasion through transcriptional networksCancer-Associated Fibroblasts: Their Characteristics and Their Roles in Tumor GrowthLoss of the Timp gene family is sufficient for the acquisition of the CAF-like cell stateThe signaling and biological implications of FAK overexpression in cancerExosomes--vesicular carriers for intercellular communicationMolecular heterogeneity of breast carcinomas and the cancer stem cell hypothesisCD10(+)GPR77(+) Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessNuclear FAK and its kinase activity regulate VEGFR2 transcription in angiogenesis of adult miceFAK-inhibition opens the door to checkpoint immunotherapyEndothelial FAK is required for tumour angiogenesisEndothelial-cell FAK targeting sensitizes tumours to DNA-damaging therapyCommunication by Extracellular Vesicles: Where We Are and Where We Need to Gop62, Upregulated during Preneoplasia, Induces Hepatocellular Carcinogenesis by Maintaining Survival of Stressed HCC-Initiating CellsCancer stem cells: an old idea--a paradigm shiftSignal transduction by focal adhesion kinase in cancerRole of kinase-independent and -dependent functions of FAK in endothelial cell survival and barrier function during embryonic developmentLigand-dependent genetic recombination in fibroblasts : a potentially powerful technique for investigating gene function in fibrosisFAK ablation in fibroblasts inhibits breast cancer metastasis.

        "content": "It is widely recognized that stromal fibroblasts significantly influence biological properties of multiple tumors including breast cancer. However, these epithelial-mesenchymal interactions seem to be essential in tumor biology and it is not fully clear whether this interaction is tumor type-specific or has a more general non-specific character. To elucidate this question, we tested the effect of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from different types of tumors (breast cancer skin metastasis, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma arising from oral cavity mucous membrane) on the EM-G3 breast cancer cell line. The results were compared with control experiments using normal human dermal fibroblasts, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and 3T3 fibroblasts influenced by the fibroblasts prepared from the basal cell carcinoma. Our results demonstrated that expression of luminal marker keratin 8 was influenced only by CAFs prepared from any tested tumors. In contrast, all tested types of fibroblasts showed a strong stimulatory effect on the expression of basal/myoepithelial marker keratin 14. The CAFs also elevated the number of cells with positivity for both keratins 8 and 14 that are similar to ductal originated precursor cells. The expression of proliferation marker Ki67 was not influenced by any of the tested fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data indicate that CAFs are able to influence the phenotype of a breast cancer cell line and this effect is based on a tumor type-unspecific mechanism. Finally, a clear functional difference between normal and CAFs was demonstrated.",

        "content": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a pleiotropic cytokine with the capability to act as tumour suppressor or tumour promoter depending on the cellular context. TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFBR2) is the ligand-binding receptor for all members of the TGF-\u03b2 family. Data from mouse model experiments demonstrated that loss of Tgfbr2 expression in mammary fibroblasts was linked to tumour initiation and metastasis. Using a randomised tamoxifen trial cohort including in total 564 invasive breast carcinomas, we examined TGFBR2 expression (n=252) and phosphorylation level of downstream target SMAD2 (pSMAD2) (n=319) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and assessed links to clinicopathological markers, prognostic and treatment-predictive values. The study revealed that CAF-specific TGFBR2 expression correlated with improved recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed CAF-TGFBR2 to be an independent prognostic marker (multivariate Cox regression, hazard ratio: 0.534, 95% (CI): 0.360-0.793, P=0.002). CAF-specific pSMAD2 levels, however, did not associate with survival outcome. Experimentally, TGF-\u03b2 signalling in fibroblasts was modulated using a TGF-\u03b2 ligand and inhibitor or through lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated TGFBR2-specific knockdown. To determine the role of fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway on breast cancer cells, we used cell contact-dependent cell growth and clonogenicity assays, which showed that knockdown of TGFBR2 in CAFs resulted in increased cell growth, proliferation and clonogenic survival. Further, in a mouse model transfected CAFs were co-injected with MCF7 and tumour weight and proportion was monitored. We found that mouse xenograft tumours comprising TGFBR2 knockdown fibroblasts were slightly bigger and displayed increased tumour cell capacity. Overall, our data demonstrate that fibroblast-related biomarkers possess clinically relevant information and that fibroblasts confer effects on breast cancer cell growth and survival. Regulation of tumour-stromal cross-talk through fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway may depend on fibroblast phenotype, emphasising the importance to characterise tumour microenvironment subtypes. ",

This might be a common mechanism for acquiring metastatic potential in breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, tumours with the same clinical and pathological status may differ in metastatic potential, and therefore lead to different prognoses. Metastasis of breast cancer cells requires decreased cell\u2013cell adhesion, but increased cell\u2013extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, and enhanced invasiveness and motility via secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes and cytoskeletal reorganisation. A well-recognised mechanism for initiating tumour cell invasive and metastatic behaviour is epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which polarised epithelial breast cancer cells acquire a motile mesenchymal phenotype. However, the common mechanisms of induction of metastasis in breast cancers with different biological characteristics remain undefined. A better understanding of such mechanisms could lead to find universal molecular targets for anti-metastasis therapy.The metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is closely dependent on the tumour microenvironment. The fibroblast is the predominant stromal cell type in tumour microenvironment of heterogeneous breast cancer tissues. Tumour cells activate stromal fibroblast cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through the stimulation of paracrine growth factors, and CAFs are more effective than normal stromal fibroblasts in promoting the cell survival, growth and progression of cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts secrete a number of growth factors, including transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), which is a strong extracellular signal regulating EMT in cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts also secrete chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)/stromal derived factor1 (SDF-1) to induce EMT of cancer cells. In addition, ECM, the non-cellular composition of the tumour microenvironment, is mainly synthesised by CAFs. It functions as a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells through ECM remodelling by ECM-degrading proteases secreted from cancer cells with the EMT phenotype.There is a consensus that CAFs can affect the metastatic behaviour of breast cancer cells. However, it is unclear how CAFs affect the metastatic potential of breast cancers with different biological characteristics. In the present study, we demonstrated that CAFs could enhance the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells with different characteristics through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Different EMT programmes were activated in different breast cancer cells because of the different responses to CAF paracrine extracellular signalling.Materials and MethodsIsolation and culture of stromal fibroblastsTo isolate stromal fibroblasts, primary cancer tissues were obtained from three female breast cancer patients at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH; Tianjin, China). These patients had undergone mastectomy but had not been treated with preoperative chemotherapy. The tissue specimens were divided into three parts for histopathological diagnosis, mRNA and protein extraction and isolation of stromal fibroblasts. The investigation and the use of specimens were approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH and written consent was obtained from participants.The breast cancer tissue specimens used for isolation of stromal fibroblasts were diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma with histological grade II and classified as luminal A subtype with oestrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative. Importantly, the specimens were assessed by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) to confirm that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells in the heterogeneous cancer tissue (Figure 1A and B).The fresh tissues were sliced and digested with 160\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 collagenase A (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and 25\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009h. Then the cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) until cells grew into a confluent monolayer. After 2\u20133 passages, a unique homogeneity of stromal fibroblasts was formed. All the stromal fibroblasts used in the experiments were at less than 10 passages. To prepare conditioned medium of cultured CAFs (CAF-CM) for breast cancer cell treatments, stromal fibroblasts isolated from three tissue specimens were mixed and cultured for 48\u2009h, then collected and centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 5000\u2009r.p.m. to remove cell debris.Culture of breast cancer cell linesBreast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, each with different biological characteristics and metastatic potential, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) or DMEM/F12 (T47D) medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100\u2009units per ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells in logarithmic growth phase or at 80% confluence were used for experiments. Breast cancer cell lines were treated with the CM of stromal fibroblasts, diluted with an equal volume of fresh medium for 2 days. An equal volume of complete culture medium was used as the control.Cell\u2013ECM adhesion assayBreast cancer cells were plated in Matrigel-coated 12-well plates at 1 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The non-adherent cells were counted after being cultured for the appropriate time and the percentage of adherent cells was calculated as (1\u2013non-adherent cells/total inoculated cells) \u00d7 100%.Wound-healing assayBreast cancer cells were plated in six-well plates at 5 \u00d7 105 cells per well to grow into a monolayer. A linear scratch/wound was made on cell monolayers with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs were taken of live cells at \u00d7 100 magnification and the distance migrated was observed within an appropriate time.Cell migration and invasion assayThe invasion and migration abilities of breast cancer cells in vitro were evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). 5 \u00d7 104 cells in 500\u2009\u03bcl serum-free medium were added to the upper chamber, and medium containing 20% FBS was added into the lower chamber. The cells were left to invade the Matrigel for the appropriate time, the non-invading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by wiping, and the invading cells were fixed and stained with a three-step stain set kit (Richard-Allan Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The number of invading or migrating cells was counted under a microscope in five predetermined fields for each membrane at \u00d7 400 magnification.TGF-\u03b2 signalling analysisBreast cancer cells were cultured with CM of stromal fibroblasts containing 50\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 TGF-\u03b21 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to neutralise TGF-\u03b21, or 1.0\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009ml\u22121 SB-431542 (Sigma) to block the TGF-\u03b2 signalling of breast cancer cells.Reverse transcription-quantitative PCRTotal RNA of tissues or cultured cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using a First-strand cDNA Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We quantified the transcripts of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal mRNA quantity control, as previously described. All primers and TaqMan probes for cDNA amplification of various target genes were designed and optimised using Oligo 6.0 software (Molecular Biology Insights, West Cascade, USA), and synthesised by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services (Shanghai, China). Triplicate quantitative PCR reactions were performed for both target genes and the housekeeping gene using Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative expression level of the target gene was calculated by normalising the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the target gene to the Ct values of GAPDH (\u0394Ct), and determined as 2\u2212\u0394Ct.ImmunohistochemistryBreast cancer cells growing on sterile coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue specimens were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemistry staining of specimens was carried out using the primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4; DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark), anti-Vimentin (V9; Invitrogen) and anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7; Invitrogen); the secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used at appropriate concentration. Staining was performed with diaminobenzidine; hematoxylin was used for counterstaining.ImmunoblottingHarvested cells were lysed with protein lysis buffer containing 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5\u2009mM EDTA acid, 1% Triton X-100, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% dithiothreitol and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The proteins in the lysate were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The primary antibodies used were anti-Vimentin, anti-E-cadherin, anti-TGF-\u03b2RII (K105; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA), anti-Smad2 (86F7; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-pSmad2 (Phospho-Ser245/250/255; Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20091000, \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20093000, and the secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20092500. The protein blotting on the membranes was performed as previously described. The immunoreactive protein bands on the membranes were visualised using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare).Immunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on the coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009min. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15\u2009min, washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained using DAPI permamount. The protein expression was visualised using a fluorescence microscope.Cytokine antibody array analysisThe TGF\u03b2s secreted from CAFs were analysed using a Cytokine Antibody Array (R&D Systems) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, membranes were incubated with 1.0\u2009ml of CAF-CM at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted biotin-conjugated antibodies were added to each membrane, which was then incubated at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to each membrane and incubated at room temperature for 2\u2009h. The membranes were placed into the mixed Detection Buffer and exposed to X-ray film. The intensities of signals were quantified by ScanAlyze software (Michael Eisen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA). A positive control was used to normalise the results from the different membranes being compared. All samples were performed in duplicates.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation. Student's t-test and rank sum test were used to compare the differences between the experimental group and control group. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.ResultsThe stromal fibroblasts isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibit characteristics of CAFsTo characterise stromal fibroblasts in the microenvironment of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from primary breast cancer tissues. In the primary breast cancer tissue, we observed that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells (Figure 1A), and some of them were active fibroblasts with positive \u03b1-SMA staining (Figure 1B). The stromal cells separated from primary breast cancer tissues were a heterogeneous mixture of a variety of cells in the primary culture, with fibroblasts being the main component. After passaging the primary culture cells, uniform fibroblasts started to grow (Figure 1C). The stromal fibroblasts showed positive staining for the mesenchymal marker vimentin (Figure 1D) and negative staining for the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Figure 1E). In particular, they expressed the activated myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA (Figure 1F) and CXCL12 (Supplementary Figure 1A). These results indicated that the isolated and cultured fibroblasts in vitro from breast cancer tissues maintained the features of CAFs.To investigate whether the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro are retained features of CAFs, we detected the expression of E-cadherin, \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 in CAFs at different low passages. The results showed that the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 were similar in all the CAFs at different passages, and E-cadherin was not expressed in any CAFs at different passages (Supplementary Figure 1B and C), which indicated that the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro retained the features of CAFs.CAFs enhanced aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cellsTo investigate the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cells with different intrinsic characteristics, the CAF-CM was collected and used to culture breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231. The epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells cultured with CAF-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering. The mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells cultured with CAF-CM were also changed to more fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 2A). All the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM had enhanced cell\u2013ECM adhesion (Figure 2B), migration (Figure 2C\u2013E) and invasion (Figure 2F and G) compared with the control cells. All the above results suggested that CAF-secreted proteins could stimulate these different breast cancer cell lines to change their morphologies and phenotypes to have more metastatic potential.CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cellsTo investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by CAF-CM in breast cancer cell lines, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1), mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM) and fibronectin 1 (FN1), as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with CAF-CM. Results showed that cells cultured with CAF-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in MCF-7 and T47D cells, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3A and C). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker VIM, FN1, MMP2 and MMP9 were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM (Figure 3B and D). These results indicated that factors secreted by CAFs could induce the EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.To investigate whether EMT programming was activated by CAF-secreted factors in these breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics, the expression of EMT-related transcription factors (EMT-TFs) snail homolog 1 (SNAI1), SNAI2, twist basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix transcription factor 1 (TWIST1) and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was measured in breast cancer cell lines cultured with CAF-CM. The results showed that SNAI1 expression levels were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM, SNAI2 expression levels were upregulated in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells but not in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells, TWIST1 expression levels were upregulated in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells but not in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells, and ZEB1 expression levels were upregulated only in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3E). These results indicated that CAF-secreted proteins induced the EMT phenotype through common and/or unique activation of EMT-TFs in breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics.CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling in breast cancer cells via CAF-secreted TGF-\u03b21As TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer, we examined whether CAFs secreted any TGF isoform into CAF-CM. Our results showed that CAFs secreted significantly more TGF-\u03b21 than TGF-\u03b22 or TGF-\u03b23 (Figure 4A). We then compared the mRNA expression of the TGF-\u03b21-coding gene TGFB1 in CAFs and breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that TGFB1 expression levels were significantly higher in CAFs than those in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 was mainly secreted by the CAFs in the co-culture of CAFs with breast cancer cells.To investigate the effect of CAF-CM on activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling in breast cancer cell lines, we compared the expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 receptor type II (TGF-\u03b2RII), total Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad2 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CM or control medium. The results showed that CAF-CM significantly increased phosphorylated Smad2 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, whereas total Smad2 was not affected. Although TGF-\u03b2RII expression levels were different in the three cell lines, they were not affected by culturing with CAF-CM (Figure 4C). Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 secretion by breast cancer cells was not affected neither (Figure 4D). These results indicate that CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling pathway in breast cancer cells mainly through paracrine TGF-\u03b21.EMT programming and phenotype were reversed by blocking TGF-\u03b21 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CMTo further test the role of TGF-\u03b21 signalling in EMT phenotype changes of breast cancer cells, TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody and TGF-\u03b2 signalling blocking reagent SB-431542 were added to CAF-CM for culturing epithelial cells MCF-7 and mesenchymal-like cells MDA-MB-231. Then, the expression of epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers and EMT-TFs were examined. After culturing in CAF-CM, the E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells was reduced, and vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was increased. Moreover, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5A). Similarly, the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was also reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5B). Consistent with the effects of TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody, adding SB-431542 in CAF-CM also reversed the reduced E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM (Figure 5C), as well as the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the enhanced abilities of migration and invasion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding anti-TGF-\u03b21 antibody (Figure 5E and F). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 secreted from CAFs was an important regulator for activation of EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.DiscussionIsolation of stromal fibroblasts from invasive cancer tissues followed by low-passaged cultures in vitro is the main approach to investigate the biological characteristics of CAFs and their effects on tumour cells. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin is commonly used as a marker of myofibroblast formation to identify CAFs, and its expression is higher in fibroblasts derived from cancer tissues than in those derived from normal tissues. Evidence has shown that stromal fibroblasts isolated from cancer tissues such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer retain the characteristics of CAFs, with high levels of \u03b1-SMA expression. As luminal A is the most common subtype of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from invasive luminal A subtype breast cancer tissues, and confirmed that the fibroblasts expressed high levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12/SDF-1, which is a typical characteristic of CAFs. Moreover, CAFs at low passages cultured in vitro retained their original features, which was consistent with the Kalluri's report.There have been reports that CAFs could promote aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cells.) demonstrated that downregulation of p16INK4A transformed normal breast fibroblasts into CAFs, which in turn enhanced migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner.) showed that CAFs enhanced migration by promoting EMT of PMC42-LA cells.) found that CAFs promoted EMT of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells, including luminal cells (MCF-7), basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) and cells with both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial characteristics (PMC42-LA). In this study, we demonstrated that factors secreted by CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviours of cell\u2013ECM adhesion, migration and invasion in both luminal (MCF-7 and T47D) and basal-like (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells by inducing or promoting EMT. This suggests that CAF-induced EMT might be the common mechanism underlying the acquisition of metastatic potential in different breast cancer subtypes.EMT enables cancer cells to acquire the ability to complete various steps in the metastatic cascade, and this change in phenotype of epithelial cancer cells is induced by paracrine signals from their microenvironment. It is known that CAFs can induce or promote EMT in a variety of cancers, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not clear. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer. Tumour cells can induce and maintain the EMT phenotype through autocrine secretion of TGF-\u03b2, and can also transform stromal fibroblasts into CAFs by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Although CAFs can also secrete TGF-\u03b2, it is little known whether or how CAF-paracrine TGF-\u03b2 induces EMT in tumour cells. By detection of the CAF-CM collected from CAFs cultured in vitro, we found that TGF-\u03b21 was the major TGF-\u03b2 family member secreted by CAFs. We also found that TGF-\u03b21 was expressed by CAFs significantly more than by cancer cells, and stimulation of CAF-paracrine factors did not significantly increase expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b2RII in the breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, by using a pharmacological inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase to inhibit the receptors of tumour cells, and neutralising antibodies to inhibit secreted TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs, we found that TGF-\u03b21, mainly secreted by CAFs, could induce EMT in different subtypes of breast cancers.Interestingly, we found that CAF-paracrine signalling induced EMT in breast cancer cells with different characteristics are underlying common and/or unique pleiotropically acting EMT-TFs. SNAI1 was activated by CAF-CM in the three breast cancer cell lines: epithelial/luminal A cells MCF-7 and T47D, and mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells MDA-MB-231. SNAI2 and ZEB1 were activated in epithelial/luminal A cells (SNAI2 in both MCF-7 and T47D, ZEB1 only in MCF-7) but not in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231). TWIST1 was activated in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) but not in epithelial cells/luminal A cells (MCF-7 and T47D). This novel observation indicates that different EMT programmes are activated in different subtypes of breast cancer cells specific to their responses to CAF-paracrine signalling. Another interesting finding in our in vitro experiments is that exogenous TGF-\u03b2 alone did not promote EMT of breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, although TGF-\u03b2 is a key modulator secreted by CAFs for promoting EMT of breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics, it needs co-factors to facilitate this process, and the exact mechanism remains to be further explored.In summary, CAFs could stimulate morphological and phenotypic changes in various breast cancer subtype cells to enhance their metastatic potential through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. This might be a common mechanism for metastasis among breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on British Journal of Cancer website (http://www.nature.com/bjc)This work is published under the standard license to publish agreement.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.  Biglycan correlates biological features and clinical outcomesThe correlation between BGN and immune features. a, Heatmap showing the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes. b, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and ESTIMATE stromal and immune scores. c, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and CIBERSORT-derived immune cell scores. Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

        "content": "Tumor-derived matricellular proteins such as osteopontin (OPN) and tenascin-C (TN-C) have been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the molecular basis of how these proteins contribute to tumor progression remains to be elucidated. Importantly, these matricellular proteins are known to interact with \u03b19\u03b21 integrin. Therefore, we hypothesized that tumor-derived \u03b19\u03b21 integrin may contribute to tumor progression. To clarify the roles of \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis, we used an inhibitory anti-human \u03b19\u03b21 integrin antibody (anti-h\u03b19\u03b21 antibody) and a \u03b19\u03b21 integrin-positive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 luc-D3H2LN (D3H2LN), in vitro functional assays, and an in vivo orthotopic xenotransplantation model. In this study, we demonstrated that tumor, but not host \u03b19\u03b21 integrin, contributes to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and host-derived OPN production. We also found that CAFs contributed to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, and host-derived OPN levels. Consistent with those findings, tumor volume was well-correlated with numbers of CAFs and levels of host-derived OPN. Furthermore, it was shown that the inoculation of D3H2LN cells into mammary fat pads with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), obtained from wild type, but not OPN knock-out mice, resulted in enhancement of tumor growth, thus indicating that CAF-derived OPN enhanced tumor growth. These results suggested that tumor \u03b19\u03b21-mediated signaling plays a pivotal role in generating unique primary tumor tissue microenvironments, which favor lymphatic metastasis and tumor growth. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes lymphatic metastasis through enhancing invasion. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes tumor growth through CAFs. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin enhances the recruitment of CAFs into the primary tumor. Tumor cells induce the production of OPN by CAFs in the primary tumor. CAF-derived OPN promotes tumor growth.",

The resulting transformed microenvironment, also-called reactive stroma, differs from the stroma of the healthy mammary gland, showing disruptions in the fibroblast-epithelial cell cross-talk in terms of cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodelling. In particular, the migratory/invasive behaviour of tumor cells seems to be strongly influenced by this aberrant dialogue with the adjacent fibroblasts. The release of soluble factors by both kinds of cell types reciprocally influences their peculiar properties, creating suitable conditions for malignant cells not only to multiply but also to migrate and invade other tissues, outside the boundaries of the mammary gland. Fibroblasts arising from tumor stroma, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs), have acquired distinct properties mainly leading to the promotion of cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Differences in the activity of NFs versus CAFs in breast tumors may result from alterations in molecular and/or cellular mechanisms that are responsible for the production and release by CAFs of a number of soluble factors such as fibroblast growth factors, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), insulin-like growth factors, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Tumorigenicity of CAFs, derived from breast tumors and injected together with malignant cells, has been widely demonstrated in animal models. Induction of mammary cancers has also been demonstrated in mice orthotopically grafted with TGF-\u03b2-and/or HGF-transfected fibroblasts co-injected with apparently normal epithelial breast cells, highlighting the critical role of heterotypic interactions in human breast development. This tumor-stroma cross-talk seems to have an important influence also in the involved lymph-node microenvironments, as demonstrated by the ability of nodal fibroblasts to affect viability, proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. At the root of the alterations in these latter activities seems to be the induction of reciprocal changes in the genomic profiles of cancer and stromal cells involving, in particular, genes critical for growth control, cell adhesion and invasiveness.Despite the growing number of studies focused on epithelial-stromal interactions in solid tumors, the role played by fibroblasts in the development and progression of breast cancer is not yet fully understood. Thus, the use of relevant co-culture models using fibroblasts derived from normal and malignant stroma may provide a practical tool for the analysis of reciprocal influences between the stroma and the epithelial tumor compartment.In the present report, we sought to gain a deeper insight into some molecular and functional properties strongly correlated with cancer progression and metastatization. These properties may be supposed to be reciprocally influenced in the epithelium-stroma cross-talk occurring in breast cancer. With this aim, we performed breast cancer cells/fibroblasts co-culture assays and analyzed changes occurring in adhesion molecule expression, membrane fluidity, and migration velocity and directness in both the cell types. In our experimental approach, we co-cultured estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, poorly invasive and low metastasizing mammary cancer cells (MCF-7) or ER-negative, highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with fibroblasts isolated from mammary healthy skin (NFs) or from breast tumor stroma (CAFs) in conventional 2D adherent cultures or in a 3D system (nodules). Results obtained were compared with those from the respective homotypic cultures.Materials and MethodsBreast cancer cell linesThe estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, poorly invasive, and low metastasizing human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and the ER-negative, highly invasive, and metastatic human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Euroclone, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland), antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, Euroclone) and 2 mM glutamine (Euroclone). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.Clinical specimens and fibroblast culturesBreast cancer tissues and their relative normal counterparts (normal mammary skin samples) were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the Unit\u00e0 Operativa di Chirurgia Senologica, Facolt\u00e0 di Medicina e Chirurgia \u201cA. Gemelli\u201d, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Rome, Italy), according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Donors gave written informed consent to participate in the study.Breast cancer and normal mammary skin tissue samples were minced into small pieces (2\u20133 mm3) and attached onto 100 mm culture dishes. Primary normal mammary skin (NFs) and cancer-associated (CAFs) fibroblasts isolated from clinical specimens were maintained in DMEM (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, Euroclone), 2 mM glutamine (Euroclone) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Euroclone). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.The fibroblastic nature of the isolated cells was verified by microscopic determination of morphology portrait and immunocytochemical characterization using fibroblast- (anti-vimentin, V9 clone, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); epithelial tumor cell- (anti-cytokeratin 18, DC 10 clone, Dako), activated fibroblast- (anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, \u03b1-SMA, 1A4 clone, Dako), and endothelial cell- (anti-CD31, 89C2 clone, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) specific markers. NFs used for co-culture assays were immunoreactive for vimentin but negative for all the other markers. CAFs used for co-culture assays were immunoreactive for vimentin and \u03b1-SMA but negative for cytokeratin 18 and CD31. Co-culture experiments were carried out with fibroblasts (NFs and CAFs) of passage 2\u20133 to accumulate large amounts of cells for co-cultivation while avoiding cell aging effects.3D cultures/co-culturesFor the immnunohistochemical/immunoflurescence analysis, primary fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs) were directly co-cultured with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a 3D model (nodules) as previously described. Briefly, after detachment of cell monolayers with trypsin/EDTA, the cell density was arranged to 2.5\u00d7105 cells/ml for each cell type. One ml of the cell suspension was distributed in 5-ml centrifugation tubes containing semi-solid medium (final concentration: 1\u00d7DMEM-0.5% agar-agar). Cells were spinned down onto the semi-solid medium by centrifugation at 800 g for 10 min at 12\u00b0C. Most of the supernatant liquid medium was removed and the tubes incubated overnight in an incubator at 37\u00b0C. The next day, the pellets were recovered with 200 \u00b5l of 1\u00d7DMEM by gentle aspiration and transferred on 1006-Falcon Petri dishes containing 2 ml of semi-solid medium. Medium was renewed 2 days later and then after 5 days.For co-cultures, a 1\u22361 proportion of each cell type was used. Homotypic cultures of only one cell type were used as controls.After 4 or 6 days of culture, nodules were harvested for immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence analysis.2D cultures/co-culturesFor the evaluation of vimentin expression, cell membrane fluidity and migration, conventional 2D adherent cultures were used. Briefly, confluent fibroblast and breast cancer cell cultures were trypsinized and 0.5\u00d7105 cells of each cell type were plated together in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes (ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) for confocal microscopy analysis in their standard medium, which was renewed after 3 days. After for 6 days, membrane fluidity or cell migration were evaluated as described below. Homotypic cultures of only one cell type (1\u00d7105 cells) were used as controls.ImmunohistochemistryTo verify the distribution of the two cell types in 3D co-cultures, and the effects of the heterotypic interactions on fibroblast activation and cell growth, immunohistochemical analysis of pankeratin, \u03b1-SMA and proliferation markers (Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) was performed on cryostat 10-\u00b5m-thick sections from 4- and 6-day frozen nodules. Nodules were previously fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were collected on superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA), dried for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and blocked with Superblock (UCS Diagnostic, Rome, Italy) for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwave heating (500 W) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer of pH 6.0 for 5 min. The sections were incubated with anti-cytokeratin (large spectrum, pankeratin, KL1 clone; UCS Diagnostic; 1\u2236100 dilution), anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4 clone, Dako; 1\u223660 dilution), anti-Ki67 (MIB-1 clone, Dako; 1\u2236100 dilution) and anti-PCNA (PC10 clone, Dako; 1\u2236150 dilution) 1 h at RT in PBS. Then, a secondary antibody conjugate (HRP polymer conjugate, broad spectrum, Invitrogen) was applied for 30 min at RT. The chromogenic reaction was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution (Zymed Labs., South S. Francisco, CA, USA). The nuclei were lightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed. For proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA), three sections from three different nodules for each culture condition were examined by two independent observers. The number of positive cells (on a total of at least 800 cells) was assessed in four randomized high-power fields (\u00d7400) for each section. All the labelled tumor nuclei, regardless of the staining intensity, were considered positive. A mean percentage for every sample was obtained and data were reported as mean\u00b1SD.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy AnalysisTo assess the effect of tumor cell/fibroblast interaction on cell adhesion, immunofluorescence analysis of E- and N-cadherin was performed on cryostat 10 \u00b5m-thick frozen sections obtained as above described from 6-day nodule homotypic and heterotypic cultures. Sections were collected on superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific), dried for 15 min at RT and blocked with Superblock (UCS Diagnostic) for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwave heating (500 W) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min. Mouse monoclonal primary antibodies anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7 clone, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; 1\u2236200 dilution) and anti-N-cadherin (GC-4 clone, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1\u22361000 dilution) were applied for 1 h at RT in PBS. Sections were then incubated with the secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG, 1\u2236200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at RT in PBS. Slides were mounted using 4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) containing mounting medium (Vector Labs., Burlingame, CA, USA). Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed for all reactions. Images were collected by using an inverted confocal microscope (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). They were obtained using a \u00d740 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) equipped with a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser (Chamaleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) for DAPI excitation at 750 nm and with an Ar/ArKr laser for Cy3 excitation at 543 nm. Internal photon multiplier tubes collected eight bit unsigned images at a 400 Hz scan speed. Image background values (defined as intensities below 7% of the maximum intensity) were set to zero and colored black. Imaging was performed at RT.Fluorescence Intensity values for each sample were quantified over multiple intensity images and ROIs and their mean\u00b1SD (n\u200a=\u200a15 to 20) determined and utilized for further statistical analysis (two-tailed Student's t-test).Western blot analysisCells of 6-day monolayer cultures were collected to be analyzed for verify the co-culturing effect on vimentin expression. Cells in mixed cultures were separated by magnetic cell sorting, using the EasySep\u2122 Magnet (STEMCELL Technologies, Voden Medical Instruments SpA, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS] freshly supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (100 \u00b5M Na3VO4, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 50 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin and 20 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin) on ice and the lysates clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Samples containing 30 \u00b5g of total protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) which was incubated (1 h, at RT) with anti-vimentin antibody (clone V9, Dako, 1\u22361000 dilution) in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk (blocking buffer). The blot was then overlaid with a HRP-labelled secondary antibody (Vector Labs.; 1\u22362000 dilution) for 40 min in blocking buffer at RT. The protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and visualised on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham). Membranes were reprobed with an anti \u03b2-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC15, Sigma-Aldrich; 1\u223610,000 dilution) as an internal control for protein loading. The signals were quantified by densitometry (Chemi Doc Documentation System/Quantity One quantitation software, Bio-Rad).Laurdan two photon microscopyTo investigate the impact of tumour cell/fibroblast interactions on the respective membrane lipid packing density, homotypic or heterotypic cultures, maintained for 6 days in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes, were labelled with 2-dimethylamino(6-lauroyl)naphthalene (Laurdan, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA), a ratiometric fluorescent dye highly sensitive to the presence and mobility of water molecules within the membrane bilayer, yielding information on membrane order and fluidity by a shift in its emission spectrum. The probe was successfully applied to study membrane fluidity changes in living cells. Ratiometric probes allow the use of a ratio between two fluorescence intensities. This makes possible the correction of artifacts due to bleaching, changes in focus and variations in laser intensity. The Laurdan stock solution concentration was 2 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), and it was renewed every three weeks. Laurdan labelling was performed directly in the culture media by adding the probe to the cells in culture at a final concentration of 2 \u00b5M. After 30\u201345 min of incubation in the dark at RT, cells were washed once with the complete culture medium and dishes mounted on an inverted confocal microscope (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems) slide. Laurdan intensity images were obtained using a \u00d740 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) under excitation at 800 nm with a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser (Chamaleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Internal photon multiplier tubes collected eight bit unsigned images at a 400 Hz scan speed. Laurdan intensity images were recorded simultaneously with emission in the range of 400\u2013460 nm and 470\u2013530 nm and imaging was performed at RT.Image analysisMembrane fluidity can be measured in terms of ratio of emission intensities by using Generalized Polarization (GP) value, defined asGP value was calculated for each pixel using the two Laurdan intensity images (I(400\u2013460) and I(470\u2013530)) using the software Ratiometric image processor 2.0. The calibration factor G was obtained from the GP values of solutions of Laurdan in DMSO. G factor had \u223c2% variation across the imaging area. GP images (as eight-bit unsigned images) were pseudocoloured in Image-J. Background values (defined as intensities below 7% of the maximum intensity) were set to zero and coloured black. GP histograms values were determined within multiple Regions of Interest (plasma membranes of single cells) for each sample, and their mean\u00b1SD (n\u200a=\u200a15 to 20) determined and utilized for further statistical analysis (two-tailed Student's t-test). Line profiles and analysis of acquired images were performed with image J.Migration assayTo evaluate the reciprocal influences of tumour cells and fibroblasts on the respective migratory ability, confocal microscopy was performed in a temperature controlled room (T\u200a=\u200a30\u00b0C) on cells (homotypic and heterotypic cultures) cultured for 6 days in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes. In each experiment, the single cell type of interest (tumor cells or fibroblasts) has been labelled with the fluorescent probe CellTracker Green CMFDA (Invitrogen) that is retained in living cells through several generations and is not transferred to adjacent cells. Thus, the single cell movement was analyzed over a time period of 45 min. The time interval between consecutive frames was one min. Background noise was subtracted from each image. Cell tracking was performed by using the ImageJ software plugin \u201cParticleTracker\u201d. On average 40 cells per experiment were tracked. Once the analysis region was defined by means of the feature point detection and tracking algorithm, each cell was numbered and its (x(ti), y(ti)) position coordinates measured for each time point ti (i\u200a=\u200a1,\u2026.,N\u200a=\u200a45). We used the ImageJ-plugin \u201cChemotaxis and migration tool\u201d to analyze kinematic quantities of migration processes: the migration velocity, the Euclidean and accumulated distances and the directness. The instantaneous migration velocity for each cell was calculated as  where vix and viy were calculated according to the expression:Where (x(ti+1), y(ti+1), (x(ti), y(ti))) are the positions of each cell at the time ti+1 and ti. The mean migration velocity  was calculated according to the expression:The Euclidian distance dE for each cell was calculated as the length of the straight line between the cell start point (x(t1), y(t1)) and the end point(x(tN), y(tN)):The accumulated distance dA for each cell is the result of the sum of all incremental movements measured in between consecutive images:The directness, which represents a measure of the cell's tendency to travel in a straight line, is calculated as the ratio of the Euclidian distance and the accumulated distance.A directness of D\u200a=\u200a1 indicates a straight-line migration from the start point to the end point.Statistical analysisAt least three independent experiments were performed for each protocol. The two-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare means of two different groups; ANOVA and the Tukey's multiple comparison test were used to study differences of means of multiple samples. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.ResultsCharacterization of isolated fibroblastsImmunocytochemically characterized populations of the isolated mammary fibroblasts (normal dermal and cancer-associated) stained uniformly for vimentin, but resulted negative for cytokeratin 18 and CD31, confirming the stromal origin of cells and the absence of contaminating epithelial or endothelial elements. As reported in literature, approximately 10\u201312% of the CAFs were positive for \u03b1-SMA, while among the NF population only very few elements showed \u03b1-SMA immunoreactivity, probably induced by the culture condition (i.e. 2D cultures) (data not shown). Morphologically, NFs in culture showed the typical spindle-shape fibroblast-like appearance (Figure 1A), while CAFs exhibited a more irregular and flattened morphology (Figure 1B).Morphology of isolated normal and tumor-derived fibroblasts.Light microscopic view showing the different morphology of fibroblasts isolated from human healthy mammary skin (A) or human breast cancer (B) samples after 6 days of culture. Original magnification, \u00d7200.Spatial distribution of tumor/fibroblast cells in 3D co-culturesRepresentative cytokeratin-stained sections from tumor/fibroblast nodule co-cultures (MCF-7/NFs, MCF-7/CAFs, MDA-MB-231/NFs, MDA-MB-231/CAFs) at day 6 are shown in Figure 2, indicating the spatial distribution of tumor cells (stained with the epithelial marker cytokeratin) and fibroblasts in this culture model. As expected, in MCF-7/fibroblast cell nodules fibroblasts were concentrated in the central zone leaving a strip of almost pure cancer cells at the periphery of the nodules. In the MDA-MB-231/fibroblast cell co-cultures, a more diffuse distribution of the two cell types was observed. In contrast to the less invasive MCF-7 cells, the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells extensively infiltrated the fibroblast core, particularly in the presence of CAFs.Spatial distribution of breast tumor cells and fibroblasts in nodule co-cultures.Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule co-cultures of either MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells with fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-cytokeratin (large spectrum, pankeratin) monoclonal antibody to identify the reciprocal location of the two cell types (tumor cells and fibroblasts) in the nodule co-cultures. The more invasive and less differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a looser association as compared to MCF-7/fibroblast co-cultures, with various cells infiltrating the fibroblast nodule core (arrows). DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification for upper panels (MCF-7/NFs, MCF-7/CAFs) and lower insets, \u00d7100; original magnification for lower panels (MDA-MB-231/NFs and MDA-MB-231/CAFs), \u00d7200.Similar cell distributions were observed at day 4 (data not shown).Highly invasive and metastatic breast tumor cells induced fibroblast activationThe immunocytochemical analysis for \u03b1-SMA, demonstrated that the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, when co-cultured with CAFs for 6 days, induced a sharp increase in the amount of \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal elements, indicating the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype, typical of the breast tumor stroma (Figure 3). The poorly invasive and low metastasizing MCF-7 breast cancer cells were not able to influence \u03b1-SMA expression of tumor-associated fibroblast population (Figure 3). Neither the highly nor the poorly invasive tumor cells were able to induce activation of normal fibroblasts (data not shown). The same results were obtained after 4 days of co-culturing (data not shown).Breast tumor cell induction of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in tumor stroma-derived fibroblasts.Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule culture (CAFs) and co-cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells with CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-\u03b1-SMA monoclonal antibody to verify the effect of breast cancer cells on fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. \u03b1-SMA expression was induced in the tumor-associated fibroblast population as a result of the interaction with the more aggressive and less differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrating the ability of these cells to promote stroma activation. DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification, \u00d7200.Cancer-associated fibroblasts exerted a mitogenic effect on breast tumor cellsTo investigate the reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts on their respective cell growth, immunohistochemical analysis of proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA) was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule sections. As shown in Figure 4A, Ki-67 mainly displayed a uniform nuclear staining. A weak cytoplasmic labelling was rarely observed but it did not interfere with the identification of positive nuclei. As expected, the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was significantly higher in breast tumor cells co-cultured for 6 days with CAFs compared with control MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cell homotypic cultures. In fact, the MCF-7 cell/CAF mixed nodules showed a significantly larger proportion (50%; p<0.001) of Ki67-positive tumor cells compared to MCF-7 cells cultured alone (34.8%) or in the presence of NFs (30.6%) (Figure 4A and 4B). The same CAF-triggered mitogenic effects were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells as the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells was higher (85%, p<0.001) compared to that of either MDA-MB-231 cell cultures or MDA-MB-231 cell/NF mixed nodules (61.7% and 60.3%, respectively) (Figure 4A and 4B). Mammary cancer cells seemed to have no influence on the growth of both kinds of fibroblasts. Similar results were obtained on 4-day co-cultures and with PCNA, even though a more heterogeneous and less intense nuclear staining was observed (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts but not their normal counterpart exerted mitogenic effect on breast cancer cells.(A) Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells) and co-cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells with NFs or CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibody (MIB-1 clone) to verify the reciprocal effect of the two cell types on their respective growth rate. The MCF-7 cell/CAF mixed nodules showed a higher number of Ki67-positive tumor cells with respect to that observed in MCF-7 cell/NF or MCF-7 cell nodules. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells and fibroblasts showed the same behavior as observed for MCF-7 cell/fibroblast nodule co-cultures.. DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification, \u00d7200. (B) Quantitative representation of the immunohistochemical data. Three sections, obtained from 3 different nodules, were analyzed by two independent observers. The number of Ki67-positive cells (on a total of at least 800 cells) was assessed in four randomized high-power fields (\u00d7400) for each section. A mean percentage for every sample was obtained and data were reported as mean\u00b1SD (error bars). Statistical significance was determined using ANOVA and the Tukey's multiple comparison test, *p<0.001.Cancer-associated and normal fibroblasts influenced E- and N-cadherin expression in breast tumor cellsTo test the reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts on the respective adhesiveness, a confocal immunofluorescence study of E- and N-cadherin expression was performed on nodule sections. The basal level of E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells is shown (Figure 5A) and quantified (Figure 5E). The analysis demonstrated the ability of NFs to induce E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells after 6 days of co-culture, when a great increase in signal intensity (\u223c2.5-fold, compared with MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures, Figure 5B, 5C and 5E) was observed. On the other hand, a CAF-triggered down-regulation of the adhesion molecule (\u223c80%, compared with MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures) was seen (Figure 5D and 5E). An increase in N-cadherin level was observed in CAFs, as the result of a 6-day long interaction with both kinds of epithelial cancer cells (up to \u223c180%, compared with CAF homotypic cultures). CAFs, in turn, promoted the up-regulation of N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells (\u223c60%, compared with MDA-MB-231 cell homotypic cultures). CAF-induced N-cadherin expression was found in the N-cadherin-negative MCF-7 cells. NFs were not able to influence N-cadherin expression in cancer cells, neither were they affected by tumor cells (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts and their normal counterpart affected E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells.Frozen nodule sections from MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures (A) or MCF-7 cell/fibroblast mixed cultures (B and D) were processed for E-cadherin immunostaining (Cy3: red). DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining (blue) (C). Confocal images show the up-regulation of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cell population co-cultured with NFs (B) as compared to the MCF-7 homotypic culture (A). On the contrary, interaction with CAFs promoted a strong reduction in E-cadherin expression (D). A representative experiment of three is shown. (E) F (a.u.), fluorescence intensity (in arbitrary units). Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05.For all the cell types similar results were obtained with 4-day co-cultures (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts induced vimentin expression in breast tumor cellsAs shown in Figure 6, the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin was clearly induced in the relatively well-differentiated breast cancer cells (MCF-7) co-cultured with CAFs. An up-regulation of the protein was observed in the poorly differentiated, mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells. NFs did not affect the expression of the marker in cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT in breast tumor cells.Western blot analysis revealed that the vimentin protein expression was clearly induced in the low-invasive MCF7 cell line co-cultured with CAFs. Vimentin levels were increased in the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs as compared with the control (MDA-MB-231 cells cultured alone). No effect on vimentin expression was found in breast tumor cells co-cultured with NFs.Breast tumor cells and fibroblasts reciprocally influenced cell membrane fluidityThe impact of fibroblast/tumour cell interplay on the respective plasma membrane lipid packing density was studied by means of a widely used membrane fluorescent probe (Laurdan), an amphiphilic molecule whose fluorescence emission is highly sensitive to the microenvironment polarity and viscosity. As a result of a 6-day interaction between tumor cells and fibroblasts in 2D co-cultures, a significant enhancement of both MCF-7 (Figure 7A and 7B) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 8A and 8B) cell membrane fluidity, demonstrated by reduction in GP values, was observed in the GP images and quantified within multiple Regions of Interest (plasma membranes of single cells) for each sample. On the other hand, the poorly invasive MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in the fibroblast membrane packing density (Figure 7A and 7B). After 6 days of co-culture, the GP values of MCF-7 cells and CAFs became nearly the same (GP\u223c0.30). Interestingly, this value corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the GP values of MCF-7 cells alone (GP\u223c0.34) and CAFs alone (GP\u223c0.26). As a result of MCF-7/NF interaction, the same phenomenon occurred (Figure 7A and 7B): the GP value of MCF-7 cells and NFs is again the same (GP\u223c0.32) and corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the GP values of control MCF-7 homotypic cultures (GP\u223c0.34) and control NF homotypic cultures (GP\u223c0.28).Low invasive breast cancer cells and fibroblasts reciprocally influenced their plasma membrane fluidity.Pseudocoloured GP images of living tumor (MCF-7) and fibroblast (NFs or CAFs) cells (A), and reciprocal effects on membrane fluidity (B) are shown. MCF-7 cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with Laurdan (2 \u00b5M). Tumor cell/fibroblast interaction determined an enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity. On the other hand, MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in fibroblast membrane packing density. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05 vs respective homotypic culture.Highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells underwent a plasma membrane fluidity increase when co-cultured with normal or cancer-associated fibroblasts.Pseudocoloured GP images of living tumor (MDA-MB-231) and fibroblast (NFs or CAFs) cells (A), and reciprocal effects on plasma membrane fluidity (B) are shown. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with Laurdan (2 \u00b5M). Tumor cell/fibroblast interaction determined an enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity, while MDA-MB-231 cells did not affect fibroblast membrane packing density. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05 vs respective homotypic culture.On the contrary, the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231cells left unchanged the fibroblast membrane packing density (Figure 8A and 8B).Cancer-associated and normal fibroblasts influenced migration velocity and directness of breast tumor cellsTo test whether fibroblast/cancer cell interactions could influence specific aspects of the cell migratory behaviour, such as velocity and directness, we used single cell tracking of living cells and time-lapse confocal microscopy. We obtained representative trajectory plots of MCF-7 (Figure 9A) or MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9D) evaluated over a time period of 45 min. As shown in Figure 9B, migration velocity was significantly increased in MCF-7 cells co-cultured with NFs () or CAFs (), compared with control MCF-7 homotypic cultures. CAFs seemed to be more efficacious than NFs in promoting this effect which was also associated with an increase in directness of MCF-7 cell movements (Figure 9A, 9B and 9C). The same effects were obtained when the more invasive MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with fibroblasts (Figure 9D, 9E and 9F). On the other hand, the presence of breast cancer cells did not affect the migratory ability of either NFs or CAFs (data not shown).Breast tumor cells displayed increased migration velocity and directness in vitro due to their interaction with fibroblasts.Representative trajectory plots of MCF-7 (A) or MDA-MB-231 cells (D) evaluated over a time period of 45 min. Cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with the CellTracker Green CMFDA. The starting point of each cell trajectory is plotted at the center of the graph. A significant increment of migration velocity (in \u00b5m/min) of MCF-7 (B) or MDA-MB-231 (E) cells was induced by the interaction with both CAFs and NFs. A marked enhancement of the tumor cell migration directness was promoted by CAFs in MCF-7 (A, D) or MDA-MB-231 (C, F) cells. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05.DiscussionThe influence of the surrounding stromal environment on breast cancer cell behaviour has been widely recognized but the parameters involved and their relationship are still far from being fully elucidated. Defining the differences between the so called reactive stroma of breast tumors and the normal stroma in terms of their influence on tumor cell migratory/invasive properties is therefore of great interest to deepen the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible of cancer progression and metastasis. In this paper, we used conventional 2D monolayer or 3D cultures to investigate the reciprocal influence occurring between breast cancer cells with different degree of differentiation/invasiveness and fibroblasts derived from breast cancer stroma (CAFs) or their normal counterpart (NFs) on some structural and functional features strongly correlated with the invasive/metastasizing phenotype. We found an overall migration/invasion-promoting effect of CAFs on both low and highly invasive mammary cancer cells, as demonstrated by their ability to increase tumor cell growth, promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reduction of cell adhesion, enhancement of membrane fluidity, and migration velocity and directness. These effects were not found or were less intense when cancer cells were grown with NFs under the same experimental conditions. Notably, NFs seem to favour the maintenance of the normal tissue architecture strongly promoting E-cadherin expression. Based on these findings, we conclude that in these experimental models CAFs are able to interact with cancer cells and modulate their migratory behaviour with a greater efficiency, if compared to NFs.In regard to the effect of tumor cell/stroma interaction on cell growth, cohabiting with CAFs induced a clear mitogenic response in both low and highly invasive breast cancer cells, in agreement with previous studies. The MCF-7 cell/CAF and MDA-MB-231/CAF mixed nodules showed a significantly larger proportion of Ki67- or PCNA-positive tumor cells with respect to that observed in the homotypic cultures as well as in the mixed nodule sections of tumor cells and NFs. Even though mammary cancer cells seemed to have no influence on the fibroblast growth, the more invasive and metastatic ones promoted fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. This effect was revealed by the sharp increase in the percentage of \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal elements found in the CAF population co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells which indicates the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype, typical of the breast tumor stroma activation. Consistent with data by other authors, these findings suggest that \u03b1-SMA expression in stromal fibroblast (fibroblast activation in tumor stroma) is influenced by the interacting cancer cell type.Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterizes progression of many types of carcinomas. Changes in intercellular adhesions mediate this switch and dictate the cell receptivity towards signals from the extracellular milieu. In particular, down-regulation or loss of the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin represents a key step in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype for many tumors. This event is frequently associated with the up-regulation of the mesenchymal adhesion protein N-cadherin, strongly influencing cell motility. Indeed, N-cadherin was shown to be expressed in the most invasive and dedifferentiated breast cancer cell lines and its exogenous expression in malignant cells induces a motile scattered phenotype also enabling circulating tumor cells to associate with stromal and endothelial cells at distant sites. A significant result of the present study is NFs' ability to induce a strong E-cadherin enhancement in MCF-7 cells, demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on frozen nodule sections. This result disagrees with recent findings by Gao et al., who described a NF-triggered down-regulation of E-cadherin in the same tumor cells by Western blot analysis. On the other hand, consistent with data from these authors, we observed a CAF-triggered reduction of this adhesion molecule. For the first time, in our experience an increase in N-cadherin level was observed in CAFs, but not in NFs, as the result of the interaction with both low and highly invasive breast cancer cells. CAFs, in turn, promoted the up-regulation of N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells and, as previously reported, its de novo expression in MCF-7 cells. The EMT-promoting activity of CAFs, demonstrated by their ability to trigger \u201ccadherin switching\u201d, was corroborated by the induction of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in the well differentiated MCF-7 cells and its up-regulation in the highly dedifferentiated MDA-MB-231 cells. It is conceivable that these CAF-promoted molecular changes of the tumor cell phenotype could have relevant implications in cancer progression and metastasis, not only promoting invasiveness, but also enabling interactions between tumor cells and the N-cadherin-expressing elements of the surrounding microenvironment, also in metastatic niches.Changes in the motional freedom of lipids and protein molecules in the cellular membrane represent a critical feature of pathological cells, influencing several aspects of their behaviour such as the response to chemotherapeutic agents, availability or activation of membrane receptors, migratory, invasive and/or metastatic potential. Even though no univocal trend is evident regarding the direction of alterations in tumor cell membrane fluidity, in most tumors malignant cell membranes have been found to possess higher fluidity than those of their healthy counterparts. It has also been shown that such structural change significantly correlates with an increased migratory/invasive aptitude and malignant potential of tumor cells as well as with a poor prognosis. Therefore, in the present study, two-photon microscopy imaging of cells labelled with the membrane fluorescent probe Laurdan was used to investigate whether fluidity changes in plasma membranes could occur as a result of tumor cell/fibroblast co-culturing. For the first time, we showed that such heterotypic interaction determined a significant enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity. On the other hand, the more differentiated and poorly invasive MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in fibroblast membrane packing density whose significance remains to be elucidated.Cell adhesion, changes in membrane phase properties and migration are complex and inter-dependent cellular processes, whose alterations characterize EMT and lead to the acquisition of a more motile phenotype by cancer cells, allowing for tumour invasion and dissemination.Hence, we finally studied the reciprocal influences of stromal and cancer cells on their respective migratory ability. The interaction of both poorly and highly invasive mammary cancer cells with NFs or CAFs determined a definite increment in tumor cell migration velocity. As expected, this migration-promoting activity was particularly noticeable for CAFs which were able to induce even a marked enhancement of the migration directness of breast tumor cells. On the other hand, no influence of breast cancer cells on the fibroblast migratory ability was detected. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first evidence of the ability of fibroblasts residing in breast tumor stroma to promote both speed and directness of cancer cell migration. In addition, they support results obtained from membrane fluidity analysis.Directional persistence, indicating the existence of a preferential cell track for migration, is an important component of cell motility controlled by multiple factors which include topography of the extracellular environment as well as intrinsic cell properties. It seems conceivable that stroma-induced alterations in specific tumor cell processes, such as cytoskeletal organization, integrin-mediated cell/substratum adhesion or intracellular force creation, have a part in triggering such effect. Future efforts will need to elucidate the CAF-mediated processes that drive tumor cells to migrate on preferential tracks.In summary, our study provides a further insight into the mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression, revealing novel aspects of the reciprocal interactions occurring between malignant cells and the neighbouring fibroblast population. In particular, an overall progression- and invasion-promoting effect of CAFs on both well- and poorly-differentiated mammary cancer cells was expressed as their ability in inducing structural and functional changes favouring the acquisition of a motile and invasive phenotype. Moreover, the tumor cell-triggered enhancement in N-cadherin and \u03b1-SMA levels of CAFs, together with MCF-7 cell-induced rigidification of fibroblast membrane, seems to reflect the ability of breast cancer cells to induce changes in the stromal cell microenvironment, whose significance deserves to be deepened. Defining the reciprocal influence of CAFs and mammary cancer cells on specific cell properties which promote tumor invasion and shedding light on the molecular mechanisms that subtend these effects may help in identifying new key regulators of breast tumor progression.ReferencesBreast stroma plays a dominant regulatory role in breast epithelial growth and differentiation: implications for tumor development and progressionStromal effects on mammary gland development and breast cancerThe role of the microenvironment in mammary gland development and cancerHeterotypic signaling between epithelial tumor cells and fibroblasts in carcinoma formationFibroblasts promote breast cancer cell invasion by upregulating tumor matrix metalloproteinase-9 productionMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerRegulation of in situ to invasive breast carcinoma transitionStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionTumor-associated fibroblasts (part II): Functional impact on tumor tissueInduction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in PMC42-LA human breast carcinoma cells by carcinoma-associated fibroblast secreted factorsEpithelial and stromal cathepsin K and CXCL14 expression in breast tumor progressionBreast cancer cells induce cancer-associated fibroblasts to secrete hepatocyte growth factor to enhance breast tumorigenesisCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts activate progesterone receptors and induce hormone independent mammary tumor growth: A role for the FGF-2/FGFR-2 axisGenetic events and the role of TGF\u03b2 in epithelial tumor progressionMalignant breast epithelium selects for insulin-like growth factor II expression in breast stroma: evidence for paracrine functionFibroblast-mediated acceleration of human epithelial tumor growth in vivoReconstruction of functionally normal and malignant human breast tissues in micePeripheral lymph node stromal cells can promote growth and tumorigenicity of breast carcinoma cells through the release of IGF-I and EGFTumor-stromal interactions reciprocally modulate gene expression patterns during carcinogenesis and metastasisInfluence of the interaction between nodal fibroblast and breast cancer cells on gene expressionCharacterization of heterotypic interaction effects in vitro to deconvolute global gene expression profiles in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of co-cultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsA method for three-dimensional coculture of cancer cells combined to any other type of cells maintained organotypicallyJanus-faced liposomes enhance antimicrobial innate immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infectionPE_PGRS30 is required for the full virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosisCalmodulin-dependent kinase IV links Toll-like receptor 4 signaling with survival pathway of activated dendritic cellsLow density lipoprotein misfolding and amyloidogenesisDynamic organization of lymphocyte plasma membrane: lessons from advanced imaging methodsVisualizing lipid structure and raft domains in living cells with two-photon microscopyHeat stress causes spatially-distinct membrane re-modelling in K562 leukemia cellsHigh-resolution imaging of redox signaling in live cells through an oxidation-sensitive yellow fluorescent proteinInvestigation of the spatial distribution of glutathione redox-balance in live cells by using Fluorescence Ratio Imaging MicroscopyCan redox-sensitive fluorescent probes measure intracellular redox potentials?Compartmentalization of the redox environment in PC-12 neuronal cellsNutrient withdrawal rescues growth factor-deprived cells from mTOR-dependent damageMammalian life-span determinant p66 shcA mediates obesity-induced insulin resistanceControlled self assembly of collagen nanoparticleRole of the life span determinant P66shcA in ethanol-induced liver damageImaging in Cell and Developmental BiologyFeature point tracking and trajectory analysis for video imaging in cell biologyMardia Kanti V, Jupp PE (1999) Directional Statistics.

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

Generally, BC subtypes are classified by the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2). In this context, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), coined under this term due to the lack of ER, PR and HER-2 expression, is considered the breast malignant subtype associated with the least favorable therapeutic options and clinical outcomes. Although chemotherapy remains the backbone of treatment for TNBC patients, the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shown promising responses in those patients with early-stage TNBC. Therefore, the identification of novel biomarkers as suitable therapeutic targets for metastatic TNBCs could facilitate combinatorial personalized treatments as well as better clinical outcomes.Among the potential prognostic biomarkers for TNBC, increasing attention has been recently center around the role of S100 proteins, a large family of calcium-binding cytosolic proteins tightly linked to inflammatory disorders, neurological pathologies and even progression of diverse tumors, including BC. Within the S100-Ca2+ binding protein family, elevated levels of S100A8 and S100A9 have been detected in ER-negative and TNBC patient cohorts. Of clinical relevance, high percentage of infiltrating S100A8+ myeloid cells as well as S100A9 expression have been proposed to represent a potential mechanism driving worse prognosis in BC, mostly in TNBC basal-like subtypes. Mechanistically, S100A8 and S100A9 act as a hetero-complex damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), namely calprotectin, by binding cell surface proteins like the immunoglobulin Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), thereby initiating the modulation of a wide range of pro-inflammatory responses and oncogenic signaling. Of note, RAGE has been suggested as a suitable candidate biomarker for TNBC diagnosis on the basis of its up-regulation and association with a poor prognosis in invasive and metastatic TNBCs. In addition, RAGE has been shown to drive cell invasiveness and metastasis in different TNBC models by regulating both tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic cell effects. In accordance with these findings, these processes were halted by targeting RAGE. In addition, S100A8/A9 binding to RAGE promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TNBC cells and lung metastasis in a TNBC xenograft mouse model. To date, pharmacological agents targeting RAGE tested in clinical trials have shown promising results for the treatment of certain disorders, such as cardiovascular-associated comorbidities, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and early stage of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, it remains to be assessed whether the tested drugs might be considered as potential anti-cancer therapeutics agents, including aggressive TNBCs.By decoding the oncogenic signaling circuitries involved in TNBC progression, emerging studies, including ours, have highlighted the role of the non-receptor focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the Hippo pathway component Yes-associated protein (YAP) in TNBC progression. Although fibroblast transition to a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like phenotype was inhibited by targeting both RAGE and integrin-mediated mechano-transduction that in turn resulted in the reduction of FAK activation and YAP nuclear localization, the functional connection of RAGE with FAK/Hippo/YAP pathway in TNBC is still poorly understood.Here, we show that S100A8/A9 activation of RAGE leads to actomyosin-mediated FAK activation, YAP nuclear accumulation and gene regulation in TNBC cells. Notably, both proliferative and migratory abilities of TNBC cells were suppressed by targeting the S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK-YAP circuitry. Our novel findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms initiated by RAGE in TNBC progression, suggesting the potential usefulness of agents targeting RAGE, as single agents or in combination treatments, in order to halt this highly metastatic breast malignancy.Materials and methodsBioinformatics analysisGene chip data expression analysis of S100A8 and S100A9 was performed using TNMplot differential gene expression analysis in Tumor, Normal and Metastatic tissues analyzer (https://tnmplot.com/analysis). p-value was determined by Mann_Whitney test. The TIMER2.0 database was used for S100A8 and S100A9 gene expression correlation in TNBC samples by selecting Spearman analysis methodology. Overall Survival (OS) and Relapse Free Survival (RFS) for S100A8 and S100A9 in breast cancer were generated by Kaplan-Meier Plotter for Breast Cancer (https://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&cancer=breast). Differential gene expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9 between normal, TNBC, HER2-positive, Luminal-A and Luminal-B BC subtypes were collected from Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2) database (http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#index) (p-value Cutoff was 0.01). GOBO gene expression-based outcome for breast cancer online tool provided by the Lund University (https://co.bmc.lu.se/gobo/gsa.pl) was used to further explore S100A8 and S100A9 expression in BC subtypes as well as the combined S100A8/A9 expression among all BC subgroups. Gene expression data in breast cancer were also obtained from Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) in cBioPortal database (https://www.cbioportal.org/). The mRNA expression Z-scores and information on the clinical samples corresponding to patients with BC were collected from cBioPortal. To categorize genes into molecular pathways based on gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) or KEGG pathway analysis, we employed the WEB-based Gene SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) (http://www.webgestalt.org/) and Enrichr (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/) programs, respectively. For the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, we divided METABRIC data into low and high groups for the expression of RAGE based on the cut-off of Z-score of 1. We analyzed the OS time between the groups by log-rank test. In addition, multivariate statistical technique was performed using Cox proportional hazards model. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and JMP Pro 15 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Volcano plot was generated by Appyters, whereas Venn Diagram was prepared by Canva program (https://www.canva.com).Meta-analysisWe searched the public database PROGgeneV2, which collects data in association with cohort studies from public repositories such as TCGA, GEO, and EBI Array Express.

For transwell migration assay performed in the presence of siRNAs, BT-549 TNBC cells overexpressing RAGE were transfected with siRNA targeting Control (20\u2009nM) and siRNA targeting FLNA (20\u2009nM), and after 72\u2009hours cells were trypsinized, counted and 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells were seeded onto the upper membrane of the chamber in serum-free medium and stimulated with rhS100A8/A9 (100ng/ml), while remaining cells were processed to ascertain FLNA knockdown by RT-PCR. 4\u2009hours after incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C, medium was removed from the chambers, cells were washed twice with 1X PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde diluted in 1X PBS at room temperature for 2\u2009minutes, washed twice with 1X PBS and permeabilized with 100% methanol at room temperature for 20\u2009minutes. Then, methanol was removed, chambers were washed twice with 1X PBS and stained by using Giemsa solution for 15\u2009minutes at room temperature. Finally, Giemsa solution was removed and chambers were washed twice with 1X PBS. No-migrated cells were removed by cotton swabs while migrated cells were counted under the microscope.Statistical analysisThe differences between experimental groups were analyzed using ANOVA and independent t-tests.

Likewise, the up-regulation of S100A8/A9 hetero-complex has been tightly linked to poor prognostic clinical indicators in BC patients. Therefore, we began our study evaluating the expression levels and clinical significance of S1008 and S100A9 in BC by querying available online bioinformatics tools. Analyzing gene chip based data derived from TNM-plot analyzer (https://tnmplot.com/analysis/), we found significantly higher expression levels of both S100A8 and S100A9 in breast tumor samples respect to normal breast tissues (Fig. 1A-B). In addition, we detected a significant reduced expression of S100A8 and S100A9 when comparing BC metastatic samples with normal breast tissues (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Supplementary Fig. S1A-F). Moreover, the expression of S100A9 was found significantly down-regulated in BC metastatic samples respect to breast tumor samples (Additional file 1: Supplementary Fig. S1E-F). To gain a clinical perspective of the relevance of these findings, we first used the Kaplan-Meier Plotter analysis of Breast Cancer (https://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&cancer=breast). This approach showed lower OS (n\u2009=\u20091879) as well as RFS (n\u2009=\u20094929) rates in BC patients harboring high levels of S100A8 and S100A9 with respect to patients exhibiting reduced levels (Fig. 1C-D). To strengthen this remarkable prognostic indication, we also conducted a meta-analysis study by elaborating clinical data derived from numerous BC datasets. This investigation nicely confirmed that high expression of both S100A8 and S100A9 is associated with a worse clinical outcome in BC patients (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Supplementary Fig. S2A-C). Aiming at further characterizing the significance of S100A8 and S100A9 in breast malignancy, we defined their expression pattern among the different breast tumor subclasses. Using the GEPIA2 database (http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#index), we found higher expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9 in TNBC subtype compared to the normal breast counterpart (Additional\u00a0file\u00a03: Supplementary Fig. S3A-B). Moreover, we assessed a correlation between S100A8 and S100A9 expression levels in TNBC samples (Additional file 3: Supplementary Fig. S3C). On the contrary, Luminal-A and Luminal-B BC subtypes showed a lower expression of both S100A8 and S100A9 respect to normal breast tissues (Additional file 3: Supplementary Fig. S3D-E). Interestingly, comparing all BC subtypes we found that TNBC and HER2 positive BC subgroups exhibit the highest expression levels of S100A8 and S100A9, as determined exploring two diverse public BC datasets (Additional file 3: Supplementary Fig. S3F-G; Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Supplementary Fig. S4A-C). Overall, these data suggest that S100A8 and S100A9 may be considered as prognostic indicators in HER2-positive and TNBC BC phenotypes.Increased RAGE expression correlates with worse prognostic hallmarks in breast cancer.

B Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model linking RAGE expression pattern to breast tumor stage, histological grade and receptor expression pattern, respectively. C Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) box plot of RAGE in TNBC, HER2-positive, Luminal-A and Luminal-B breast cancer subclasses. D Working hypothesis postulating the potential putative binding site of S100A8/A9 on the V-domain of RAGERAGE has been proposed as a potential mediator of oncogenic effects elicited by S100A8/A9 complex in diverse malignancies, including BC. Therefore, we focused on RAGE taking also into account its elevated expression levels in TNBCs and node-positive BC tissues and that RAGE expression increases with breast tumor size. Evaluating the METABRIC Breast Cancer cohort (https://www.cbioportal.org/), we found that the OS in BC patients exhibiting high expression levels of RAGE was poorer respect to patients harboring low expression levels of RAGE (Fig. 2A). We also observed an association, although not significant, between high RAGE expression and reduced OS in BC through a meta-analysis network including different BC cohorts (Additional\u00a0file\u00a05: Supplementary Fig. S5A-B). Of clinical relevance, a multivariate cox proportional hazard model analysis revealed that RAGE expression was an independent prognostic factors in BC patients when we took three clinically important factor such as T-stage, histological grade and receptor expression pattern into consideration for the multivariate analysis (Fig. 2B). Then, exploring the GEPIA2 database (http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#index), we observed higher (albeit not significant) expression levels of RAGE in TNBC respect to HER2-positive, Luminal-A and Luminal-B breast tumor subtypes (Fig. 2C). These findings suggest that RAGE may represent a candidate prognostic biomarker in breast malignancy. Altogether, our bioinformatics data prompted us to dissect the intracellular signaling network triggered by the S100A8/A9-RAGE system (Fig. 2D) in the context of the aggressive TNBC, for which there is an urgent need to identify novel signaling vulnerabilities toward more effective stratified therapies.S100A8/A9-RAGE system activates FAK through ROCK/myosin/Rho-A signaling in TNBC cellsS100A8/A9-RAGE signaling activates FAK in TNBC cells.

Results shown are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicateIn order to explore the signaling network activated by S100A8/A9-RAGE system in TNBC, we established stable overexpressing RAGE MDA-MB 231 and BT-549 cells. The transduction of RAGE overexpression vector resulted in a robust upregulation of RAGE at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3A-B). RAGE binding to S100A8/A9 was shown to promote chemoattractant-induced F-actin polymerization, thereby enhancing BC cell mesenchymal properties and EMT. Among the pivotal gatekeepers involved in the regulation of breast tumor cell cytoskeleton and actin re-organization, FAK plays an essential role in mediating crucial signals from Focal Adhesions (FAs) to cell survival, migration and transcriptional programs. In accordance with these findings, we observed the activation of FAK along with the phosphorylation of AKT upon S100A8/A9 treatment in TNBC cells overexpressing RAGE (Fig. 3C). These responses were prevented using the RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1 (Fig. 3D) and the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 (Fig. 3E), whereas the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib was able to abolish only AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3F), suggesting that S100A8/A9-RAGE system induces the activation of FAK that in turn triggers AKT phosphorylation in MDA-MB 231 TNBC cells. In order to establish a physiological condition, we interfered genetically with RAGE abrogating its expression. RAGE silencing abrogated FAK phosphorylation mediated by S100A/A9 in MDA-MB 231 and BT-549 TNBC cells (Additional\u00a0file\u00a06: Supplementary Fig. S6A-B). As observed in MDA-MB 231 cells, the pharmacological inhibition of RAGE and/or FAK prevented the activation of FAK triggered by S100A8/A9 also in BT-549 TNBC cells (Additional file 6: Supplementary Fig. S6C-D). Aiming to provide insights in the molecular mechanism involved in the activation of FAK by S100A8/A9-RAGE system, we performed further experiments using both pharmacological and genetic approaches in order to dissect mechanisms involved in the actin polymerization processes. In this vein, both the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and the myosin-II inhibitor Blebbistatin were found to repress FAK activation triggered by S100A8/A9-RAGE system in TNBC cells (Fig. 3G-H, Additional file 6: Supplementary Fig. S6E). Likewise, Rho-A knockdown prevented the phosphorylation of FAK induced by S100A8/A9-RAGE axis (Fig. 3I). Aligned with these data, the number of FAs observed upon S100A8/A9-RAGE activation was reduced by RAGE, FAK and ROCK inhibition (Fig. 3J-K). Cumulatively, these findings suggest that an acto-myosin dependent pathway is involved in the activation of FAK mediated by S100A8/A9-RAGE system in TNBC cells (Additional file 6: Supplementary Fig. S6F).Hippo pathway is enriched in BC lesions harboring high RAGE expression levelsHippo pathway is significantly enriched in high RAGE expression breast cancer cohort.

D Venn diagram of the shared up-regulated genes by TEAD2 and TEAD4 Hippo pathway TFs in high RAGE (Z-score\u2009>\u20091) expression breast cancer cohort. E Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) box plot of FLNA expression levels in TNBC, Luminal-A and Luminal-B breast cancer subtypesWe performed a bioinformatics analysis in order to identify molecular signatures potentially correlating with high RAGE expression levels in BC cohorts. In this vein, by exploring the METABRIC dataset in cBioportal (http://cbioportal.org) we first identified BC samples with high RAGE mRNA levels (Z-score\u2009>\u20091) respect to those exhibiting low RAGE expression levels (Z-score\u2009\u2264\u20091) (Fig.\u00a04A). Using the WebGestalt program, we then filtered only differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low RAGE expression BC subgroups (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, using the Enrichr analyzer, we identified the predicted Transcriptional Factors (TFs) whose function control the DEGs in the high RAGE expressing BC group, and used the WebGestalt program to identify pivotal KEGG pathways correlating with these TFs (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly, \u201cHippo signaling\u201d was the most significant activated pathway in the high RAGE expression BC cohort (q-value\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig. 4B). Precisely, \u201chsa04390\u201d Hippo signaling pathway ID incorporates 157 genes respect to \u201chsa04392\u201d Hippo signaling pathway ID, which combines 29 genes in the context of interspecies conservation (Fig. 4B). In both \u201chsa04390\u201d and \u201chsa04392\u201d Hippo signaling pathway IDs, the canonical Hippo pathway TFs TEAD2 and TEAD4 were found among the top 50 predicted TFs activated in the high RAGE expression BC cohort (Fig. 4C; Additional\u00a0file\u00a07: Supplementary Fig. S7A). In order to deepen our findings, we aimed to investigate the most relevant upregulated genes by TEAD2 and TEAD4 in the high RAGE expression BC cohort. To this end, we first established the target genes up-regulated by TEAD2 and TEAD4 (Z-score\u2009>\u20091), respectively (Additional file 7: Supplementary Fig. S7B), and then we filtered only the shared up-regulated genes by both TFs (Z-score\u2009>\u20091) (Fig. 4D). Among the identified up-regulated genes (Fig. 4D), we focused on the gene encoding the actin-crosslinking protein Filamin-A (FLNA), which plays a crucial role in both cytoskeleton remodeling and FAs turnover through the anchorage of a wide variety of adhesive proteins. FLNA has been closely associated with breast tumor progression and its inhibition has been shown to improve chemotherapy efficacy in TNBC. Considering that Filamin protein family consists of three different components (i.e. FLNA, FLNB and FLNC), we sought to determine their expression pattern comparing TNBC and luminal BC subtypes. Higher FLNA expression was detected in TNBC respect to luminal BC subgroup (Fig. 4E), whereas FLNB as well as FLNC expression levels were found higher in luminal breast tumors respect to TNBC (Additional file 7: Supplementary Fig. S7C-D). In addition, analyzing data from diverse BC cohorts we found an association albeit not significant between high FLNA expression and reduced OS in BC patients (Additional\u00a0file\u00a08: Supplementary Fig. S8A-B). Collectively, our data suggest that Hippo signaling may be involved in S100A8/A9-RAGE transcription circuitry resulting in the up-regulation of several target genes, including FLNA.The S100A8/A9-RAGE system activates Hippo/YAP pathway in TNBC cellsS100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK signaling triggers YAP activity in TNBC.

Results shown are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicateYAP is a key mediator of the Hippo pathway driving oncogenic effects in TNBC. The mechanisms triggering YAP activation in TNBC remain to be fully understood, albeit previous studies have identified certain YAP regulators. For instance, FAK has recently emerged as an important gatekeeper regulating YAP nuclear translocation and gene transcriptional programs toward uncontrolled growth effects and metastatic processes. Therefore, we attempted to examine whether S100A8/A9-RAGE system along with FAK can activate YAP in TNBC cells overexpressing RAGE. Notably, we found that S100A8/A9 exposure reduces YAP phosphorylation, thereby reflecting its activation in TNBC cells (Fig.\u00a05A-B; Additional\u00a0file\u00a09: Supplementary Fig. S9A-B). Moreover, S100A8/A9-mediated YAP activation was reversed by inhibiting either RAGE (Fig. 5A; Additional file 9: Supplementary Fig. S9A) or FAK (Fig. 5B; Additional file 9: Supplementary Fig. S9B). To confirm the activation of YAP signaling in our model system, we assessed that S100A8/A9 treatment abrogates the phosphorylation of MST1/2, which may act as main core regulatory proteins in Hippo pathway (Fig. 5A-B). Of note, this effect was no longer evident by interfering with RAGE (Fig. 5A) or FAK (Fig. 5B). Next, we performed knock-down experiments to further assess the involvement of S100A8/A9/RAGE/FAK axis in the control of YAP activation. In this vein, we determined that the silencing of RAGE as well as FAK expression prevents YAP activation induced by S100A8/A9 in TNBC cells over-expressing RAGE (Additional file 9: Supplementary Fig. S9C-D). Likewise, the nuclear accumulation of YAP induced by S100A8/A9 was blunted interfering with RAGE and FAK, as determined through the quantification of YAP immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5C-D) and analyzing nuclear/cytoplasmic cellular fraction (Fig. 5E). Under-phosphorylated and activated YAP shifts from cytoplasm into nucleus, where it binds to TEAD transcription factors acting as a co-activator for gene expression responses. Therefore, the functional impact of S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK system on YAP was confirmed by YAP/TAZ luciferase reporter assays (Fig. 5F). In addition, the S100A8/A9-regulated expression of Hippo/YAP canonical targets, CTGF and Cyr61, was abrogated targeting RAGE and FAK (Additional\u00a0file\u00a010: Supplementary Fig. S10A-D).FLNA is upregulated by S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK-YAP transduction network in TNBC.

Results shown are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicateConsidering that FLNA was identified among the top up-regulated genes by TEAD2/TEAD4 Hippo pathway transcription factors in the high RAGE expression BC cohort (See Fig. 4), we sought to assess whether S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK signaling along with YAP can regulate the expression of FLNA in TNBC cells. Of note, the S100A8/A9-induced mRNA expression of FLNA was prevented using the RAGE antagonist FPS-ZM1 or the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 as well as disrupting YAP-TEAD interaction by using verteporfin (Fig. 6A). Corroborating these results, we also analyzed the expression of FLNA by immunofluorescence microscopy. The increased abundance as well as the median fluorescence intensity of cytoplasmic FLNA observed upon S100A8/A9 exposure, were significantly reduced by the pharmacological inhibition of RAGE, FAK and YAP-TEAD binding (Fig. 6B-C). Taken together, these results suggest that RAGE and FAK regulate YAP activity in TNBC cells, resulting in increased FLNA expression among other Hippo pathway-target genes.S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK-YAP transduction signaling stimulates growth and migration of TNBC cellsS100A8/A9-RAGE system prompts growth effects in TNBC cells.

On the other hand, the growth of BC cells as well as TNBC tumor progression has been halted targeting RAGE by different approaches such as using monoclonal antibody therapy, and genetic and/or pharmacological strategies. FAK inhibition also suppressed breast primary tumor development and anchorage-independent growth of TNBC cells. Consistent with these observations, in the present study we ascertained that upon S100A8/A9 stimulation the proliferative responses of TNBC cells over-expressing RAGE were prevented by RAGE or FAK pharmacological inhibition (Fig. 7A-B) as well as knocking down the expression of RAGE, FAK and YAP (Additional\u00a0file\u00a011: Supplementary Fig. S11A-D). Likewise, targeting RAGE and FAK lowered the number of colonies triggered by S100A8/A9 treatment (Fig. 7C-D). In addition, the growth stimulation induced by the S100A8/A9-RAGE system was blunted silencing the expression of the Hippo/YAP canonical target CTGF (Fig. 7E-H). Together, these data suggest that S100A8/A9-RAGE system engages the downstream FAK-Hippo/YAP signaling to promote the growth of TNBC cells.S100A8/A9-RAGE system increases the migration of TNBC cells.

A Cartoon depicting the proposed S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK-YAP transduction network in TNBC cells. Targeting RAGE along with FAK/YAP-dependent transcriptional programs may disable the growth and migration of TNBC cellsConsidering that the interaction between S100 Ca2+-binding proteins and RAGE promotes tumor progression also stimulating invasive effects, we next aimed to explore whether S100A8/A9-RAGE activation prompts the migration of TNBC cells. S100A8/A9 treatment stimulated migratory effects in TNBC cells overexpressing RAGE, however these responses were reduced targeting either RAGE or FAK and by knocking-down the expression of the YAP/TEAD target FLNA (Fig. 8A-K). Collectively, our findings suggest that S100A8/A9-RAGE system induces aberrant growth and migration of TNBC cells by engaging both FAK and Hippo/YAP signal transduction mediators (Fig. 9A).DiscussionThe development and widespread advances on \u2018omics\u2019 technologies are consistently improving the characterization of the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of TNBC ecosystem, which remains the BC subtype with a poorer differentiation, and the highest early tendency of metastasis and recurrence than other BC phenotypes. Indeed, metastatic spread is the main hurdle for the therapeutic benefits in patients with early and advanced TNBC. The combination of ICIs with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents provides new therapeutic opportunities for TNBC patients. However, there is still a compelling need to identify novel prognostic biomarkers that be also useful as potential molecular targets that might synergize with immunotherapy and improve personalized therapeutic responses in TNBC patients. For instance, an aberrant expression of S100A8 and S100A9 Ca2\u00a0+\u2009\u2212-binding proteins has been detected in BC cohorts and correlated with the loss of ER in breast malignancy. Mechanistically, S100A8/A9 hetero-complex can drive oncogenic signaling pathways and transcriptional responses toward the onset of breast malignant phenotypes. However, the elucidation of S100A8/A9-mediated downstream transduction mechanisms, particularly in the high metastatic TNBC subtype, has not been yet fully explored.Here, we first showed that the up-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 expression is significantly associated with worse survival rates in BC patients and highly expressed in HER2-positive and TNBC rather than Luminal BC subtypes. We then assessed that the over-expression of RAGE, which acts as one of the main binding surface receptor for S100A8/A9 heterodimer, correlates with a poor OS in BC patients and is also prominently detected in TNBC. Taking advantage of TNBC cells engineered to stably overexpress RAGE, we have unveiled novel insights on the molecular mechanisms by which S100A8/A9-RAGE system may act in TNBC. In this regard, we found that S100A8/A9-induced RAGE activation primes FAK phosphorylation as well as the formation of FAs that in turn promote YAP nuclear accumulation and gene transcription programs. Biologically, we found that the S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK-YAP signaling circuitry promotes the growth and migratory responses of TNBC cells.Evidence from pre-clinical and clinical investigation have established S100A8 and its cognate-binding partner S100A9 as a potential prognostic biomarkers for reactivation of dormant tumor cells, prediction of metastatic risk and therapeutic responses failure in several malignancies, including BC. Aligned with these studies, a poor OS in BC patients has been observed in the presence of high S100A9 expression levels, whereas higher S100A8 expression in both stromal and BC cells has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. Of note, our bioinformatics investigation has revealed that S100A8 and S100A9 are greatly expressed in breast tumor tissues rather than in its normal counterpart. This clinical feature was not evident analyzing the expression of both S100A8 and S100A9 in BC metastatic tissues, probably due to the heterogeneity of expression patterns as well as the low number of metastatic samples. Remarkably, we found that high expression of both S100A8 and S100A9 correlates with a decreased OS and RFS rates in BC patients. Moreover, through the in depth analysis of large publicly available databases, we show that TNBC, unlike Luminal-A and Luminal-B BC subtypes, harbors higher levels of both S100A8 and S100A9 respect to non-tumor breast tissues. In addition, we found increased levels of S100A8 and S100A9 in TNBC and HER2-positive BC subtypes compared to Luminal-A and Luminal-B breast tumor subgroups, respectively, and we also highlight a strong correlation between S100A8 and S100A9 gene expression levels in TNBC.Several pre-clinical studies have indicated RAGE as an attractive pharmacological target to halt primary tumor growth and recurrence of metastatic lesions. Although not much has been determined about the predictive clinical significance and functional role of RAGE in BC, previous findings have proposed RAGE as a potential candidate biomarker for breast tumor development and progression, and as a promising therapeutic approach for the high invasive TNBC. In the present study, we show that high RAGE expression levels are significantly correlated with worse survival in BC patients. We also noticed that increased RAGE expression may serve as an additional covariate to be included among the prognostic factors in BC patients. Further investigating the expression of RAGE among the BC subtypes, we showed an enhanced, albeit not significant, expression of RAGE in TNBC, thus confirming previous studies detecting high RAGE levels in TNBC tissues.RAGE is a multi-ligand pattern recognition receptor binding to several ligands such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs), high mobility group box-1 peptide (HMGB-1), amyloid-\u03b2 peptides and the S100-Ca2+ family proteins. Upon stimulation, RAGE activates several oncogenic signaling pathways and gene expression programs which in turn promote pro-inflammatory responses and malignant progression. Particularly, interfering with RAGE-ligand mediated signaling impairs cell viability, adhesion, migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Here, we have elucidated a novel intracellular molecular signaling network triggered by S100A8/A9-RAGE system in TNBC by using TNBC cell lines stably engineered to overexpress RAGE. We demonstrate that S100A8/A9-RAGE system triggers FAK as well as AKT activation in TNBC cells, as evaluated using selective pharmacological agents and genetic approaches. In order to further dissect the mechanism by which S100A8/A9-RAGE system primes FAK activation, we determined the engagement of ROCK/myosin/Rho-A cytoskeleton mechanical transducers, strengthening previous studies showing the involvement of cytoskeletal partners in the mechanical stretch-dependent FAK phosphorylation.Although FAK has emerged as a key upstream mediator in controlling the mechanical cue-driven Hippo/YAP pathway activities in diverse malignant frameworks, the role of S100 Ca2+-proteins/RAGE system in this context has not been yet fully investigated. Only recently, it has been demonstrated that AGEs-RAGE may cooperate with the integrin receptors in promoting YAP nuclear accumulation through an enriched glycated extracellular matrix-dependent manner. Intriguingly, in our study we have discovered that Hippo pathway is the most enriched signaling in BC patients with high RAGE expression respect to those patients with low levels of RAGE. Moreover, we have also identified the main significant up-regulated Hippo-TFs in BC patients harboring high RAGE expression levels and, among the downstream target genes up-regulated by the canonical YAP interactors TEAD2 and TEAD4 Hippo TF family members, we have detected FLNA as the pivotal downstream gene correlated to extracellular matrix or cytoskeleton-related pathways leading to cancer cell invasive features. Nicely fittings with these findings, we found that FLNA, unlike FLNB and FLNC, is highly expressed in TNBC rather than in Luminal BC subtypes. Furthermore, we determined that the S100A8/A9-RAGE system along with FAK trigger YAP activation and subsequent nuclear accumulation, thereby turning-on the transcription of Hippo canonical targets CTGF and Cyr61, as well as FLNA. Overall, our study supports the existence of a novel S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK signaling mechanism controlling the Hippo/YAP pathway and its downstream targets, thereby increasing the growth and migration of TNBC cells. Recently, the discovery of a novel molecular framework has revealed that S100-Ca2+ binding proteins along with RAGE may contribute to the development of radiotherapy-resistant brain metastatic cancer cells, which were derived from different primary tumors including TNBC. Interestingly, a significant reduction of metastasis in a TNBC brain metastatic syngeneic mouse model was observed lowering S100A9 levels along with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) treatment. Targeting the S100A9-RAGE axis with the antagonist FPS-ZM1 resulted in potentiated benefits of radiation without evidence of increased toxicity, therefore providing the rationale for a novel combination therapy to overcome radio-resistance in brain metastasis. In accordance with these findings, our data raise the possibility to target the S100A8/A9-RAGE-FAK-Hippo/YAP axis for novel therapeutic intervention in TNBC patients, as depicted in Fig. 9.ConclusionOur study has revealed that both S100A8/A9 and RAGE correlate with poor clinical outcomes in BC patients and are highly expressed in TNBC subtype. Mechanistically, S100A8/A9-RAGE system promotes FAK phosphorylation and regulates the Hippo pathway, thus increasing YAP nuclear localization and gene transcription activities that stimulate the growth and migration of TNBC cells. Therefore, the comprehensive analysis of S100-Ca2+ binding proteins and RAGE expression profile could be useful for the assessment of BC diagnosis, prognosis and new therapeutic strategies halting TNBC progression.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsTNBCTriple-Negative Breast CancerBCBreast CancerEREstrogen ReceptorPRProgesterone ReceptorHer-2Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2ICIsImmune Checkpoint InhibitorsDAMPDamage-Associated Molecular PatternRAGEReceptor for Advanced Glycation End-productsEMTEpithelial-Mesenchymal TransitionFAKFocal Adhesion KinaseYAPYes-Associated ProteinCAFCancer-Associated FibroblastOSOverall SurvivalRFSRelapse Free SurvivalGEPIA2Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2METABRICMolecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International ConsortiumGSEAGene Set Enrichment AnalysisWebGestaltWEB-based Gene SeT AnaLysisFAsFocal AdhesionsDEGsDifferentially Expressed GenesTFsTranscriptional FactorsFLNAFilamin-AAGEsAdvanced Glycation End ProductsHMGB-1High Mobility Group Box-1Publisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsDCR, JSG, AB and MM conceived the study, analyzed and interpreted the data.

Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer.

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

        "title": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Promotes the Differentiation of Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts, Induced by Breast Cancer Cells.",
        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "title": "Invasive breast cancer induces laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in myofibroblasts to confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling.",
        "content": "Although development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling is known to be associated with tumor invasion, the mechanism by which myofibroblasts become resistant to anoikis is unknown. We previously demonstrated laminin-332 upregulation in the fibrosis around invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Because laminin-332 promotes cell survival through binding to integrins, we hypothesized that invasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts by upregulating laminin-332 expression during tissue remodeling. Here, we demonstrate that invasive breast cancer cells induce laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in myofibroblasts to confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype. Three types of fibroblasts were isolated from the tumor burden, the fibrosis, and normal tissue of patients with early stage IDC (less than 10 mm diameter), designated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), interface fibroblasts (InFs), and normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs), respectively. To investigate direct and indirect crosstalk with tumor cells, fibroblasts were co-cultured with invasive MDA-MB-231 or noninvasive MCF7 cells or in conditioned medium. Anoikis resistance of fibroblasts was measured by cell viability and caspase-3 activity after incubation on poly-HEMA coated plates for 72 hours. Involvement of laminin-332/integrin \u03b13\u03b21 or \u03b16\u03b24 signaling in anoikis resistance was confirmed by treatment with purified laminin-332 or blocking antibodies against laminin-332, integrin \u03b21, or integrin \u03b24. MDA-MB-231 cells induced laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in fibroblasts, leading to anoikis resistance. InFs showed a higher endogenous level of laminin-332 than did CAFs and NBFs. After stimulation with MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium, laminin-332 expression of InFs was dramatically increased and maintained under anoikis conditions. Laminin-332 upregulation was also observed in CAFs and NBFs, but at a lower level than in InFs. Laminin-332 induced Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation by binding to integrin \u03b13\u03b21. Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression induced laminin-332-independent Rac1 activation and promoted anoikis resistance in fibroblasts approximately twofold more effectively than did laminin-332, regardless of the type of fibroblast. In addition, integrin \u03b24 expression suppressed fibroblast aggregation in conditions of anoikis. Invasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling by inducing laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Interface fibroblasts appear to be the primary myofibroblasts that interact with invasive tumor cells during tissue remodeling.",

Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression induced laminin-332-independent Rac1 activation and promoted anoikis resistance in fibroblasts approximately twofold more effectively than did laminin-332, regardless of the type of fibroblast. In addition, integrin \u03b24 expression suppressed fibroblast aggregation in conditions of anoikis.ConclusionInvasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling by inducing laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Interface fibroblasts appear to be the primary myofibroblasts that interact with invasive tumor cells during tissue remodeling.IntroductionA fundamental component of tumor invasion is stromal tissue remodeling, which involves proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and results in anoikis (a form of caspase-dependent apoptosis that is caused by loss of integrin binding of stromal cells). As a component of stroma, myofibroblasts are also exposed to anoikis during tissue remodeling. However, many studies have reported prolonged survival of myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling in patients with fibrotic diseases. Fibrosis is considered an indicator of tissue remodeling and is commonly formed around invasive types of tumors. Considering that myofibroblasts are key regulators of tissue remodeling and a major source of ECM production, which drives tumor progression, the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts may be an essential event during stromal tissue remodeling before tumor invasion.Abnormal and excessive ECM deposition not only is a phenotype of fibrosis but also is associated with cell-survival signaling mediated by integrin receptors during tumor invasion and tissue remodeling. Therefore, altered molecular expression in fibrosis may provide a clue to how myofibroblasts acquire an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling. Previously, we observed aberrant laminin-332 upregulation in the fibrosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) compared with autologous tumor burden and distal normal tissue, whereas such laminin-332 upregulation was not found in the noninvasive counterpart, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Contrary to our finding, laminin-332 expression was previously reported to be downregulated in breast cancer. Laminin-332, a large multidomain molecule involved in cell adhesion and matrix assembly, plays an important role in cell migration and survival by activating many signal mediators through binding to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 or \u03b16\u03b24. The role of laminin-332 in cell survival or anoikis resistance has been studied mostly in epithelial tumor cells, although some data exist on laminin-332-dependent survival of keratinocytes during wound healing. One group demonstrated that the matricellular protein thrombospondin1 (TSP1) induces anoikis resistance in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro . This work provided convincing evidence that an ECM protein can induce anoikis resistance in fibroblasts and suggested that laminin-332 may fulfill a similar function. However, because the fibroblasts used in previous studies were not derived from tumor stroma, the role of anoikis resistance of myofibroblasts in the context of tumor invasion remains undetermined.In this study, we hypothesized that invasive breast cancer cells induce laminin-332 upregulation in myofibroblasts undergoing tissue remodeling, which leads to anoikis resistance through laminin-332 autocrine signaling. To test our hypothesis, we used three types of fibroblasts isolated from IDC tissue and co-cultured them with breast cancer cells to investigate tumor-stroma crosstalk. Our results provide evidence that anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts develop during tissue remodeling of invasive breast cancer as a result of abnormal upregulation of ECM proteins and/or their receptors.Materials and methodsIsolation of primary fibroblastsHuman breast tumors and autologous normal breast tissues were obtained from three IDC patients undergoing surgery at Severance Hospital of the Yonsei University Health System, Korea. The protocol for the study was approved by Severance Hospital Ethics Committee (4-2008-0380). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. Based on the zonal concept proposed in our previous study, primary fibroblasts were isolated from tissue in the tumor zone (TZ, tumor burden), interface zone (IF, fibrosis), and normal zone (distal normal tissue), as described previously.Direct and indirect co-cultureFor direct co-culture, primary fibroblasts were cultured with MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Korean Cell Line Bank, Seoul, Korea), as described previously. MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells were selected as representative invasive and noninvasive types of breast cancer, respectively. Adherent fibroblasts were stained with 5 \u03bcM Cell Tracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 45 minutes. The dye solution was then replaced with fresh prewarmed medium, and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 2 hours. After washing them twice with PBS, unstained cancer cells were plated onto a layer of CMFDA-stained fibroblasts. The co-cultures were incubated in reduced serum media (RSM) composed of DMEM/F12, 1% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin for 1 week. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts and unstained breast cancer cells were sorted with flow cytometry and used for subsequent experiments. For indirect co-culture, conditioned medium (CM) was prepared by culturing MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at 80% confluency in RSM for 1 day. The CM was filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and diluted 1:1 with fresh RSM before addition to fibroblast cultures, which were incubated for a further 3 days.Transfection of fibroblasts with integrin \u03b24For transient transfection with integrin \u03b24, fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated on a six-well plate and transfected with 3 \u03bcg pRK6 b4 plasmid DNA (Addgene plasmid 16037; Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA; kindly donated by Dr. FG Giancotti, Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA), and 3 \u03bcl MATRA (Promokine, Heidelberg, Germany) in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl Opti-MEM on a Universal Magnet Plate (Promokine) for 15 minutes. Controls were transfected with 3 \u03bcg pRK5.Anoikis assaysFibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 1 ml) were added to either poly-HEMA- or serum-coated wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 with RSM, MCF-7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 6, 24, 48, or 72 hour. Maintenance of suspended fibroblasts in poly-HEMA-coated wells (anoikis conditions) was monitored by phase microscopy. Cell viability was measured by addition of 100 \u00b5l CCK-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) to each well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours, fluorescence was measured with a plate reader (excitation, 530 nm/emission, 580 nm). Fibroblasts from three IDC patients were assayed in triplicate in at least three separate experiments. For function-blocking assays, antibodies against integrin \u03b21, \u03b24, or laminin-332 (Millipore) were added to InF cells (which have high expression of laminin-332) with MDA-MB-231 CM and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hours. CAF cells (which express low levels of laminin-332) were treated with purified laminin-332 (Abcam, Cambridge, England) in RSM for 24 hours.Caspase-3 activity assayCaspase-3 activity in fibroblast lysates was measured by using a caspase-3 activity kit (Becton-Dickinson-Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA). Fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells) were plated in poly-HEMA-coated-wells with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM and treated with blocking antibodies or purified laminin-332 for 24 hours. Fibroblast lysates were incubated in a 96-well plate in HEPES buffer with 5 \u00b5l caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in the dark. Fluorescence was measured with a plate reader (excitation, 360 nm/emission, 460 nm).Rac1 pull-down assaySuspended fibroblasts were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 1\u00d7 lysis buffer. Rac/cdc42 assay reagent (10 \u00b5l; 10 \u00b5g) was added to 0.5 ml cell lysate, and the reaction mixture was incubated by rocking gently at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. Agarose beads were collected by pulsing for 5 seconds in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pelleted beads were washed 3 times with 0.5 ml Mg2+ Lysis/Wash Buffer (MLB), resuspended in 40 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 Laemmli reducing sample buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then detected with immunoblot.ImmunoblottingSuspended cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed in 100 \u03bcl Protein Extraction Solution (Intron Biotech, Seongnan-si, Korea), homogenized with a 30-gauge needle, incubated for 30minutes at 4\u00b0C, and then purified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. After quantifying proteins in the extracts by using the Bradford method, 20 \u03bcg protein was electrophoresed on 10% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore), and probed with primary antibodies against laminin \u03b32, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b16, integrin \u03b21, integrin \u03b24, Akt, phospho(Ser473)-Akt, E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or Rac1 (Millipore). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).StatisticsStatistical significance (indicated by asterisks) was determined by using the t test and ANOVA. Results were considered to be significant at P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS version 11.5 for Windows statistical software (SPSS Inc.).ResultsInvasive breast cancer cells induce upregulation of laminin-332 expression in stromal fibroblastsBased on the zonal concept that we previously introduced, stromal fibroblasts were isolated from each zone of IDC tissue after confirming expression of laminin-\u03b32, a subunit used to identify laminin-332. Primary fibroblasts from the tumor zone (TZ), interface zone (IZ), and normal zone were designated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), interface fibroblasts (InFs), and normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs), respectively. In morphology, InFs were slightly longer than CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A). After culture, InFs expressed a higher level of laminin-\u03b32 than did CAFs and NBFs, as they do in situ, and InFs and CAFs expressed a higher level of \u03b1-SMA did than NBFs (Figure 1B). To test whether factors secreted by invasive breast cancer cells can further increase fibroblast laminin-\u03b32 expression, we treated cultured fibroblasts with MDA-MB-231 CM. MDA-MB-231 CM dramatically increased laminin-\u03b32 expression in InFs compared with CAFs and NBFs. Thus, although MDA-MB-231 CM enhanced laminin-\u03b32 expression in all fibroblasts, the degree of increase depended on the intrinsic capacity of the cells to express laminin-\u03b32. In contrast, MCF7 CM suppressed laminin-\u03b32 expression (Figure 1C). Because the IZ is densely fibrotic, a hallmark of the tissue remodeling that leads to anoikis of stromal cells, the capacity of InFs to express laminin-332 under anoikis conditions was evaluated in the absence or presence of MDA-MB-231 CM stimulation. In InFs stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM, overexpression of laminin-\u03b32 was evident at 24 hours and was maintained for 72 hours (Figure 1D). Because transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 is a major component of MDA-MB-231 CM, we speculated that it might be responsible for inducing laminin-332 overexpression. To test this, we treated InFs with 100 nM LY2157299, a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, and MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours and found that laminin-\u03b32 expression was suppressed in the LY2157299-treated InFs (see Additional file 1, Figure S1).Laminin-332 expression in stromal fibroblasts is upregulated by invasive breast cancer cells. (A) Isolation of stromal fibroblasts from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Based on the zonal concept introduced in our previous study, fibroblasts were isolated from early-stage IDC tissue (less than 10 mm diameter) by enzyme digestion after confirmation of laminin-\u03b32 expression. (B) Expression of laminin-\u03b32 and \u03b1-SMA in fibroblasts of IDC. (C) Stimulation of laminin-\u03b32 expression in fibroblasts by CM from cancer cells. Fibroblasts were incubated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours. (D) Duration of laminin-\u03b32 expression in interface fibroblasts (InFs) under anoikis conditions. InFs (5 \u00d7 105 cell/well) were seeded onto poly-HEMA coated six-well plates with RSM or MDA-MB-231 CM for 72 hours. Suspended cells were collected at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours, as indicated.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in fibroblasts is induced through direct contact with invasive breast cancer cellsTwo integrin receptors for laminin-332, integrins \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24, are associated with signaling pathways for cell survival. A high level of integrins \u03b13 and \u03b16 expression was found in the fibroblasts derived from IDC (see Additional file 1 Figure S2). Integrin \u03b21 was also highly expressed in the fibroblasts, whereas integrin \u03b24 was not expressed (Figure 2A). It is widely known that the repertoire or pattern of integrin expression in stromal cells can be changed through communication with tumor cells. Because the IZ is adjacent to the TZ within tissue, CAFs and InFs can directly or indirectly communicate with tumor cells, and, as a result, the pattern of integrin expression in myofibroblasts may be altered. To test the effect of indirect communication with tumor cells, the fibroblasts were stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM or MCF7 CM. Integrin \u03b21 expression was not significantly affected, but remained high, independent of CM stimulation (see Additional file 1, Figure S3A). Integrin \u03b24 expression was also unchanged and remained undetectable (see Additional file 1, Figure S3B). For direct communication with tumor cells, fibroblasts were co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells. Integrin \u03b21 expression was not affected by direct contact with cancer cells, but was highly sustained (Figure 2B). In contrast, de novo expression of integrin \u03b24 was induced by direct contact with MDA-MB-231, but not MCF7, cells (Figure 2C). Neoexpression of integrin \u03b24 protein was also detected in fibroblasts after sorting from the co-culture.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression is induced in fibroblasts through direct contact with invasive breast cancer cells. (A) Endogenous expression of integrin \u03b21 and \u03b24 in fibroblasts of IDC. Fibroblasts were prestained with CMFDA and cultured in RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 72 hours before staining with PE-conjugated anti-integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 antibodies. (B) Integrin \u03b21 expression and (C) Integrin \u03b24 expression in fibroblasts cocultured with MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells. Confluent fibroblasts on 100-mm dishes were stained with 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 105) were added to the stained fibroblasts and cocultured for 1 week. Mixed cells were collected and stained with PE-conjugated anti-integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 antibodies. Integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 expression in cocultured fibroblasts was confirmed by immunoblot analysis after sorting.Anoikis resistance of fibroblasts is conferred by binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and by neoexpression of integrin \u03b24We found that MDA-MB-231 cells induced laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in fibroblasts, and that the fibroblasts expressed a high level of integrin \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b21 independent of their interaction with cancer cells (Figure 2, and see Additional file 1, Figure S2). Therefore, we hypothesized that the fibroblasts in IDC overcome anoikis through laminin-332-dependent survival pathways that are mediated by integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and/or \u03b16\u03b24. For the anoikis assay, laminin-332 upregulation in fibroblasts was induced by treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM, and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression was induced by transfection with an integrin \u03b24 plasmid. Integrin \u03b24 overexpression was confirmed in all transfected fibroblasts (see Additional file 1, Figure S4). Anoikis resistance of fibroblasts was examined by measuring their viability under anoikis conditions. In the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the viability of InFs (which express high levels of laminin-332) was increased by MDA-MB-231 CM but decreased by MCF7 CM, compared with the control incubated with reduced serum media (RSM) only. In the presence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the viability of InFs was dramatically increased at 6 hours and maintained at a level approximately twofold higher than that without integrin \u03b24 through 72 hours. In addition, the viability of these cells was further enhanced by treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 3A). Similar to that of InFs, the viability of CAFs (which express low levels of laminin-332) was increased by MDA-MB-231 CM and integrin \u03b24 induction, although the viability of CAFs was lower than that of InFs (Figure 3B). The viability of NBFs (expressing medium levels of laminin-322) showed a pattern similar to those of InFs and CAFs (Figure 3C). The viability of the three types of fibroblasts at 72 hours is directly compared in Figure 3D. Induction of integrin \u03b24 enhanced the viability of all fibroblast types approximately twofold compared with fibroblasts lacking integrin \u03b24. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 CM only increased the viability of InFs, and to a lesser extent than did integrin \u03b24 induction.The anoikis resistance of fibroblasts is mediated by binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and/or integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Viability of wild-type and integrin \u03b24-expressing (A) InFs, (B) CAFs, and (C) NBFs in the absence or presence of stimulation from cancer cells under anoikis conditions. The figures show fibroblast viability in RSM (open square), MCF7 CM (open diamond), and MDA-MB-231 CM (open circle) in the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, and viability in RSM (black square), MCF7 CM (black diamond), and MDA-MB-231 CM (black circle) in the presence of integrin \u03b24 expression. (D) Direct comparison of fibroblast viabilities. The viability of wild-type and integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts was compared at 72 hours. Black bar, CAFs; gray bar, InFs; white bar, NBFs; gray box, integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts. (E) Inhibition of the interaction between laminin-332 and integrin. InF and InF/\u03b24 cells were treated with isotype (black bar) and blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 (dark gray bar), \u03b24 (light gray bar), and laminin-332 (white bar) for 24 hours under anoikis conditions. (F) Increased viability of CAFs in response to treatment with laminin-332. CAF and CAF/\u03b24 cells were treated with purified laminin-332 (diluted to 10 \u03bcM with RSM) in poly-HEMA-treated 96-well plates for 24 hours. Black bar, untreated CAFs; white bar, laminin-322-treated CAFs. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.03 versus RSM in poly-HEMA-coated wells. Results are averages of three separate experiments.To confirm that fibroblast viability was associated with binding of laminin-332 to integrins \u03b13\u03b21 and/or \u03b16\u03b24, InFs and InFs/\u03b24 (expressing integrin \u03b24) were first stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM to induce laminin-332 upregulation and then treated with blocking antibodies against laminin-332, integrin \u03b21, or integrin \u03b24. The viability of both InF and InFs/\u03b24 was inhibited by blocking integrin \u03b21 and laminin-332, whereas blocking integrin \u03b24 had little effect (Figure 3E).To show that the viability of fibroblasts depends on laminin-332 expression, CAFs (Ln-332-low) were treated with 10 \u03bcM purified laminin-332, resulting in increased viability. The viability of CAFs/\u03b24 was strongly maintained, independent of laminin-332 treatment (Figure 3F).Laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppress caspase-3 activity in fibroblastsAnoikis is a form of caspase-dependent apoptosis that is caused by loss of integrin binding. Because caspase-3 is a key effector in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, we examined caspase-3 activity in fibroblasts in the absence or presence of cancer cell CM for 72 hours. Without integrin \u03b24 expression, InFs had lower caspase-3 activity than did CAFs and NBFs, and MDA-MB-231 CM further reduced caspase-3 activity, whereas MCF7 CM had no effect. In addition, the induction of integrin \u03b24 dramatically reduced caspase-3 activity, which also became much less dependent on MDA-MB-231 CM stimulation. The lowest measured caspase-3 activity was in InFs/\u03b24 cells stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 4A). To confirm whether the caspase-3 activity of fibroblasts is regulated by the binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 or \u03b16\u03b24, InFs and InFs/\u03b24 cells were treated with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21, \u03b24, or laminin-332, and their caspase-3 activity was compared. Inhibition of integrin \u03b21 significantly inhibited caspase-3 activity in InFs and InFs/\u03b24, whereas inhibition of integrin \u03b24 and laminin-332 had no effect.Laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppressed caspase-3 activity in fibroblasts. (A) Caspase-3 activity of fibroblasts under anoikis conditions in the absence or presence of integrin \u03b24 and/or stimulation with CM from cancer cells.

(B) Caspase-3 activity according to inhibition of integrin \u03b21 (dark-gray bar), \u03b24 (light-gray bar), or laminin-332 (white bar). The black bar shows the isotype control. (C) Effect of laminim-322 treatment on caspase-3 activity in CAFs. Black bar, untreated CAFs; white bar, laminin-322-treated CAFs. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.03 versus RSM in poly-HEMA-coated wells. Results are averages of three separate experiments.Similar to these results, induction of integrin \u03b24 also reduced caspase-3 activity (Figure 4B). To show further that the caspase-3 activity of fibroblasts was decreased by laminin-332 upregulation, CAFs (Ln-332-low) and CAFs/\u03b24 were treated with 10 \u03bcM purified laminin-332, and the resulting caspase-3 activities were measured. Treatment with laminin-332 significantly decreased caspase-3 activity in both CAFs and CAFs/\u03b24 (Figure 4C).Enhancement of anoikis resistance by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression is mediated by Rac1 activationAkt phosphorylation and Rac1 activation are associated with integrin-mediated anoikis resistance. In the absence of stimulation from cancer cells, InFs showed a higher level of phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) than did CAFs and NBFs. Akt phosphorylation was enhanced by MDA-MB-231 CM and decreased by MCF7 CM (Figure 5A). GTP-bound Rac1 was downregulated in InFs but upregulated in CAFs and NBFs, and MCF7 CM further increased GTP-bound Rac1 in InFs (Figure 5A). Induction of integrin \u03b24 expression dramatically increased GTP-bound Rac1, independent of stimulation from cancer cells, but did not have a significant effect on Akt phosphorylation (Figure 5B).Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression induces Rac1 activation. Akt phosphorylation and Rac1 activation is shown in (A) wild-type and (B) integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts. Wild-type and integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts were incubated in RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM under anoikis conditions for 24 hours. Suspended fibroblasts were harvested for Rac1 pull-down assays.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses aggregation of fibroblasts under anoikis conditionsSynoikis, the formation of cell aggregates in nonadherent conditions, has been proposed as a mechanism by which cells overcome anoikis. Therefore, we investigated the role of synoikis in the anoikis resistance of fibroblasts and whether it is affected by laminin-332 upregulation or integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. In the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the fibroblasts aggregated and formed big clusters under anoikis conditions; this aggregation was not affected by the upregulation of laminin-332 by MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 6A). In contrast, integrin \u03b24 expression suppressed fibroblast aggregation independent of laminin-332 (Figure 6B). To confirm whether fibroblast aggregation is caused by integrin \u03b24 expression, rather than binding of laminin-332 to integrins, we treated fibroblasts with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24. Neither blocking antibody affected fibroblast aggregation (Figure 6C). Based on these findings, we suggest that integrin \u03b24 suppresses fibroblast aggregation in anoikis conditions. Synoikis is known to depend on E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion; therefore, the suppressive effect of integrin \u03b24 expression on fibroblast aggregation may be caused by a decrease in E-cadherin expression. However, the fibroblasts expressing integrin \u03b24 did not show decreased E-cadherin expression compared with wild-type controls. Because \u03b2-catenin displays E-cadherin on the cell surface, we postulated that downregulation of \u03b2-catenin may be the cause of defective E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interaction. Consistent with this notion, \u03b2-catenin expression was decreased in fibroblasts expressing integrin \u03b24 (Figure 6D).Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions. Formation of fibroblast aggregates under anoikis conditions in (A) the absence or (B) the presence of integrin \u03b24. Fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105) were plated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM on poly-HEMA-coated six-well plates and incubated for 24 hours. The formation of cell aggregates was observed with phase microscopy. (C) The scattering of integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts under anoikis conditions was not affected by blocking the laminin-332/integrin interaction. Fibroblasts (2.5 \u00d7 104) were plated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM on poly-HEMA-coated 96-well plates with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 (diluted 1:100 with RSM) or MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours. (D) Decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin may cause reduced fibroblast aggregation. Suspended cells were collected, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis of \u03b2-catenin expression.DiscussionIn the present work, we hypothesized that myofibroblasts gain an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling through laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression induced by interaction with invasive breast cancer cells. To prove our hypothesis, we isolated three types of fibroblasts, CAFs from the tumor zone (the epicenter of tumor burden), InFs from the interface zone (fibrosis), and NBFs from the normal zone (distal normal tissue) of IDC, and co-cultured them with tumor cells to investigate the tumor-stroma interaction. InFs, the myofibroblasts undergoing tissue remodeling, showed a higher resistance to anoikis than did CAFs and NBFs as a result of their high endogenous expression level of laminin-332 and its dramatic upregulation by conditioned medium from invasive MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. In addition, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression was induced in fibroblasts by cell-to-cell contact with MDA-MB-231 cells regardless of the type of fibroblast, and expression of integrin \u03b24 increased anoikis resistance to a level approximately twofold higher than that induced by laminin-332 upregulation. From these results, we conclude that invasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling by inducing laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression, and that InFs may be the primary myofibroblasts involved in tissue remodeling during invasion of breast cancer cells.This may be the first study to describe how myofibroblasts acquire an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling by using a model of invasive breast cancer. Previously, one group reported that transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) confers an anoikis-resistant phenotype on normal primary human fetal lung fibroblasts, and another group showed that the matricellular protein TSP1 induces anoikis resistance in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, the fibroblasts used in these studies were not derived from tumor stroma, and we believed that it was necessary to investigate the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts in the context of tumor progression. Therefore, in this study, we used IDC to examine the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling.We chose to study IDC for two reasons: the first was the dense fibrosis around the tumor burden, which is a phenotype of vigorous tissue remodeling, and the second was aberrant upregulation of laminin-332 in the fibrosis (in contrast, laminin-332 upregulation was not detected in its counterpart, DCIS). Because laminin-332 is widely known to promote cell survival, the anoikis resistance of myofibroblasts is likely mediated by laminin-332-dependent signaling. To test this assumption, we first investigated laminin-322 expression in CAFs, InFs, and NBFs and found that the expression pattern in the fibroblasts was the same as that in situ (Figure 1A). Based on \u03b1-SMA expression and their location in the tissue, CAFs and InFs are presumed to be the myofibroblasts that interact with invasive tumor cells during tissue remodeling.Within the interface zone (IZ) adjacent to the tumor zone (TZ), invasive breast cancer cells may interact with InFs via cell-to-cell contact at the border between the TZ and IZ or with diffusible factors away from the border and within the IZ. It is therefore possible that the expression of laminin-332 or its receptors, integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24, is affected differently according to the type of interaction. To test this notion, fibroblasts were co-cultured with tumor cells to simulate cell-to-cell contact or were stimulated with the CM from tumor cells to test the role of diffusible factors. In our previous study, laminin-332 upregulation in the IZ was shown to be associated with tumor invasiveness. Thus, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were used as invasive and noninvasive breast cancer cell types, respectively. After treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM, but not MCF7 CM, laminin-\u03b32, a subunit used to identify laminin-332, was upregulated in InFs, and this upregulation was maintained under anoikis conditions. Expression of laminin-\u03b32 in CAFs and NBFs was also promoted by MDA-MB-231 CM, but to a lesser extent than in InFs (Figure 1C). The degree of laminin-\u03b32 induction by diffusible factors produced by MDA-MB-231 seemed to depend on the endogenous capacity of fibroblasts to express laminin-\u03b32. According to previous reports, TGF-\u03b2 is a major soluble factor produced by MDA-MB-231. Therefore, we examined whether laminin-\u03b32 upregulation by MDA-MB-231 CM is induced by TGF-\u03b2 and found that the TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor LY2157299 effectively suppressed laminin-\u03b32 expression (see Additional file 1, Figure S1). Based on this result, we suggest that expression of laminin-322 is at least partially induced by TGF-\u03b2 secreted by invasive breast cancer cells. However, further evaluation is required because we did not test other cytokines that are highly secreted from invasive breast cancer cells. In contrast to laminin-332 upregulation by MDA-MB-231 CM, integrins \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b21 were highly expressed in fibroblasts and not affected by either diffusible factors or direct contact with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2, and see Additional file 1, Figure S3). Integrin \u03b24 was not endogenously expressed in fibroblasts, but its expression was newly induced by direct contact with MDA-MB-231 cells. Almost no difference was found in the induction of anoikis resistance by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in the different types of fibroblasts.When in direct contact with invasive breast cancer cells, the anoikis resistance of InFs involved both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and integrin \u03b16\u03b24 as a result of integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Although both integrins are known receptors for laminin-332, their signaling pathways, signal duration, and dependency on laminin-332 are different. In the case of integrin \u03b13\u03b21, signaling was dependent on laminin-332 binding and mediated by Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation (Figure 5A). In contrast, integrin \u03b16\u03b24-mediated signaling was independent of laminin-332 and mediated through Rac1 activation (Figure 5B). Anoikis resistance induced by integrin \u03b16\u03b24 was approximately twofold higher than that induced by integrin \u03b13\u03b21 (Figure 3D). This is supported by a report that Rac1 activation through integrin \u03b16\u03b24 produces a long-lasting survival signal. Furthermore, the long cytoplasmic tail of integrin \u03b24 can be phosphorylated by other factors such as c-Met, independent of laminin-332. In addition to anoikis resistance, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppressed fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions, possibly as a result of downregulation of \u03b2-catenin (Figure 6D). Many cells overcome anoikis through synoikis, the formation of cell clusters via E-cadherin-mediated interaction between cells. The expression of E-cadherin on the cell surface is known to be regulated by \u03b2-catenin; therefore, decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression may cause defective surface expression of E-cadherin, which in turn suppresses fibroblast aggregation. Considering a recent report that myofibroblasts in the primary tumor site metastasize to the lung along with tumor cells, in the context of tumor metastasis, single cells or a small aggregate of myofibroblasts may be more likely to undergo distant migration with invasive tumor cells than might a large cluster.In summary, two mechanisms seem to exist by which myofibroblasts acquire anoikis resistance through laminin-integrin signaling during tissue remodeling as a result of either direct or indirect interaction between invasive breast cancer cells and myofibroblasts in the fibrosis (or interface zone) (Figure 7). For indirect interaction, factor(s) secreted from invasive tumor cells stimulate myofibroblasts to overexpress laminin-332. Laminin-332 binds to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 on myofibroblasts and turns on an autocrine cell survival signal mediated by Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. In addition, myofibroblasts that lose their attachment spontaneously use synoikis to overcome anoikis.Two possible mechanisms by which myofibroblasts acquire anoikis resistance via integrin receptors for laminin-332 during tissue remodeling. Direct and indirect interactions may occur between invasive tumor cells and myofibroblasts in the interface zone of invasive ductal carcinoma. Myofibroblasts within the interface zone could be stimulated to express laminin-332 by diffusible factors from invasive breast cancer cells. Binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 on the myofibroblasts turns on a cell-survival signaling pathway mediated by Akt phosphorylation. In this case, myofibroblasts may simultaneously use synoikis to overcome anoikis. In addition, in the border between the tumor zone and the interface zone, invasive breast cancer cells can directly interact with myofibroblasts, leading to integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Once integrin \u03b24 is induced, myofibroblasts use both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24 as receptors for laminin-332, and become resistant to anoikis via Akt phosphorylation (laminin-332 dependent) and Rac1 activation (laminin-332 independent). Moreover, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression may inhibit myofibroblast aggregation through downregulation of \u03b2-catenin.Second, direct contact between invasive breast cancer cells and myofibroblasts induces integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in the fibroblasts. Consequently, myofibroblasts express both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and integrin \u03b16\u03b24 as receptors for laminin-332. In this case, cell-survival signals are mediated by Rac1 activation and Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation requires binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21, whereas Rac1 activation by integrin \u03b16\u03b24 is not dependent on laminin-332. Furthermore, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions, possibly through downregulation of \u03b2-catenin.ConclusionsInvasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling by inducing laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Our findings indicate that interface fibroblasts may be the primary myofibroblasts involved in tissue remodeling during breast cancer invasion.AbbreviationsCAF: cancer-associated fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the TZ); CMFDA: (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate); DCIS: ductal carcinoma in situ; ECM: extracellular matrix; IDC: invasive ductal carcinoma; InF: interface fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the IZ); IZ: interface zone (tumor-free fibrotic zone adjacent to tumor burden); Ln-332: laminin-332; NBF: normal breast fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the NZ); NZ: normal zone (normal tissue neighboring the IZ); Poly-HEMA: poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); TZ: tumor zone (tumor burden of IDC).Competing interestsWe declare no conflicts of interest in all participants.Authors' contributionsBGK developed the concept and design of the study, performed the experiments, analyzed and organized the data, and wrote the manuscript.

In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

Furthermore, this study establishes chemotherapeutic targeting of FAK as an effective, two-pronged approach in preventing tumor progression both by decreasing innate immune cell infiltration, and by inhibiting early TGF-\u03b2-dependent metastasis.IntroductionInvasion and metastasis are the most lethal characteristics of breast cancer. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 is a powerful suppressor of mammary tumorigenesis through its ability to repress mammary epithelial cell (MEC) proliferation, as well as through its creation of cellular microenvironments that inhibit MEC motility, invasion, and metastasis. During breast cancer progression, the tumor-suppressing function of TGF-\u03b2 is frequently subverted, thus transforming TGF-\u03b2 from a suppressor of breast cancer formation to a promoter of its growth and metastasis. Indeed, how TGF-\u03b2 both suppresses and promotes tumorigenesis remains an unknown and fundamental question that directly affects the ability of science and medicine to target effectively the TGF-\u03b2 signaling system during the treatment of human malignancies. Deciphering this paradox remains the most important question concerning the biologic and pathologic actions of this multifunctional cytokine.FAK is a ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) whose amino acid sequence is about 90% homologous between humans, chickens, mice, and frogs. An essential function for FAK during mammalian development is evident in the lethality of FAK-deficient embryos at E8.5, presumably due to an indispensable role of FAK in regulating cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Along these lines, aberrant FAK expression or activity also supports carcinoma cell metastasis by enhancing these same cellular processes in cancer cells, and possibly in cancer stem cells, to support tumor angiogenesis. Although it remains to be determined whether altered expression or subcellular localization of FAK possesses true prognostic value to cancer patients, recent studies do provide strong evidence associating increased FAK expression with the development and progression of mammary carcinomas. To this end, small-molecule inhibitors of FAK have recently been developed and show potent efficacy to inhibit FAK PTK activity specifically, as well as to decrease the growth of subcutaneous tumor xenografts. Despite these recent advances, the oncogenic signaling modules targeted by aberrant FAK expression and activity in developing and progressing breast cancers, and their potential role in regulating the activity and composition of associated tumor stroma remain to be fully defined.We recently identified a critical \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II:Src:Grb2 signaling axis that mediates TGF-\u03b2 stimulation of MAP kinases in normal and malignant MECs, leading to their acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasive, and metastatic phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Activation of this oncogenic signaling axis by TGF-\u03b2 requires \u03b23 integrin to form complexes with T\u03b2R-II; however, whether the \u03b23 integrin/T\u03b2R-II interaction is direct or mediated via an accessory protein remains unknown. The present study addresses this important question, as well as establishes the therapeutic effectiveness of inhibiting FAK PTK activity in a TGF-\u03b2-driven model of breast cancer metastasis.Materials and methodsCell lines and reagentsNormal murine NMuMG and metastatic 4T1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured as described previously. 4T1 cells were engineered to express stably firefly luciferase by their transfection with pNifty-CMV-luciferase and selection with Zeocin (500 \u03bcg/ml; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). NMuMG cells expressing WT or the nonfunctional mutant D119A-\u03b23 integrin were constructed by retroviral transduction, as described previously. The MCF10A cell derivates T1k, Ca1h, and Ca1a were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum. The construction of NMuMG and 4T1 cells lacking FAK was accomplished by their lentiviral-mediated transduction with a scrambled (i.e., nonsilencing shRNA) or verified FAK-specific shRNA sequence encoded in pLentilox3.7-puro. In brief, human 293T cells were transiently transfected with lentiviral packaging vectors (i.e., pMD2.G, pRRE, pRSV, and pLentiLox 3.7) according to standard protocols, and 48 h after transfection, the resulting conditioned medium was collected, filtered, and mixed with polybrene (8 \u03bcg/ml). Target cells were incubated in viral-containing supernatants for 48 h, and cells expressing nonsilencing or FAK-specific shRNAs were isolated by puromycin selection (5 \u03bcg/ml) for 14 days. Afterward, puromycin-resistant NMuMG and 4T1 cells were assayed for FAK-deficiency by immunoblotting with anti-FAK antibodies, as described later.Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation assaysFor FAK immunoblots, \u03b23 integrin-expressing NMuMG cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and maintained in a nonadherent state for 4 h in serum-reduced media (0.5%). Afterward, the cells either were immediately harvested or were replated in the absence or presence of TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for an additional 4 h, at which point they were harvested to detect differences in FAK phosphorylation and expression by immunoblotting (see later). Whole-cell extracts prepared from normal and malignant MECs were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against T\u03b2R-II, Grb2, and \u03b23 integrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and the resulting immunocomplexes were immunoblotted various antibodies listed later. Where specified, 4T1 cells were incubated for 18 h in the absence or presence of the FAK inhibitors, PF-562271 or PF-573228 (Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY) at the indicated concentrations before immunoprecipitation of \u03b23 integrin. NMuMG cells also were incubated in serum-reduced media (0.5% FBS) supplemented with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for 18 h in the absence or presence of the Src inhibitor, PP2 (10 \u03bcg/ml; Calbiochem, Temecula, CA). For all cell-signaling experiments, 4T1 or NMuMG cells were serum starved (0 FBS) or deprived (0.5% FBS), respectively, for 6 h before TGF-\u03b21 stimulation (5 ng/ml). Control and FAK-deficient 4T1 cells were incubated for up to 48 hours with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) and detergent-solubilized whole-cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted for E-cadherin (E-Cad; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Last, 4T1 cells were incubated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for 24 h in serum-free medium, and the resulting conditioned medium was precipitated with 0.01% sodium deoxycholate/6.25% trichloracetic acid and immunoblotted for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Cell extracts were prepared by harvesting NMuMG and 4T1 cells on ice in 3-D RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 6 mM sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium orthovanadate, 40 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 20 mM NaF), and subsequently were clarified by microcentrifugation before immunoblotting with the following primary antibodies (dilution): (a) anti-phospho-Y397-FAK (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); (b) anti-phospho-Y577-FAK (1:1000; Cell Signaling); (c) anti-phospho-Y925-FAK (1:1,000; Cell Signaling); (d) anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (1:500; Cell Signaling); (e) anti-phospho-Smad2 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling); (f) anti-phospho-Smad3 (1:500; Cell Signaling); (g) anti-E-cadherin (1:2,500 BD Biosciences); (h) anti-PAI-1 (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (i) anti-FAK (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (j) anti-\u03b2-actin (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (k) anti-p38 MAPK (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); (l) anti-Smad2/3 (1:1,000; Cell signaling); (m) anti-phospho-Y416-Src (1:1,000; Cell Signaling); and (n) anti-Src (1:1,000, Cell Signaling).Cell migration and invasion assaysConfluent NMuMG cell cultures were wounded with a micropipette tip (200 \u03bcl) and immediately placed in 1% serum-containing medium supplemented with or without TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) or the T\u03b2R-I inhibitor, SB-431542 (10 \u03bcM; Sigma). Bright-field images of wounded monolayers were obtained immediately after wounding (T0) and at various times thereafter as indicated. The extent of wound closure was quantified by obtaining three wound measurements for each of three random fields (x100) per wound, and all wound conditions were performed in triplicate. Measurements were taken by using the SlideBook Imaging Software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO). The ability of TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) to alter the invasion of 4T1 cells (50,000 cells/well) was analyzed by using a modified Boyden Chamber assay, as described previously.Luminescent reporter gene assaysAlterations in gene expression regulated by TGF-\u03b2 were assessed by using a reporter gene assay that monitored changes in luciferase expression driven by the synthetic SBE (Smad-binding element) promoter, as described previously. In brief, NMuMG cells (25,000 to 30,000 cells/well) were allowed to adhere overnight to 24-well plates. The following morning, the cells were transiently transfected by overnight exposure to LT1-liposomes (Mirus, Madison, WI) that contained 300 ng/well of pSBE-luciferase cDNA and 50 ng/well of CMV-\u03b2-gal cDNA, which was used to control for differences in transfection efficiency. Afterward, the cells were washed twice with PBS and stimulated overnight with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) in serum-deprived (0.5% FBS) media. Upon completion of agonist stimulation, firefly luciferase and \u03b2-gal activities present in detergent-solubilized cell extracts were determined. In addition, 4T1-luciferase cells that stably expressed firefly luciferase under control of the CMV promoter were cultured into 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well and subsequently were transiently transfected with an SBE reporter plasmid that drove expression of renilla luciferase. The transfectants were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 as described previously, and subsequently were processed for the determination of renilla and firefly luciferase by using the Dual-Glo Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).Real-time PCR analysesNMuMG and 4T1 cells were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for 24 h, and total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Afterward, total RNA was reverse transcribed by using the iScript cDNA Synthesis System (BioRad, Hercules, CA), and semiquantitative real-time PCR was conducted by using iQ SYBR Green (BioRad) according to the manufacture's recommendations and as described previously. In all cases, differences in RNA concentration were controlled by normalizing individual gene signals to their corresponding GAPDH RNA signals. The oligonucleotide primer pairs used are provided in Additional data file 1.Immunofluorescent analysesNMuMG cells (25,000 cells/well) were allowed to adhere overnight to glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. Afterward, the cells were washed extensively in PBS and immediately stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) in serum-deprived (0.5% FBS) media for 18 h. Upon completion of agonist stimulation, the cells were (a) fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde; (b) permeablized in 0.1% Triton X-100; (c) stained with phospho-Y925 FAK antibodies according to the manufacture's instructions (Cell Signaling); and (d) visualized by using FITC-labeled donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The actin cytoskeleton was visualized by using TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (0.25 \u03bcM; Invitrogen) as described previously.Tumor growth, bioluminescent imaging, and immunohistochemical analysesControl or various 4T1 derivatives engineered to express firefly luciferase stably were resuspended in sterile PBS (50 \u03bcl) and injected orthotopically into the mammary fat-pads (0.5 to 1.0 \u00d7 104 cells/injection) of 6-week-old female Balb/C mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME). Primary tumor growth and metastasis development was assessed by using digital calipers (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and by weekly bioluminescent imaging on a Xenogen IVIS-200 (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). Tumor volumes were calculated by using the following equation:where \"x\" is the tumor width and \"y\" is the tumor length. Finally, serial histologic sections of control and FAK-deficient 4T1 tumors removed after the study were stained with phospho-specific antibodies against p38 MAPK and Smad2 and counterstained with hematoxylin, as previously described. Where indicated, mice were treated daily with PF-562271 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle (5% gelucire 44/14; Gattefosse, Saint Priest Cedex, France) by oral gavage. Histologic sections from these studies were stained with antibodies for the F4/80 macrophage marker (IHC Tech, Aurora, CO), or with phospho-specific antibodies against Y397-FAK, as described previously. All animal studies were performed in accordance with the animal protocol procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Colorado.Statistical analysisStatistical values were defined by using an unpaired Student's t-test; a P value <0.05 was considered significant. P values for all experiments analyzed are indicated.ResultsTGF-\u03b2-stimulated FAK activation and stabilization is dependent on Src and \u03b23 integrinNMuMG cells exhibit several distinct morphologic features in response to TGF-\u03b2, most notably a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Figure 1a shows that phosphorylated FAK localized primarily to the periphery in quiescent NMuMG cells, producing a staining pattern very similar to that of F-actin, which was visualized with phalloidin staining (Figure 1a). However, upon TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, phosphorylated FAK underwent a dramatic reorganization and localized primarily at the end of actin stress fibers (Figure 1a; overlay). Accordingly, immunoblotting NMuMG cell extracts with a panel of phospho-specific FAK antibodies showed that TGF-\u03b2 stimulation dramatically increased the phosphorylation of FAK (Figure 1b). Figure 1b also shows that TGF-\u03b2 stimulation increased FAK protein levels in NMuMG cells and induced an impressive upregulation of \u03b23 integrin. Both the increase in FAK phosphorylation and expression, as well as the increase in \u03b23 integrin expression were wholly dependent on Src activity, because treating these same cells with the Src inhibitor, PP2, abrogated FAK phosphorylation at the Src-dependent sites (Y577 and Y925) and prevented TGF-\u03b21-induced expression of FAK and \u03b23 integrin (Figure 1b). Furthermore, in contrast to control (i.e., GFP) and WT-\u03b23 integrin-expressing NMuMG cells, those engineered to express a signaling-deficient mutant of \u03b23 integrin, D119A-\u03b23, exhibited drastically reduced maintenance of FAK protein levels and phosphorylation in response to nonadherent conditions (Figure 1c). To more thoroughly investigate the role of \u03b23 integrin in TGF-\u03b2-mediated stabilization and phosphorylation of FAK, nonadherent NMuMG cells were replated in the absence or presence of TGF-\u03b21 before analyzing FAK expression and phosphorylation by immunoblotting. As shown in Figure 1d, treatment of control (i.e., GFP) and WT-\u03b23 integrin-expressing NMuMG cells with TGF-\u03b21 stimulated increased FAK phosphorylation (Figure 1d). In stark contrast, TGF-\u03b2 treatment of D119A-\u03b23 integrin-expressing NMuMG cells actually decreased their expression and phosphorylation of FAK (Figure 1d). Finally, we conducted real-time PCR for FAK in control (i.e., GFP), WT-\u03b23, D119A-\u03b23 integrin-expressing NMuMG cells. As shown in Figure 1e, chronic TGF-\u03b2 stimulation (i.e., 24 h) had no effect on FAK mRNA levels in control or WT-\u03b23 integrin-expressing NMuMG cells; however, these same experimental conditions did increase FAK mRNA expression in D119A-\u03b23 NMuMG cells. These data strongly suggest that (a) upregulated \u03b23 integrin expression is required to stabilize FAK protein levels upon TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, and (b) activated \u03b23 integrin signaling acts as a negative-feedback mechanism governing FAK transcription. Along these lines, our use of oligonucleotide sequences that specifically amplified murine \u03b23 integrin sequences, not that of recombinant human WT or D119A \u03b23 integrin sequences, showed that NMuMG cells engineered to overexpress WT-\u03b23 integrin failed to upregulate endogenous murine \u03b23 integrin transcripts in response to TGF-\u03b2 stimulation (Figure 1f). Thus, these findings provide the first evidence that the stability and extent of FAK phosphorylation induced by TGF-\u03b2 is critically dependent on its ability to upregulate functional \u03b23 integrin, and that both of these events require the activity of Src kinase. These data also suggest that FAK may play a critical function with \u03b23 integrin and Src in facilitating TGF-\u03b2 signaling and function in MECs.Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2-stimulated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation depends on Src and \u03b23 integrin. (a) Fluorescently labeled phalloidin (red) and phosphorylated Y925-FAK (green) staining in quiescent (NS) NMuMG cells showed normal cortical actin distribution that colocalized with phosphorylated FAK at cell-cell junctions and borders. Administering TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for 18 hours promoted F-actin stress fiber formation, and reorganized phosphorylated FAK. DAPI counterstaining, shown in blue (overlay). Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times. (b) Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts prepared from NMuMG cells stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 as in (a) showed that TGF-\u03b2 treatment induced the phosphorylation of FAK at positions Y397, Y577, and Y925. Total FAK protein levels also were increased. Administration of the Src inhibitor, PP2 (10 \u03bcg/ml) for the duration of the TGF-\u03b21 treatment (18 hours), prevented the phosphorylation of FAK at Y577 and Y925, but not at its autophosphorylation site, Y397. In addition, PP2 treatment prevented the induction of \u03b23 integrin expression in NMuMG cells stimulated with TGF-\u03b21. Differences in protein loading were monitored by reprobing stripped membranes with antibodies against \u03b2-actin. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times. (c) FAK phosphorylation and its overall expression was decreased in nonadherent NMuMG cells (4 hours) expressing mutant \u03b23 integrin (D119A), but not its wild-type counterpart (\u03b23-WT). Protein loading was monitored by reprobing stripped membranes with antibodies against \u03b2-actin. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times. (d) NMuMG cells were treated as in (c) and then replated for 4 hours in the absence or presence of TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) before analyzing FAK phosphorylation and expression. Protein loading was monitored by reprobing stripped membranes with antibodies against \u03b2-actin. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated twice with identical results. (e, f) Polyclonal populations of control (i.e., GFP), WT-\u03b23 integrin (\u03b23-WT)-, or D119A-\u03b23 integrin (\u03b23-D119A)-expressing NMuMG cells were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours, and total RNA was isolated and analyzed with semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to monitor FAK (e) and murine \u03b23 integrin (f) expression. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM; n = 3) relative FAK and \u03b23 integrin transcript levels measured in response to TGF-\u03b21, as compared with their unstimulated counterparts. (*P < 0.05).FAK is critically involved in TGF-\u03b2-induced p38 MAPK activation and mammary epithelial cell migrationTo assess the role of FAK in mediating downstream TGF-\u03b2 signaling events, we next used shRNAs to deplete stably the expression of FAK in NMuMG cells (Figure 2a). As shown in Figure 2a and 2b, FAK-deficiency had no effect on canonical Smad2/3 activity stimulated by TGF-\u03b2, but did markedly disrupt the coupling of TGF-\u03b2 to the noncanonical p38 MAPK pathway. Furthermore, the quiescent architecture of the actin cytoskeleton, as well as TGF-\u03b2-induced actin stress fibers were severely disrupted upon FAK depletion (Figure 2c). We also examined the impact of FAK deficiency on the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to stimulate MEC migration. To do so, confluent monolayers of control or FAK-deficient NMuMG cells were wounded with a micropipette tip, and the extent of MEC migration into the denuded area was measured at various times thereafter. Stimulating FAK-deficient NMuMG cells with TGF-\u03b21 enhanced their wound-healing response, although at a significantly reduced rate as compared with control (i.e., scrambled shRNA) NMuMG cells (Figure 2d), suggesting that FAK plays a critical role in TGF-\u03b2-induced MEC migration. Accordingly, administration of the T\u03b2R-I inhibitor, SB-431542, inhibited control NMuMG cell wound closure, thereby identifying a role for autocrine TGF-\u03b2 signaling in mediating the closure of MEC wounds. Interestingly, FAK-deficient NMuMG cells were refractory to administration of the T\u03b2R-I inhibitor (Figure 2d), suggesting that these cells have adapted a less-efficient mechanism of migration that is no longer dependent on the activities of TGF-\u03b2 and FAK. Finally, as wound closure is driven by both cell migration and proliferation, the decreased growth rate of FAK-deficient cells (see Additional data file 2a) may contribute to their reduced wound-healing response. However, this does not appear to be the case in NMuMG cells, as control and FAK-deficient cells exhibit similar cytostatic responses to high-dose TGF-\u03b21 treatment (5 ng/ml; see Additional data file 2b), which indicates that the difference in wound healing between control and FAK-deficient cells reflects alterations in their ability to migrate, not to proliferate (Figure 2d). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that FAK is directly involved in mediating TGF-\u03b2-induced MEC migration.Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is critically involved in normal mammary epithelial cell (MEC) migration and p38 MAPK signaling stimulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2. (a) Control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) NMuMG cells were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for varying times as indicated, at which point whole-cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with phospho-specific antibodies against Smad2 (p-smad2), Smad3 (p-smad3), or p38 MAPK (p-p38) as shown. Immunoblot analysis of total p38 MAPK, Smad2/3, FAK, and \u03b2-actin serves as loading controls. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times. (b) Control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) NMuMG cells were transiently transfected with pSBE-luciferase and pCMV-\u03b2-gal cDNAs, and subsequently were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for 18 hours. Afterward, luciferase and \u03b2-gal activities present in detergent-solubilized cell extracts were measured. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) ratios of luciferase:\u03b2-gal activity observed in three independent experiments completed in triplicate. (c) Fluorescently labeled phalloidin staining showed the formation of F-actin stress fibers in control (i.e., scram) NMuMG cells treated for 18 hours with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml). FAK-deficiency (shFAK) significantly impaired the ability of TGF-\u03b21 to induce stress fibers, as well as disrupted normal actin cytoskeletal architecture. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated twice. (d) Control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) NMuMG cell migration into denuded wounds over a 48-hour period in the absence (NS) or presence of either the T\u03b2R-I inhibitor, SB-431542 (10 \u03bcM, SB) or TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml). Data depict the mean (\u00b1 SEM) percentage of wound closure measured in five independent experiments. FAK deficiency inhibited tonic and TGF-\u03b21-stimulated NMuMG cell migration. In addition, tonic NMuMG cell migration was inhibited by SB-431542, indicating disruption of autocrine TGF-\u03b2 signaling in wounded cultures (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.005).FAK is required for oncogenic signaling by TGF-\u03b2Imbalances between canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling contribute to mammary tumorigenesis. We illustrated this shift in TGF-\u03b2 signaling by using the human MCF10A breast cancer progression model that consists of indolent (T1K), malignant nonmetastatic (Ca1h), and malignant metastatic (Ca1a) cells. With this model system, we observed an enhanced ability of TGF-\u03b2 to activate specifically p38 MAPK, but not Smad2, in a manner correlating with increasing metastatic potential (Figure 3a). Importantly, the improved coupling of TGF-\u03b2 to p38 MAPK activation in malignant metastatic Ca1a cells correlated with a marked upregulation of FAK expression as compared with their premetastatic counterparts (Figure 3a). These findings are consistent with the notion that the acquisition of metastasis by breast cancer cells coincides with their elevated expression of FAK, which enhances p38 MAPK activation by TGF-\u03b2 and its pro-metastatic activities.Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is essential in mediating oncogenic signaling by transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2. (a) Increased FAK expression correlates with TGF-\u03b21-mediated activation of p38 MAPK in metastatic human breast cancer cells. The human MCF10A mammary carcinoma progression system (T1k, well differentiated; Ca1h, premalignant; and Ca1a, metastatic) was stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml; tgf), or with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) in combination with epidermal growth factor (50 ng/ml; t/e) for 30 minutes and subsequently analyzed for phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (p-p38) or Smad2 (p-smad2), as indicated. Increased FAK expression was noted in metastatic Ca1a cells. Protein loading was monitored by reprobing stripped membranes with antibodies against total p38 MAPK (t-p38), total Smad2/3 (t-smad2/3), and \u03b2-actin. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated twice. (b) Control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) 4T1 cells were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for varying times, as indicated. Afterward, cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with phospho-specific antibodies against Smad2 (p-smad2), Smad3 (p-smad3), or p38 MAPK (p-P38), as shown. Reprobing stripped membranes with antibodies against total p38 MAPK (t-p38), total Smad2/3 (t-smad2/3) FAK, and \u03b2-actin served as loading controls. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times. (c) Control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) 4T1-luciferase cells were transfected with pSBE-renilla luciferase and stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) before measuring firefly and renilla luciferase activities. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) ratios of renilla:firefly luciferase activity observed in three independent experiments completed in triplicate. (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.0001). (d) Src phosphorylation (p-Src-Y416) was decreased in FAK-depleted (shFAK) 4T1 cells as compared with their control (i.e., scram) counterparts. Immunoblots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against Src (t-Src), FAK, and \u03b2-actin as loading controls. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times.To investigate the merits of this supposition, we compared the ability of control and FAK-deficient metastatic breast cancer cells to activate Smad2/3 and p38 MAPK in response to TGF-\u03b2. We found that FAK deficiency dramatically not only decreased basal p38 MAPK phosphorylation, but also completely abrogated the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to activate p38 MAPK (Figure 3b). Interestingly, in contrast to what we observed in NMuMG cells (Figure 2a and 2b), the coupling of TGF-\u03b2 to both Smad2 and Smad3 were also decreased in FAK-deficient 4T1 cells (Figures 3b and 3c). These data stress the increased dependence of metastatic breast cancer cells on FAK to facilitate not only noncanonical (p38 MAPK), but also canonical (Smad2/3) TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 3).Previously, we established Src as being essential for the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to stimulate p38 MAPK in MECs. To investigate the role of FAK in this mechanism, we now analyzed the phosphorylation and activation status of Src (i.e., phosphorylation at Y416) in control and FAK-depleted cells, which showed that FAK deficiency rendered Src hypophosphorylated in 4T1 cells (Figure 4d). Collectively, these findings are the first to demonstrate the increasing dependence of metastatic breast cancer cells on the reciprocal activation between FAK and Src in mediating downstream TGF-\u03b2 signaling.Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity coordinates the formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes. (a) \u03b23 integrin was immunoprecipitated (\u03b23 I.P.) from control (i.e., GFP) or \u03b23 integrin-expressing NMuMG cell extracts, and the resulting immunocomplexes were immunoblotted with antibodies against T\u03b2R-II and FAK, as indicated. Direct immunoblot analysis of an aliquot of the prepared cell extracts (Input) served to monitor the total levels of T\u03b2R-II, \u03b23 integrin, and \u03b2-actin. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times and show that FAK was present in \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes. (b) \u03b23 integrin (\u03b23 I.P.) or T\u03b2R-II (T\u03b2R-II I.P.) were immunoprecipitated from control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) NMuMG cell extracts before (pre-EMT) or after (post-EMT) their induction of EMT by TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml, 24 hours), and the resulting immunocomplexes were reciprocally immunoblotted for \u03b23 integrin or T\u03b2R-II. Direct immunoblot analysis of an aliquot of the prepared cell extracts (Input) served to monitor the total levels of T\u03b2R-II, \u03b23 integrin, FAK, and \u03b2-actin. (c) \u03b23 integrin was immunoprecipitated (\u03b23 I.P.) from control (scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) 4T1 cell extracts, and the resulting immunocomplexes were immunoblotted for T\u03b2R-II and FAK, as indicated. Direct immunoblot analysis of an aliquot of the prepared cell extracts (Input) served to monitor the total levels of FAK, T\u03b2R-II, and \u03b2-actin. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 4 times and show that FAK deficiency inhibits the formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes. (d) Grb2 was immunoprecipitated (Grb2 I.P.) from vector control (cntrl), T\u03b2R-II- (T\u03b2R-II), and FAK-deficient and T\u03b2R-II-expressing (T\u03b2R-II/shFAK) 4T1 cell extracts, and the resulting immunocomplexes were immunoblotted for T\u03b2R-II, FAK, and Grb2, as indicated. Direct immunoblot analysis of an aliquot of the prepared cell extracts (Input) served to monitor the total levels of T\u03b2R-II, FAK, and \u03b2-actin. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times and show that FAK deficiency inhibits the interaction between Grb2 and T\u03b2R-II. (e) \u03b23 integrin was immunoprecipitated (\u03b23 I.P.) from unstimulated (NS) cell extracts derived from 4T1 cells and cells incubated for 18 hours with the FAK inhibitors PF-562271 (271) or PF-573228 (228), as indicated. The resulting immunocomplexes were immunoblotted for T\u03b2R-II. Direct immunoblot analysis of an aliquot of the prepared cell extracts (Input) served to monitor the levels of FAK phosphorylated at Y397 (pFAK), total FAK (tFAK), T\u03b2R-II, and \u03b2-actin. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated 3 times and show that FAK PTK activity is required for the formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes.FAK expression and kinase activity are required for the aberrant formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II signaling complexesWe next sought to address the mechanism by which FAK facilitates oncogenic TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Previously, we observed \u03b23 integrin to interact aberrantly with T\u03b2R-II, resulting in the promotion of MAPK signaling by TGF-\u03b2. Indeed, robust quantities of FAK were detected in \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes specifically in NMuMG cells engineered to overexpress \u03b23 integrin (Figure 4a). Furthermore, the formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes was readily induced in NMuMG cells subsequent to their induction of EMT by TGF-\u03b2 (Figure 4b). However, this same TGF-\u03b2 treatment protocol failed to induce \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II interaction in FAK-depleted NMuMG cells, as (a) \u03b23 integrin immunocomplexes isolated from FAK-deficient NMuMG cells no longer included T\u03b2R-II, and (b) T\u03b2R-II immunocomplexes no longer included \u03b23 integrin (Figure 4b). Moreover, whereas the formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes was dependent on EMT in NMuMG cells, these same complexes were observed to form constitutively in 4T1 cells (Figure 4c). Importantly, depleting FAK expression in 4T1 cells also reduced the interaction between \u03b23 integrin and T\u03b2R-II, as \u03b23 integrin immunocomplexes isolated from FAK-deficient 4T1 cells no longer included T\u03b2R-II (Figure 4c). The formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes leads to Src-mediated phosphorylation of T\u03b2R-II on Y284, which coordinates the recruitment and binding of Grb2 to T\u03b2R-II. We now show that FAK deficiency prevented the interaction between T\u03b2R-II and Grb2, as Grb2 immunocomplexes isolated from FAK-depleted 4T1 cells no longer included T\u03b2R-II (Figure 4d).Finally, we found that the PTK activity of FAK was absolutely required for the formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes, as treatment of 4T1 cells with an effective concentration (see Additional data file 3d) of FAK inhibitors (PF-562271 and PF-573228) similarly abolished the interaction between \u03b23 integrin and T\u03b2R-II (Figure 4e). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that FAK expression and activity are required for the formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II:Grb2 complexes (Figure 4) and, consequently, for the initiation of aberrant oncogenic TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 3).FAK is critically involved in TGF-\u03b2-stimulated invasion of malignant MECsTo elucidate the significance of FAK in mediating oncogenic TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we first compared the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to induce EMT in control and FAK-deficient 4T1 cells. Figure 5a shows that FAK-depleted 4T1 cells failed to undergo the characteristic cell scattering that is normally associated with the induction of EMT (Figure 5a). In contrast to control cells, FAK-depleted 4T1 cells maintained cell-cell junctions that, in many respects, reflect the cortical actin patterns observed in unstimulated normal MECs (Figure 1a). We corroborated these morphologic findings by examining the differential expression of several genes associated with EMT in control and FAK-deficient 4T1 cells before and after their treatment with TGF-\u03b2. In doing so, we observed TGF-\u03b2 administration to reduce dramatically the 4T1 cell expression of E-cadherin (E-cad) protein and to increase the amount of PAI-1 protein in the conditioned media (Figure 5b). Importantly, both TGF-\u03b2-dependent responses were lost in 4T1 cells depleted for FAK expression (Figure 5b).Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is critical for TGF-\u03b2 stimulation of invasion in malignant mammary epithelial cells (MECs). (a) Fluorescent-conjugated phalloidin staining of control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) 4T1 cells indicated that FAK deficiency (shFAK) preserved cortical actin staining at cell-cell borders with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) stimulation. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated twice. (b) Control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) 4T1 cells were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for varying times, as indicated. Afterward, cell extracts or supernatants were immunoblotted with antibodies against E-cadherin (E-cad) or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), respectively. Immunoblotting for \u03b2-actin served as a loading control. Data are representative images from a single experiment that was repeated twice and show that FAK deficiency inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) stimulated by TGF-\u03b2. (c) Control (i.e., scram) and FAK-depleted (shFAK) 4T1 cells were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours. Afterward, the downregulation of the epithelial markers E-Cad and cytokeratin-19 (CK19), and the upregulation of the mesenchymal markers, PAI-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox2), and \u03b23 integrin (Beta3) were analyzed with semiquantitative real-time PCR. Data are expressed as the mean fold change (\u00b1 SEM) in gene expression relative to unstimulated cells observed in at least three independent experiments (*P < 0.05). (d) FAK deficiency specifically inhibited cell invasion induced by TGF-\u03b2. Data are the mean (\u00b1 SEM) invasion of each 4T1 cell line normalized to serum-stimulated invasion observed in three independent experiments completed in triplicate. (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.005). (e) FAK deficiency reversed T\u03b2R-II-mediated cellular invasion. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) invasion of each 4T1 cell line relative to its unstimulated counterpart (NS) observed in three independent experiments completed in triplicate. (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.001).More thoroughly to characterize the role of FAK in TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT, we also examined a panel of EMT markers by real-time PCR. As shown in Figure 5c, the downregulation of the epithelial markers E-cad and cytokeratin-19, which are characteristic features of EMT induced by TGF-\u03b2, was effectively prevented by depletion of FAK. Most interestingly, with the exception of PAI-1, the upregulation of mesenchymal markers was not appreciably affected by FAK deficiency (Figure 5c). The maintenance of an epithelial gene-expression profile is consistent with the epithelial morphology of FAK-depleted 4T1 cells (Figure 5a), and is further supported by a recent study in hepatocytes showing that the expression of a dominant-negative FAK prevents the downregulation of epithelial gene expression without affecting the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to induce mesenchymal gene expression.Consistent with the switch of TGF-\u03b2 from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter, we and others observed TGF-\u03b2 to induce the invasion of breast cancer cells, a result that is not recapitulated by normal MECs. We therefore monitored the ability of control and FAK-deficient 4T1 cells to invade synthetic basement membranes in response to TGF-\u03b2. Figure 5d shows that whereas FAK-deficiency failed to affect the invasion of 4T1 cells induced by a nonspecific serum stimulus, this same cellular condition abrogated the ability of 4T1 cells to undergo enhanced invasion in response to TGF-\u03b2 (Figure 5d). Previous findings by our laboratory established a model whereby constitutive expression of T\u03b2R-II increases the invasion of 4T1 cells. Importantly, depletion of FAK in \"hypermetastatic\" 4T1-T\u03b2R-II cells actually reversed the affects of T\u03b2R-II expression, as T\u03b2R-II-shFAK cells completely failed to invade to a serum stimulus (Figure 5e). Taken together, these data identify FAK as an essential player in mediating carcinoma cell EMT and invasion induced specifically by TGF-\u03b2.FAK inhibition reduces breast cancer growth and metastasisRecent data suggest that FAK is required for mammary tumor progression and metastasis; however, the precise mechanisms whereby FAK promotes tumor progression remain to be elucidated. Although FAK depletion had no affect on primary tumor growth (Figure 6a), bioluminescent imaging of mice bearing 4T1 tumors did show that pulmonary metastasis was reduced significantly upon FAK depletion (Figure 6b). In accordance with our in vitro findings (Figure 3), immunohistochemistry of 4T1 tumors demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and Smad2 with FAK depletion (Figure 6c). Thus, these findings suggest that FAK plays a critical role in regulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling and the metastasis of mammary tumors in mice.Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mediates tumor cell autonomous-driven metastasis and systemically driven mammary tumor growth. (a) Control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) 4T1 cells were engrafted onto the mammary fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/C mice. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) tumor volumes (n = 5) measured at the indicated time points after engraftment. (b) FAK-deficient 4T1 tumors displayed significantly decreased pulmonary metastasis. Data are the mean (\u00b1 SEM) pulmonary area flux units detected in Balb/C mice (n = 5) imaged at the indicated time points after engraftment (*P < 0.05). Shown are representative mice engrafted with control (i.e., scram) and FAK-deficient (shFAK) 4T1 cells (inset). (c) Immunostaining primary tumor sections with phospho-specific antibodies against p38 MAPK (p-p38) or Smad2 (p-smad2) showed intense nuclear localization of phosphorylated p38 MAPK at the invasive front of control (i.e., scram) tumors (black arrows). Tumors derived from FAK-deficient 4T1 cells exhibit significantly reduced phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of p38 MAPK (black arrows). Similarly, abundant phosphorylation of Smad2 (p-smad2) was readily detected near the invasive front of control (i.e., scram) 4T1 tumors (right of the line), but not in tumors arising from their FAK-deficient (shFAK) counterparts. (d) 4T1 cells were engrafted onto the mammary fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/C mice. One week after engraftment, the mice were left untreated (NS) or treated with the FAK inhibitor PF-562271 (PF-271; 50 mg/kg/day) for the duration of the experiment. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) tumor volumes (n = 5) measured at the indicated time points after engraftment (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.005). (e) Mice treated with PF-562271 as in panel (d) displayed significantly decreased pulmonary metastasis. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) pulmonary area flux units detected in Balb/C mice (n = 5) imaged at the indicated time points after engraftment (**P < 0.005). Shown are representative untreated (NS) or PF-562271 (PF-271)-treated mice (inset). (f) Control (NS) 4T1 mammary fat-pad tumors displayed a high degree of macrophage infiltration, as demonstrated by immunostaining for the F4/80 antigen. Macrophage infiltration was greatly reduced in tumor-bearing mice treated with PF-562271 (PF-271).In contrast to tumor cell depletion of FAK, therapeutic administration of the FAK inhibitor, PF-562271, significantly decreased the growth of primary 4T1 tumors (Figure 6d). The reduction in 4T1 tumor growth likely reflects diminished PTK activity of FAK, as tumors from biopsies of mice treated with PF-562271 possessed significantly less phosphorylated FAK as compared with their vehicle-treated counterparts (see Additional data file 3e). Moreover, PF-562271 decreased pulmonary metastasis in a fashion highly reminiscent of that observed in tumors depleted in FAK expression (Figure 6e). The difference in primary tumor growth between FAK-depleted cells (Figure 6a) and systemic FAK inhibition by PF-562271 (Figure 6d) suggests that FAK plays an important role in governing the composition or activity or both of nontumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, including the potential recruitment of systemic cell populations required for optimal mammary tumor growth and progression. Accordingly, we observed 4T1 tumors to exhibit strong staining for the macrophage marker F4/80, a result that was not recapitulated with PF-562271 administration (Figure 6f). Thus, we show for the first time that, in addition to the critical roles FAK plays in directing carcinoma cell function and behavior, the PTK activity of FAK is also clearly required for regulating innate immunity within the microenvironments of developing and progressing mammary tumors.We next used the 4T1-T\u03b2R-II model to access the specific role of FAK in TGF-\u03b2-driven breast cancer metastasis. As shown in Figure 7a, FAK depletion had no effect on primary tumor growth of 4T1-T\u03b2R-II cells. Furthermore, although FAK-deficient 4T1-T\u03b2R-II cells were still highly metastatic, FAK depletion did significantly decrease the immediate pulmonary dissemination of 4T1-T\u03b2R-II cells (Figure 7b). These data suggest that FAK selectively regulates the initial steps of tumor cell dissemination stimulated by TGF-\u03b2, a result that is consistent with our findings of the requirement of FAK in (a) mediating EMT stimulated by TGF-\u03b2 (Figure 5) and (b) preventing primary colonization of breast cancer cells in the lung (Figure 6b, weeks 2 to 3), but not their secondary outgrowth (Figure 6b, weeks 3 to 4). In addition, we found no differences in the ability of control or FAK-deficient 4T1 cells to colonize the lungs after their injection into the tail vein of Balb/C mice (see Additional data file 4c). Taken together, these data suggest that the coupling of TGF-\u03b2 to FAK promotes the initial invasion and exit of breast cancer cells from the primary tumor site. Moreover, and similar to control 4T1 cells, PF-562271 administration beginning 1 week after engraftment of 4T1-T\u03b2R-II cells significantly reduced their growth in mice (Figure 7c); however, this same treatment protocol had no effect on the subsequent metastasis of 4T1-T\u03b2R-II cells (Figure 7d).T\u03b2R-II-dependent, early primary tumor cell dissemination is dependent on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). (a) T\u03b2R-II (T\u03b2R-II)- or T\u03b2R-II-expressing/FAK deficient (T\u03b2R-II-shFAK) 4T1 cells were engrafted onto the mammary fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/C mice. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) tumor volumes (n = 5) measured at the indicated time points after engraftment. (b) FAK-deficient T\u03b2R-II tumors displayed significantly decreased primary tumor dissemination 1 week after tumor cell engraftment. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) pulmonary area flux units detected in Balb/C mice (n = 5) imaged at the indicated time points after engraftment (*P < 0.05). (c) One week after engraftment, 4T1-T\u03b2R-II tumor-bearing mice were left untreated (NS) or treated with the FAK inhibitor PF-562271 (PF-271; 50 mg/kg/day) for the duration of the experiment, as described in Figure 6c and 6d. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) tumor volumes (n = 5) measured at the indicated time points after engraftment (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.005). (d) Mice bearing 4T1-T\u03b2R-II tumors that were treated with PF-562271, as in panel (c) (n = 5) displayed similar pulmonary metastasis compared with controls. Data are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 SEM) pulmonary area flux units detected in Balb/C mice (n = 5) imaged at the indicated time points after engraftment.Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence that FAK activity can be inhibited chemotherapeutically as an effective two-pronged approach to reduce the growth and metastasis of breast cancers. Moreover, these results also show that amplified TGF-\u03b2 signaling in breast cancer cells is capable of driving early tumor cell dissemination from the primary mammary tumor.DiscussionTGF-\u03b2 is a principal player involved in suppressing mammary tumorigenesis by maintaining the composition of normal MEC microenvironments through its ability to inhibit the proliferation and survival of normal MECs. In stark contrast, mammary tumorigenesis has evolved a variety of mechanisms capable of subverting the tumor-suppressing functions of TGF-\u03b2 and of conferring oncogenic and metastatic properties on this multifunctional cytokine. Along these lines, elevated FAK expression is observed in a variety of human cancers, including those of the lung, uterus, mouth, thyroid, colon, ovary, and, most notably, the breast. Thus, upregulated expression of FAK is associated with the development and progression of human cancers. Accordingly, numerous models have shown that rendering breast cancer cells deficient in FAK inhibits their progression and the acquisition of metastatic phenotypes. The data shown herein identify FAK as an essential member of oncogenic \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II signaling complexes. FAK-deficiency not only prevented the physical interaction between \u03b23 integrin and T\u03b2R-II, but also abrogated oncogenic signaling by TGF-\u03b2 and its ability to induce EMT, invasion, and systemic dissemination of breast cancer cells. Thus, FAK is a critical effector of metastasis stimulated by TGF-\u03b2 in developing and progressing mammary tumors.Recent data also suggest that FAK mediates in vitro TGF-\u03b2 signaling and gene expression in fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and mesangial cells, further highlighting the biologic importance of this signaling and scaffolding molecule.Through the use of the recently developed small-molecule inhibitors of FAK (i.e., PF-562271 and PF-573228), we specifically defined the PTK activity of FAK as being essential for mediating the formation of \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes. Moreover, therapeutic administration of PF-562271 reduced pulmonary metastasis in a manner reminiscent of that observed with total FAK depletion, suggesting that the PTK activity of FAK, as opposed to its scaffolding function, is the major aspect of the this molecule required for cellular metastasis. A clinically relevant finding of our study was that FAK clearly is required for the initiation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and its stimulation of EMT and invasion. More important, we showed for the first time that amplified TGF-\u03b2 signaling through increased T\u03b2R-II expression was sufficient in subverting the metastatic benefit of FAK chemotherapies, by using the same treatment protocol that was sufficient in reducing the metastasis of wild-type breast cancer cells. These data suggest that TGF-\u03b2 drives cellular dissemination from the primary tumor and early metastatic lesion formation, processes that absolutely require FAK expression and PTK activity. This conclusion is wholly supported by recent independent studies showing that both FAK and TGF-\u03b2 signaling are critically involved in these early steps of tumor dissemination, but not metastatic outgrowth.Mechanistically, we showed that FAK becomes activated with TGF-\u03b2-mediated induction of EMT, a process that is dependent on Src and \u03b23 integrin (Figure 1). Moreover, we present data to suggest that TGF-\u03b2-stimulated upregulation of \u03b23 integrin acts as a negative-feedback mechanism regulating the transcription not only of itself, but also that of FAK. Thus, these and our previous findings indicate that the transactivation of FAK and Src facilitates the interaction between \u03b23 integrin and T\u03b2R-II, leading to phosphorylation of T\u03b2R-II at Y284 and its interaction with Grb-2. Indeed, the formation of integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes, as well as other signaling modules involving TGF-\u03b2 receptors, appears to be governed by a variety of protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications.Overall, the formation of these aberrant complexes function to promote the oncogenic activities of TGF-\u03b2 in developing and progressing breast cancers. Our findings also point to the importance of thoroughly defining the composition and function of these TGF-\u03b2 signaling complexes in normal and metastatic cells. As such, we show here that \u03b23 integrin:T\u03b2R-II complexes are present constitutively in metastatic MECs, but only form in normal MECs upon their induction of EMT. Accordingly, disruption of FAK decreases TGF-\u03b2-induced Smad2/3 activation and completely abrogates p38 MAPK stimulation in metastatic MECs, whereas FAK depletion in normal MECs only partially blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced p38 MAPK activation with no affect on Smad2/3 activity.Clearly, these data demonstrate the increased dependence of metastatic breast cancer cells on FAK to facilitate oncogenic TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Moreover, they suggest that targeting FAK and other constituents of the focal adhesion complex, such as integrins, p130Cas, talin, or paxillin, holds the potential to inactivate specifically the oncogenic activities of TGF-\u03b2 in malignant MECs. Moreover, our findings suggest that the development and use of such a chemotherapeutic regimen would have little impact on altering the tumor-suppressor function of TGF-\u03b2 in normal MECs.A scientifically and medically important finding of this study was the difference noted between tumor cell depletion of FAK and systemic FAK inhibition by using PF-562271. We demonstrated a drastic diminution in primary tumor growth in control and T\u03b2R-II-expressing 4T1 cells after PF-562271 treatment. These data point to an important role for FAK in regulating the composition and behavior of breast cancer stroma, particularly the recruitment of bone marrow-derived and other systemic immune cells whose presence is critical for mammary tumorigenesis. To this end, we show a drastic reduction in tumor-infiltrating macrophages with FAK inhibition. Although a full characterization of the role for FAK in governing mammary stromal function clearly is warranted and currently is ongoing in our laboratory, the data presented here undoubtedly identify a novel tumor microenvironmental function for FAK that has yet to be fully appreciated.ConclusionsIn summary, we demonstrate that FAK is activated upon TGF-\u03b2-mediated induction of EMT in a manner that requires \u03b23 integrin and Src, and that the PTK activity of FAK is required for the physical linkage between \u03b23 integrin and T\u03b2R-II, thereby generating the formation of oncogenic TGF-\u03b2 signaling complexes. Indeed, our findings establish FAK as an essential player that facilitates the oncogenic conversion of TGF-\u03b2 in developing and progressing mammary tumors, leading to their acquisition of invasive and metastatic phenotypes in response to TGF-\u03b2. Finally, we provide compelling evidence that inhibiting the PTK activity of FAK or its expression is sufficient to reduce the overall metastatic burden of highly aggressive breast cancers, and more specifically, that amplified TGF-\u03b2 signaling in these same tumors is capable of driving the earliest steps of primary tumor metastasis, processes that are critically dependent on FAK.AbbreviationsE-cad: epithelial cadherin; EGF: epidermal growth factor; EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition; FAK: focal adhesion kinase; FBS: fetal bovine serum; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEC: mammary epithelial cell; p130Cas: Crk-associated substrate; PAI-1: plasminogen activator hnhibitor-1; pMSCV: plasmid murine stem cell virus; PTK: protein tyrosine kinase; shRNA: short hairpin RNA; T\u03b2R-I: TGF-\u03b2 receptor type I; T\u03b2R-II: TGF-\u03b2 receptor type II; TGF: transforming growth factor; WT: wild type.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMKW participated in designing the study, acquiring the data, interpreting the data, analyzing the data, and preparing the manuscript.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown. Methods: Four CAF cultures were isolated from chemotherapy-na\u00efve BC patients and characterized for ER\u03b136 expression and the NanoString gene expression panel using isolated RNA. Conditioned media from CAF cultures were used to assess the influence of CAFs on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells using a matrigel 3D culture assay.

HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

Despite its improved treatment, the overall survival rates still hover around 47% and pose a serious threat to overall health worldwide. Recently, the crosstalk between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment has been found to contribute to tumor growth and metastasis and now is a promising therapeutic target. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the second most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, are found to be implicated in poor clinical outcomes for patients with OSCC and several other tumor types.CAFs promote tumor growth, survival and metastasis by remodeling the extracellular matrix, reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment and reprogramming tumor metabolism. Among them, the metabolic reprogramming of CAFs reflects their adaption to tumor energy requirements, as metabolic change is one of the six hallmarks of cancer. However, CAFs display different metabolic characteristics because of metabolic heterogeneity between tumors. For example, in breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma, the CAFs-mediated reverse Warburg effect, where CAFs undergo anaerobic glycolytic activity to release lactate to nearby tumor cells, has been reported. However, in ovarian cancer CAFs mediated anaerobic glycolysis in tumor and released lactate to CAFs via LINC00092. These contradictory findings indicated that the reciprocal metabolic change between CAFs and cancer cell is far more complicated than we previously anticipated. Therefore, it is important to explore the mechanism of the CAFs-mediated metabolic switch to identify subtype-selective metabolic vulnerabilities.It is now emerging that NADH levels are associated with cancer progression and subsequently oxidative phosphorylation systems (OXPHOS) are essential for cancers. Santidrian and Wang et al. found that decreased NAD+/NADH levels rendered tumor cells more aggressive and increased metastasis. In addition, Zhao et al. showed that increasing the NAD+/NADH ratio by using chemical compounds led to cell death. However, how NAD+/NADH is regulated by microenvironmental cues is unknown.Integrins are a family of cell-surface glycoproteins that sense the extracellular matrix and trigger a range of cellular responses to control cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival and differentiation. Recent evidence has shown that integrins also control cell metabolism. As they are important for a range of physiological functions, these receptors also play an essential role in promoting a more malignant tumor cell phenotype in cancer. Integrin beta 2 (ITGB2), one of integrin subunits, was previously found to be exclusively expressed in leukocytes. It promotes leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and the ensuing extravasation. However, its expression and functions in CAFs have not previously been discovered. In the present study we found that ITGB2 was upregulated in CAFs than in the matched NFs in OSCC and was associated with poor clinical characteristics and outcomes. Mechanically, ITGB2 promoted glycolysis via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in CAFs and secreted lactate to promote OSCC proliferation by enhancing mitochondrial OXPHOS capacities. Using metformin to target the mitochondrial complex I system could effectively inhibit the pro-proliferative effects of ITGB2-expressing CAFs.Material and MethodsCell cultureCAFs and NFs were obtained from tumor samples and the matched adjacent non-tumor tissues of patients with OSCC treated at the Nanjing Stomatological Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University as previously described. CAFs, which were demonstrated in our previous study, were characterized by the expression of \u03b1-SMA and the lack of expression of CK and maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and cultured fewer than 12 passages to ensure biologic similarity to the original specimens. HSC3, SAS, CAL27, SCC9, SCC131 and CAL33 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2.ReagentsITGB2 (#73663), GluT4 (#2213), Akt (#4691), Phospho-Akt (#4060), PI3Kinase (#4292), Anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked Antibody (#7074), Anti-mouse IgG and HRP-linked Antibody (#7076) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. ITGB2 (ab53009), Phospho-PI3Kinase (ab182651) and a-SMA (ab5694) were obtained from the Abcam company. ITGB2 (10554-1-AP), HIF1a (66730-1-Ig), MCT1 (20139-1-AP), MCT4 (22787-1-AP), LDHB (14824-1-AP) and PDK4 (12949-1-AP) were obtained from the Proteintech company. ITGB2 (AF1730) was purchased from R&D. Secondary anti-rabbit IgG Dylight 680 (#35568), anti-rabbit IgG Dylight 488 (#35553) and anti-mouse IgG Dylight 800 (#35521) were obtained from ThermoFisher.The primer sequences used in this study were obtained from commercial sources and are displayed in Table S1.ImmunoblottingThe cell lysates were acquired by scraping the cultured cells and were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors on ice. Equal amounts of proteins were separated through SDS-PAGE and blocked in 3% BSA. After incubation with primary antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight and HRP conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h, protein bands were detected by the protein imaging system (Tanon5200). Immunoblots for the presented data were analyzed from at least 3 experimental repeats.Immunofluorescence (IFC) stainFor cell immunofluorescence, cells mounted on cover glasses were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked in 5% BSA for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with primary antibody at 4 \u00b0C overnight and dye light conjugated antibodies for 1 hour. The images were acquired with the Nikon Ti Eclipse Confocal Microscope. For frozen immunofluorescence, the slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then treated with the procedures described above.RNA analysisRNA was obtained using Trizol reagent following the manufacturer's procedure and then reversed into cDNA using HiScript III RT SuperMix (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd). The relevant expression of the genes was determined via AceQ\u00ae qPCR SYBR\u00ae Green Master Mix (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd).Tissue samplesSamples and the follow-up data of 80 OSCC patients who received cancer surgery from 2008 to 2010 were obtained from the head and neck tumor biobank of Nanjing Stomatological hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University. All patients had received follow-up examinations every two months from the date of surgery to the date of disease progression after surgery until death. The study has been approved by the ethics committee for clinical study of Nanjing Stomatological Hospital.Flow cytometryTo isolate CAFs and leucocytes, the tumors from patients with OSCC were digested and dissociated using the gentleMACS\u2122 Dissociator to obtain a single-cell suspension and then incubated with PE conjugated anti-ITGB2 antibody and FITC conjugated anti-CD45 antibody for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were sorted by Sony Sorting Flow Cytometer.To detect membrane ITGB2, CAFs were trypsinized and incubated in Staining Buffer containing APC conjugated anti-CD18 antibody for 30 min and then analyzed using the BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer. To detect the total ITGB2 in flowcytometry, the cells were fixed and permeabilized by using the Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set and then treated with the procedures described as above.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysisSections of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were deparaffinized and subjected to antigen retrieval using 10 mM citrate buffer (92 \u00b0C for 30 min). Gene expression was evaluated according to stain intensity and the percentage of positive cells. The intensity of staining was graded as 1 = weak staining, 2 = moderate staining and 3 = strong staining. The percentage of stained cells was graded as 0 = 0-5%, 1 = 6-25%, 2 = 26-50%, 3 = 51-75% and 4 = 75-100%. The final score was obtained by multiplying the two scores. All scorings were conducted by two pathologists without knowledge of the patients' clinical characteristics or outcome.Plasmid construction and lentivirus infectionsiRNA targeting ITGB2, MCT1, MCT4 and LDHB were cloned into pLVX-Puro, i.e. pLVX-shITGB2, pLVX-shMCT1, pLVX-shMCT4 and pLVX-shLDHB. The full length of the cDNA sequences of ITGB2 was cloned into lentivirus vector pCDH-CMV, i.e. pCDH-ITGB2.Plasmids were transfected into 293T cells via Polyjet and the supernatants were collected 2 days after transfection. After being filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm PES filter, the viral supernatants were either directly added to CAFs or NFs or stored at -80 \u00b0C.Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry untargeted analysisWhen cells were 80% to 90% confluent, cells were collected in 10-cm dishes and sent to Dr. Tong Xie (Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine). Materials and reagents for GC-MS analysis were prepared according to the previous method. GC-MS analysis was performed by using a Trace 1310 Gas Chromatograph equipped with an AS1310 auto sampler which connected to a TSQ 8000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).Lactate and glucose assessmentThe cell culture supernatants were collected two days after seeding. The supernatants were assessed by using an L-lactate assay kit (EFLLC-100) and glucose assay kit (DIGL-100) according to the manufacturer's instructions.XenograftsFour-week-old male NOD/SCID mice were housed and maintained in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions. 1) HSC3-Ctrl (1\u00d7106 cells) & CAFs-Ctrl (5\u00d7105 cells), HSC3-Ctrl (1\u00d7106 cells) & CAFs-ITGB2 (5\u00d7105 cells), HSC3-shMCT1 (1\u00d7106 cells) & CAFs-Ctrl (5\u00d7105 cells), HSC3-shMCT1 (1\u00d7106 cells) & CAFs-ITGB2 (5\u00d7105 cells) were injected into the flanks of nu/nu mice, respectively. Tumor volume was measured with calipers in two dimensions, and volumes were estimated using the equation V = Length \u00d7 Width \u00d7 Width/2.Public database and GSEAGene expression analyses of human tumor stroma were retrieved from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), including GSE40595 and GSE26910. Array data were analyzed using the Gene-set enrichment analysis software [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (USA)] according to the program guidelines.Proliferation ratesCells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates, with an initial seeding density of 3,000 cells. The medium was then changed to CAFs-conditioned medium (CM) which was boiled at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min or filtered through a 3-kDa cutoff filter after cell adhesion. After 24 h incubation, the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 \u03bcL CCK8 solution. The plates were then measured using a microplate reader at 450 nm. The proliferation rate was calculated based on the following formula: [(As-Ab)/(Ac-Ab)] \u00d7100%, where As is the absorbance of tested wells, Ac is the absorbance of control wells and Ab is the absorbance of blank wells.ATP, NADH and mitochondrial complex I activity quantitationATP, NADH and mitochondrial complex I were measured using the specific kit (ATP kit: Beyotime S0026, NADH kit: Beyotime S0175, mitochondrial complex I activity: Abcam ab109903) following the manufacturer's instructions.Data analysesResults are expressed as the means \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.) from at least three independent experiments. Single comparisons between two groups were determined by the Student t test. Comparisons between multiple groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey post-test. p values <0.05 were considered significant.ResultsITGB2 is upregulated in CAFs in OSCC tumor microenvironmentSince CAFs promote OSCC progression, RNA-sequencing was performed to identify different gene expression profiles between CAFs and the matched NFs from 5 patients with OSCC. Among the most significant upregulated genes, ITGB2, which was reported to be exclusively expressed in leukocytes, was found to be overexpressed in CAFs and caught our attention (Table S2). To confirm its expression profiles in the OSCC tumor microenvironment, we isolated tumor infiltrating immune cells (TILs) and CAFs using CD45 and PDGFRb antibodies by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A-B). RT-PCR results showed no significantly different ITGB2 mRNA levels between CAFs and immune cells, indicating that ITGB2 was not restricted to immune cells and was also expressed in CAFs (Fig. 1C). In addition, IFC analysis of ITGB2 in the OSCC tumor microenvironment also showed that ITGB2 expression was positively correlated with CAFs markers, \u03b1-SMA, further confirming ITGB2 expression in CAFs (Fig. 1D).To confirm the RNA sequence results of CAFs and NFs, 5 pairs of CAFs and NFs were collected. Both RT-PCR and western blot analyses showed that ITGB2 expression levels were significantly upregulated in CAFs compared with those of the matched NFs, indicating its high expression in the OSCC stroma (Fig. 1E-F and Fig. S1). In addition, the investigation of stromal gene expression in normal and cancerous tissues showed that ITGB2 was also significantly upregulated in some other types of tumor stroma, including prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer, indicating ITGB2 upregulation in CAFs was not restricted to OSCC stroma (Fig. 1G). Meanwhile, the location of ITGB2 in CAFs was measured by flowcytometry and IFC. Both showed that ITGB2 was not exclusively expressed in membranes of CAFs but was also detected in cytoplasm. Our results indicated that the expression pattern of ITGB2 in CAFs differed from leukocytes but was similar to cancer cells where ITGB2 was also discovered in cytoplasm (Figs. S2A, S2B).Higher ITGB2 expression in CAFs correlates with poor clinical characteristics and outcomes of OSCC patientsIHC analysis of ITGB2 was further performed in 80 patients with OSCC. Results showed that ITGB2 was widely distributed throughout the tumor microenvironment, including cancer cells, TILs and CAFs (Fig. 2A-B). As ITGB2 was expressed both in immune cells and CAFs, we then investigated the diagnostic value of ITGB2 expression in CAFs and TILs. Table 1 showed that higher ITGB2 expression in TILs was only associated with older age. On the contrary, its higher expression in CAFs was associated with higher TNM and deeper DOI (Depth of invasion) (Table 1, Fig. 2C). In addition, higher ITGB2 expression in CAFs was accompanied by increased Ki67 positive cells (Fig. 2D), while no correlation between ITGB2 expression in TILs and DOI was found (Table 1). Kaplan-Meier analysis further revealed that patients with higher ITGB2 expression had shorter survival and earlier recurrence (Fig. 2E, F). The above results revealed that that aberrant ITGB2 expression in CAFs was correlated with poor clinical characteristics and outcomes, indicating that ITGB2hi CAFs may promote OSCC cell proliferation.ITGB2-expressing CAFs might promote OSCC cell proliferation via metabolitesTo explore the function of ITGB2 in CAFs, NFs for ITGB2 overexpression experiments and CAFs for ITGB2 knockdown experiments were performed, and HSC3 cells were then cultured in a fibroblasts-cultured medium (Fig. 3A-B). When ITGB2 was overexpressed in NFs, the growth rates of OSCC were significantly upregulated, while its growth rates were significantly decreased when ITGB2 was silenced in CAFs (Fig. 3C-D). Similarly, the colony forming number of HSC3 increased when ITGB2 was overexpressed and decreased when ITGB2 was silenced (Fig. 3E-F), indicating ITGB2-expressing CAFs promoted tumor cell proliferation.Interestingly, we noticed that the color of the NFs-ITGB2 culture medium was yellow, while that of the NFs-Ctrl was pink (Fig. 3G). Similar results were also found in CAFs when ITGB2 was silenced (Fig. 3H). To further prove that the acidic catabolites promoted OSCC proliferation, we seeded HSC3 in heated fibroblasts cultured medium, i.e. CM, in which all proteins had been denatured and lost function. As shown in Fig. 3I and 3J, even if the medium was heated, CM-NFs-ITGB2 still promoted OSCC proliferation, and knocking down ITGB2 in CAFs affected HSC3 proliferation. In addition, the pro-proliferative effects of CM-CAFs were abrogated by adding ITGB2 neutralizing antibody (Fig. S3). We then performed an EDU cell proliferation assay of HSC3 in CM. Similarly, EDU-positive cells in CM-NFs-ITGB2 increased markedly more than in CM-NFs-Ctrl and decreased more in CM-CAFs-shITGB2 than in CM-CAFs-Ctrl (Fig. 3K). Moreover, after the medium had passed through a 3 kDa cutoff filter that removed molecules larger than 3 kDa, the ITGB2 expression level-dependent ability to regulate cell growth was retained (Fig. S4A, S4B). Taken together, the culture medium of ITGB2 expressing CAFs contained small molecules (< 5 kDa) that withstood high temperature, indicating the molecules could be metabolites.Glycolytic activity is enhanced in ITGB2-expressing CAFsIn order to explore the biological mechanism that explains the elevated acidic catabolites accompanied by ITGB2 upregulation in CAFs, GSEA was performed using GSE40595 and GSE26910 data. Both databases showed that the gene set of HALLMARK_GLYCOLYSIS was highly enriched in the ITGB2-high group (Fig. 4A), which indicated that ITGB2 was involved in glycolysis in CAFs. Consistently, GC-MS analyses of NFs-Ctrl, NFs-ITGB2, CAFs-Ctrl and CAFs-shITGB2 cells showed that some glycolytic metabolite ratios increased between NFs-ITGB2 and NFs-Ctrl, and decreased between CAFs-shITGB2 and CAFs-Ctrl, such as glucose-6-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate and lactate (Fig. 4B).To determine whether ITGB2 mediated glycolytic activity in fibroblasts, we measured the glycolytic gene expression in NFs-Ctrl, NFs-ITGB2, CAFs-Ctrl and CAFs-shITGB2. Both western blots and RT-PCR showed that the genes regulating anaerobic glycolysis, i.e. HIF1a, MCT4, LDHB, PDK3 and Glut4, were overexpressed in the NFs-ITGB2 group and down regulated in the CAFs-shITGB2 group (Fig. 4C and 4D). Accordingly, NFs-ITGB2 showed an increase in extracellular lactate levels and a drop in glucose levels compared with NFs-Ctrl. Correspondingly, less lactate and more glucose were also found in the CAFs-shITGB2 group compared with the CAFs-Ctrl group (Fig. 4E and 4F). In addition, glycolytic proteins and lactate were also downregulated in CAFs treated with ITGB2 neutralizing antibody (Fig. S5A, S5B). All these results suggested ITGB2 regulated glycolysis activity in CAFs, but the mechanisms still need to be explored.ITGB2 regulates glycolysis via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in CAFsWe then explored the molecular link between ITGB2 expression and glycolytic adaption. Although the WikiPathway database showed that 14 pathways were related to ITGB2 (Table S3), only the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was also involved in the glycolytic pathway (Fig. 5A). Next, we assessed whether ITGB2 regulated glycolysis in CAFs via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. As shown in Fig. 5B, the protein levels of pi-PI3K, pi-AKT and pi-mTOR increased when ITGB2 was overexpressed in NFs and decreased when ITGB2 was silenced in CAFs, showing a close relationship between ITGB2 expression and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. To further prove the role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in glycolysis regulation via ITGB2, we constructed CAFs-ITGB2, which consistently expressed ITGB2. ITGB2 overexpression in CAFs led to enhanced expression of pi-PI3K, pi-AKT, pi-mTOR and the aforementioned key glycolytic enzymes. However, the correspondence increase of the key glycolytic enzymes was abrogated by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Accordingly, CAFs treated with LY294002 were unable to produce more lactate and promote HSC3 proliferation even when ITGB2 was overexpressed (Fig. 5E, 5F). All the results demonstrated that ITGB2 regulated glycolysis via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in CAFs. Then we reexamined the OSCC samples. The IHC analyses of LDHB and pi-AKT expression in 34 OSCC specimens also showed that higher ITGB2 expression levels were correlated with higher pi-AKT and LDHB expression (Fig. 5D), further supporting the critical role of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in ITGB2-mediated glycolysis.Lactate secreted from ITGB2-expressing CAFs promotes OSCC proliferationGiven that lactate is the major end product of glycolysis, we next investigated whether lactate was responsible for the pro-proliferative ability of ITGB2-expressing CAFs. As shown in Fig. 6A, extracellular lactate levels dropped when HSC3 cells were in CM, suggesting that lactate was utilized by cancer cells. To verify this, we constructed HSC3-shMCT1, silencing the lactate transporter MCT1 expression (Fig. S6). The results showed that extracellular lactate levels remained unchanged compared with the CM without cell incubation when MCT1 was silenced. Next, we hypothesized that whether the absorbed lactate might be linked to OSCC proliferation. The relative cell growth was lower when HSC3 cells were incubated in the CM-CAFs-shITGB2 where lactate was relatively lower (Fig. 6B). However, adding lactate reversed the decreased cell growth rates of cells in CM-CAFs-shITGB2, suggesting the lactate secreted by CAFs played a pivotal role in OSCC proliferation. We then tested it by using HSC3-shMCT1 cells. Knocking down MCT1 in HSC3 delayed cell growth. Although incubation in CM-CAFs-shITGB2 also retarded the cell proliferation rates, adding lactate failed to recover the proliferation rate, indicating metabolites other than lactate which are transferred by MCT1 may also regulate OSCC proliferation (Fig. 6B). Therefore, in order to prove lactate secreted from ITGB2-expressing CAFs was responsible for the increased proliferation rates of OSCC, we silenced LDHB, which previously had been found to be overexpressed and to produce lactate in ITGB2 expressing CAFs. When LDHB was silenced in CAFs, lactate was significantly down regulated even in ITGB2 overexpressing CAFs (Fig. S7A, S7B). Meanwhile, the pro-proliferative effects of ITGB2 overexpressing CAFs were abrogated when LDHB was silenced. However, adding lactate partially reversed the impaired pro-proliferative effects of silencing LDHB expression in ITGB2 over-expressing CAFs (Fig. S7C). In addition, we further silenced MCT4, which was reported to export lactate in ITGB2-expressing CAFs. As shown in Fig. S7D and S7E, when MCT4 was silenced, extracellular lactate was significantly lower, and cells cultured in CM-CAFs-ITGB2-shMCT4 grew relatively slower than in CM-CAFs-ITGB2. However, adding lactate in CM-CAFs-ITGB2-shMCT4 promoted cell growth (Fig. S7F). These findings indicated that lactate released from ITGB2 expressing CAFs promoted OSCC proliferation.In vivo, the effect of lactate from ITGB2 expressing CAFs was assessed by using a heterotopic oral cancer model. Whereas the tumors of the CAFs-ITGB2 and HSC3-Ctrl group grew more quickly and were larger than the CAFs-Ctrl and HSC3-Ctrl group, the pro-proliferative effects of CAFs-ITGB2 were impaired when MCT1 was silenced in HSC3 (Fig. 6-E). Molecular analyses of the resected tumors confirmed ITGB2 or MCT1 was overexpressed or silenced in the corresponding group (Fig. S8). IHC analyses of tumor tissues revealed that the expression of Ki67, MCT1 in tumor cells and LDHB in CAFs was enhanced in cancer cells when ITGB2 was overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 6F). Notably, silencing MCT1 abolished the enhanced expression of Ki67 (Fig. 6F). Similarly, the IHC analysis of 34 patients with OSCC also showed that higher ITGB2 expression in CAFs was associated with higher MCT1 expression in HSC3 (Fig. 6G-H). Collectively, the above results showed that lactate secreted by ITGB2 expressing CAFs was absorbed by tumor cells to promote tumor cell proliferation.NADH generated from lactate oxidation fuels mitochondria and promotes OSCC proliferationAlthough previous studies have reported that lactate \u201cfuels\u201d proliferation, the function and mechanism of lactate, especially secreted by CAFs, in OSCC development remained undiscovered. Here we found that lactate from ITGB2 expressing CAFs provided nearby HSC3 cells with ATP. Less ATP was detected in HSC3 cultured in CM-CAFs-shITGB2, whereas adding lactate reversed these effects (Fig. 7A). To confirm that extracellular lactate was responsible for the different ATP levels, MCT1 was silenced in HSC-3. The results showed although ATP levels of HSC3-shMCT1 cultured in CM-CAFs-Ctrl were still higher than those treated in CM-CAFs-shITGB2, adding lactate to the CAFs-shITGB2 medium failed to recover the decreased ATP levels, further supporting the idea that lactate from CAFs partly promoted ATP generation.To investigate how lactate was utilized to generate ATP, we focused on NADH, one product of lactate oxidation, because of its importance in cell proliferation (Fig. 7B). HSC3 cells cultured in CM-CAFs-shITGB2 resulted in decreased NADH, which was accompanied by reduced LDHA and LDHC protein expression levels compared with those of the control cells, whereas adding lactate reversed these effects, indicating lactate from ITGB2 expressing CAFs was oxidized by nearby cancer cells and generated NADH (Fig. 7C). Notably, ITGB2 mediated changes in NADH levels, and the lactate metabolizing enzymes of cells were largely abolished when MCT1 was silenced, regardless of the addition of lactate.Given that NADH was further oxidized in mitochondrial complex I and transferred an electron to generate ATP, we then assessed whether cells in CM-CAFs-shITGB2 exhibited downregulated mitochondrial complex I activity. Cells in CM-CAFs-shITGB2 exhibited attenuated mitochondrial complex I activity, whereas the addition of lactate restored it (Fig. 7D). Consistently, RT-PCR confirmed that ITGB2 mediated lactate release altered some gene expression of mitochondrial complex I in nearby cancer cells (Fig. 7E). Intriguingly, the mitochondrial number was also reduced when HSC3 cells were cultured in CM-CAFs-shITGB2 and the effect was reversed by lactate addition (Fig. 7F). To confirm that NADH is critical for lactate promoted OSCC proliferation, Oxamate, the inhibitor of lactate oxidation, was applied to HSC3 cells to inhibit lactate oxidation. As shown in Fig. S9A, the cells in the medium where lactate was the sole carbon were treated with Oxamate at 50 mM for 24 h and displayed reduced ATP levels. Accordingly, when cells were cultured in CM-CAFs-ITGB2 and Oxamate, the growth rates were downregulated. However, the impaired growth rates were reversed by adding NADH (Fig. S6B). Taken together, NADH generated from lactate oxidation promoted OSCC proliferation.As mitochondrial complex I activation appears to be responsible for ITGB2-mediated growth advantages, we hypothesized whether inhibiting mitochondrial complex I activity might disrupt the promoting proliferation effects of ITGB2-expressing CAFs. The six tested cells displayed different sensitivity to metformin. SCC131 required only 2 mM metformin to partially inhibit proliferation (Fig. 7K). In contrast, the other 5 cell lines were less sensitive to metformin, with 4 mM metformin doses inhibiting proliferation in HSC3, CAL27 and SCC172 or with potential higher doses in CAL33 and SAS. However, when CAL27 and SCC172 cells in CM-CAFs-Ctrl or CM-CAFs-ITGB2 were evaluated, they were more sensitive to metformin and required only 2 mM metformin to inhibit proliferation (Fig. 7-J). Notably, for HSC3, CAL33, SAS, higher ITGB2 expression potentiated inhibitory effects of metformin with lower metformin doses required to inhibit growth rates compared with those in CM-CAFs-Ctrl (Fig. 7G, 7H & 7L). Finally, this indicated that ITGB2 expressing in CAFs mediated OSCC growth relied on mitochondrial complex I activation and displayed a promising therapeutic target.DiscussionAlthough cancer has historically been regarded as a disorder of cell proliferation, increasing evidence suggests that it is a metabolic disease. To meet the bioenergetic, biosynthetic and redox demands of continuous cell growth, the metabolic programs of tumors are rewired. In addition, the infiltrated immune cells, blood vessels and stromal cells which co-exist and interact with tumor cells remodel their metabolic properties accordingly to share or compete for nutrients with cancer. For example, CAFs have been reported to undergo the Warburg effect to supply nutrients to nearby cancer cells to support their growth and metastasis. This phenomenon is known as reverse the Warburg effect and has been reported in a number of tumor types. However, oxidative stromal fibroblasts and glycolytic cancer cells have been found in a colorectal cancer model, indicating metabolic variety between tumor types. Thus, 1) whether the reverse Warburg effect occurred in OSCC; 2) its underling mechanism and 3) implication as the therapeutic target remain elusive. In this study, we revealed the mechanism of ITGB2-induced glycolysis in CAFs in OSCC. Compared with NFs, ITGB2 was found to be upregulated in CAFs and displayed enhanced glycolysis activity and lactate release via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Accordingly, the metabolite lactate derived from ITGB2-CAFs was immediately oxidized, and the generation of ATP was therefore increased by OXPHOS which required NADH, thus fueling OSCC proliferation. Notably, the pro-proliferative activity of ITGB2-expressing CAFs may also provide an advantage for cancer treatment as OSCC cells cultured in ITGB2-expressing CAFs medium render OSCC cells sensitive to metformin.ITGB2 is one of nine \u03b2 integrins and is reported to be predominantly expressed on immune cells. It is reported that it is involved in leucocyte extravasation, the binding and removal of fragments of complement, phagocytosis and intracellular killing of pathogenic microbes. However, these studies about ITGB2 focused on immune cells. The expression and mechanism of ITGB2 in other types of cells were largely unknown. Liu et al. recently reported that YAP induced ITGB2 expression in cancer cells to promote cell invasion through the endothelium in a manner mimicking leukocytes. In our study, ITGB2 was also found to be overexpressed in cancer cells, proved by IHC and immunofluorescence analyses of ITGB2 in OSCC patients. Apart from cancer cells, here we showed that ITGB2 was also expressed in CAFs. Compared with NFs, ITGB2 was overexpressed in CAFs in OSCC. In addition, GEO analysis showed that ITGB2 was also overexpressed in prostate cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer, indicating it is not an exclusive phenomenon in OSCC. Moreover, the study of 80 patients with OSCC found that only ITGB2 expression in CAFs other than infiltrating immune cells had diagnostic and prognostic values. This indicated that the function of ITGB2 varied between cell types in OSCC. However, the mechanism for regulating ITGB2 expression was undiscovered in our research and deserves further study.Traditionally, integrins have been viewed as important regulators of cell survival, proliferation, adhesion and migration. However, mounting evidence suggests that integrins also control various metabolic signals and pathways. ITGB1 was reported to be involved in glycolysis shift, amino acids transport and interact with MCT4 to mediate lactate transport. Apart from this, in triple negative breast cancer ITGB4 induced glycolysis in CAFs. Consistently, here we found that ITGB2 promoted glycolysis via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in CAFs. It is known as the reverse Warburg effect and is reported in several types of cancers. In breast cancer, oxidized ATM and ITGB4 were found to enhance glycolysis activity in CAFs. In melanoma, TGF-\u03b21 or PDGF induced CAFs to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis. In ovarian cancer, CXCL14 regulated LINC00092 which bound glycolytic enzyme fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB2) to promote its metastasis. Despite the reverse metabolic coupling in head and neck cancer found by Kumar et al., our finding showed that the reverse Warburg effect occurred in OSCC via ITGB2-mediated glycolysis in CAFs.Although lactate was previously known as a metabolic waste, mounting evidence now suggests it is a major carbon source in normal tissue and tumors. In this study, we found that lactate from ITGB2-expressing CAFs was absorbed and metabolized in OSCC to generate NADH to fuel OSCC proliferation. Targeting mitochondrial complex I effectively inhibited the pro-proliferative effects of ITGB2 expressing CAFs, further supporting lactate oxidation in OSCC. Although previous studies have shown multiple other metabolic fluxes of exogenous lactate, which can be utilized to generate lipids, glycogen and renew TCA cycle intermediates, we did not examine the other lactate fluxes. Therefore, it remains undiscovered whether the absorbed lactate can be used as carbon precursors other than as an oxidative fuel source. In addition, lactate was also a signaling molecular and instructed CAFs to produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In addition, Zhang et al. recently found that lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues serves as an epigenetic modification, indicating that lactate plays more roles than previously expected and deserves further study.Metformin is an anti-hyperglycemic agent and is found to be associated with improved cancer outcomes. It is reported that metformin decreases mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting the glycerol-phosphate shuttle or directly inhibiting mitochondrial complex I. As more NADH was generated in cells cultured in ITGB2-expressing CAFs and mitochondrial complex I activity was enhanced, we suggested metformin might interrupt the pro-proliferative effects of ITGB2-expressing CAFs. Although the tested OSCC cells displayed different sensitivity to metformin, we found that ITGB2 overexpression in CAFs rendered the cultured cells most sensitive to metformin. Given that lactate oxidation consumes NAD+ which was recycled from OXPHOS, we suspected it might be because of the unbalanced NAD+/NADH ratios for the cells cultured in ITGB2-expressing CAFs which required more NAD+ while metformin interrupted NAD+ recycling.In conclusion, our study found that ITGB2 played a critical role in CAFs to promote OSCC proliferation due to enhanced glycolysis activity in CAFs via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. ITGB2-expressing CAFs secreted lactate to nearby OSCC cells to generate ATP via OXPHOS. Meanwhile, we found that the pro-proliferative effects of ITGB2 was the Achilles' heel which rendered the nearby OSCC cells more sensitive to metformin and was a potential therapeutic target.Supplementary MaterialClinico-epidemiological study of oral squamous cell carcinoma: A tertiary care centre study in North IndiaOverall and disease-specific survival outcomes following primary surgery for oral squamous cell carcinoma: analysis of consecutive 67 patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts contribute to oral cancer cells proliferation and metastasis via exosome-mediated paracrine miR-34a-5pCancer-associated fibroblasts-heroes or villains?Epiregulin reprograms cancer-associated fibroblasts and facilitates oral squamous cell carcinoma invasion via JAK2-STAT3 pathwayA novel stromal lncRNA signature reprograms fibroblasts to promote the growth of oral squamous cell carcinoma via LncRNA-CAF/interleukin-33The biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerMechanisms and Implications of Metabolic Heterogeneity in CancerMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by IDH3alpha downregulationOxidized ATM-mediated glycolysis enhancement in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts contributes to tumor invasion through lactate as metabolic couplingITGB4-mediated metabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblastsThe reverse Warburg effect: glycolysis inhibitors prevent the tumor promoting effects of caveolin-1 deficient cancer associated fibroblastsReciprocal metabolic reprogramming through lactate shuttle coordinately influences tumor-stroma interplayLong Noncoding RNA LINC00092 Acts in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts to Drive Glycolysis and Progression of Ovarian CancerCancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate cancer malignancy via metabolic rewiring and mitochondrial transferMitochondrial complex I activity and NAD+/NADH balance regulate breast cancer progressionSoNar, a Highly Responsive NAD+/NADH Sensor, Allows High-Throughput Metabolic Screening of Anti-tumor AgentsIntegrins and cancer: regulators of cancer stemness, metastasis, and drug resistanceIntegrins and Cell Metabolism: An Intimate Relationship Impacting CancerHoming alone?

Recently, the glucose metabolism alterations (Warburg effect) was found as a new feature of CAFs. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of glycolysis in CAFs and its role in promoting the progression and development of tumors still remain to be researched.Added value of this studyIn this study, we found the enhanced glycolysis in CAFs compared to NFs and oxidized ATM can promote the glycolysis in breast CAF under hypoxia. To investigate the effect of oxidized ATM on glycolysis enhancement of CAFs and the underlying mechanism. We discovered that hypoxia-induced oxidized ATM induces glycolysis of CAFs by promoting the GLUT1 membrane translocation through the phosphorylation of GLUT1 at S490. In addition, the PKM2 expression in CAFs was up-regulated by the activation of ATM through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, the invasion of the breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549) was accelerated by the energy metabolic coupling mediator-lactate produced by CAFs. Besides, lactate between CAFs (released by MCT4) and tumor cells (absorbed via MCT1) may accelerate tumor cell invasion via activation of TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling and boost of mitochondrial activity in tumor cells. In summary, the influence of oxidized ATM on glycolysis of CAFs and the underlying mechanism about the pro-invasion impact of CAFs were investigated.Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings highlighted a novel mechanism by which stromal fibroblasts fuel tumor invasion through metabolic symbiosis and may indicate a new strategy targeting oxidized-ATM for breast cancer therapy.Alt-text: Unlabelled BoxIntroductionCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), namely activated fibroblasts, are the predominant residents in the breast tumor microenvironment. CAFs play indispensable roles in cancer progression including tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis directly or indirectly through paracrine pathways. Growing evidence show that tumor cells have altered metabolic patterns to meet both catabolic ATP producing and anabolic biomass synthesizing demands. For example, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells mainly depend on OxPhos whereas MCF-7 cells perform on OxPhos and glycolysis, and some cancer cells (e.g. CT26, glioma C6) are relied on glycolysis. Recently, metabolism of non-tumor cells in tumor microenvironment was reported, and the enhanced glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation has been characterized as a feature of CAFs. Hypoxia is a common feature in most tumors as a result of poor blood supply. Recently, hypoxia has been shown to promote the glycolysis of cancer cells and causes cellular oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. To date, whether and how hypoxia promotes the glycolytic activity in CAFs is not fully understood.The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein kinase (ATM) controls cellular response to DNA damage and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. For example, ATM can phosphorylate the downstream checkpoint kinase CHK2 and checkpoint proteins RAD17 and RAD9, thereby acting as an important regulator of cell cycle progression. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of DYRK2 and ATF2 plays critical roles in stress-induced genotoxicity and DNA damage response, respectively. All these findings demonstrate a DNA double-strand break (DSB)-dependent ATM activation. On the other hand, ATM could also be activated by oxidative stress (such as ROS), which is independent of DNA damage, this kind of ATM is called oxidized ATM or DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)-independent ATM. A growing number of studies have shown that ATM can be activated in the absence of DSB to regulate cell proliferation, and the activation of oxidized ATM has been found to regulate translocation of glucose transporter 4 in mouse muscle cells. In addition, as a redox sensor, ATM can be oxidized by mitochondria-derived ROS under hypoxia and functions as a regulator of p53 signaling and glucose metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In our work, we found an aberrant ATM signaling and sets of the altered metabolism-associated genes in breast CAFs compared with normal fibroblasts (NFs). These studies suggest oxidized ATM probably involves in the increased glycolytic activity in hypoxic CAFs. Nevertheless, whether and how oxidized ATM regulates the increased glycolytic activity of hypoxic CAFs remains to be determined.Energy metabolism is regulated by a series of genes including glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and several glycolysis related kinase such as pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). GLUT1 contributes to cancer cell metabolism reprogramming through transporting glucose from extracellular matrix for glycolysis, and the subcellular localization of GLUT1 may be a key regulator of glucose uptake. Posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation may influence the subcellular localization of GLUT1 in muscle skeletal cells. Whether phosphorylation of GLUT1 regulates increased glycolytic activity in CAFs is unknown. It has been shown that PKM2 expression is often elevated in many tumor cells, and plays a vital role in glycolysis by dephosphorylating phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate at the final rate-limiting step. PKM2 can be transcriptionally activated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family members and the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc. Hypoxia can also activate the PKM2 promoter by down-regulating Sp3, thereby removing the associated transcriptional suppressor to induce PKM2 expression. However, whether oxidized ATM, which is activated by hypoxia, regulates PKM2 expression or activation and consequently increased glycolytic activity is unclear.Recently, a reverse Warburg effect was observed in tumor tissues, in which host cells in the tumor microenvironment have been found to \u201cfuel\u201d tumor cell growth via energy transfer. For example, tumor cells can take up the metabolites lactate and pyruvate from the caveolin-1 deficient stromal fibroblasts to use them as energy fuels in mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to enhance tumor proliferation. The ketone bodies (e.g. BDH1 and HMGCS2) supplied by catabolic fibroblasts can increase mitochondrial mass in carcinoma cells, thus enhancing tumor cell growth and invasion capacity. Increased glutamines from fibroblasts potentiate survival and tamoxifen-resistance in breast epithelial cancer cells. However, the detail molecular mechanisms of metabolites from stromal cells to fuel tumor cell growth and invasion keep in unveil. Recently, Dr. Dong Chul Lee and his colleagues reveal that lactate can bind as stabilizer to the NDRG3 protein to mediate hypoxia-induced activation of Raf-ERK pathway, thereby promoting angiogenesis and cell growth.In this study, we investigated the effect of oxidized ATM on the increased glycolytic activity of CAFs and the underlying mechanism. We found that hypoxia-induced oxidized ATM induces glycolytic activity of CAFs by phosphorylating GLUT1 at S490 and increasing PKM2 expression. Moreover, the energy metabolic coupling mediator lactate, produced by CAFs, promotes breast cancer cell invasion by activating the TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling axis and increase mitochondrial activity in tumor cells. These findings reveal a novel role of CAFs in pro-invasion breast tumors, and may implicate an oxidative ATM-targeting strategy for breast tumor treatment.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and NFs were isolated from breast tumor tissues and their paired normal tissues and identified with CAF-related biomarkers, respectively; and were immortalized by human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) as described previously. NFs and CAFs were cultured in DMEM (C11995500BT, Gibco) with 10% FBS (10099-144, Gibco, Austrlia); Human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (C11875500BT, Gibco) with 10% FBS at 37\u202f\u00b0C in a tri-gas incubator containing 5% CO2 under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2 and 94% N2) condition. The genotyping of these breast cancer cells shared >94% of the STR loci with the ATCC original clones by STR identification (Genewiz, Suzhou).RNA interference, plasmids and engineered fibroblastsAll the synthetic short hairpin RNA (shRNA) oligonucleotides, lentivirus expression vector of shRNA against ATM, GLUT1, PKM2, MCT4, MCT1 and the control shRNA were purchased from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The sequences of shRNA are listed in Supplementary Table 1. The wild type GLUT1 S490 (FHPLGADSQV; WT), mutant GLUT1 S490A (from FHPLGADSQV to FHPLGADAQV to lead a hypo-phosphorylated GLUT1) constructs were generated by GenePharma (Shanghai, China) and inserted into pcDNA-Flag tagged plasmid to get pcDNA-Flag-GLUT1 (WT) and pcDNA-Flag-GLUT1 mutant (S490A). The pcDNA3-Flag-ATM construct was obtained from Addgene.The engineered CAFs with a stable expression of shATM, shGLUT1, shPKM2, shMCT4 and the breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) with a stable expression of shMCT1 were established using the lentivirus infection as described elsewhere. In order to establish the engineered GLUT1 WT- and GLUT1 mutant-CAFs, the endogenous glut1 of CAFs was knocked down by GLUT1 shRNA (named CAF/glut1 KD). The ectopic WT, mutant GLUT1 S490A was then transfected into CAFs to acquire the engineered CAFs stably expressing WT (CAF/ecto-WT) or mutant GLUT1 (CAF/ecto-S490A).Immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then sectioned into 4\u202f\u03bcm of sections. IHC was performed according to protocols of the manufacturor. The sections were incubated with rabbit anti-MMP2, MMP9, p-ATM, GLUT1, PKM2 and TGF\u03b21 polyclonal antibody (1:200, Bioworld) overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C. Then, the sections were sequentially incubated with polyperoxidase-anti-rabbit IgG (ZSBiO) for 30\u202fmin at 37\u202f\u00b0C, then stained with diaminobenizidine.Immunofluorescence staining was done following the standard protocol as described previously.

IHC and IF images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Tokyo, Japan).Western blotting analysisWestern blotting analysis was performed as described previously. Briefly, total cell proteins were obtained using RIPA lysis buffer (P0013B, Beyotime, China), quantified with the BCA protein assay kit (P0012, Beyotime). 50\u202f\u03bcg of total proteins were separately electrophoresed in 8%\u201312% SDS-PAGE gel, subsequently incubated with appropriate primary antibodies as followings: FN (ab23750, abcam,1:1000), FAP (ab53066, abcam,1:1000), \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, abcam,1:1000), ATM (2873, CST, 1:1000), p-ATM (5883, CST, 1:1000), \u03b3H2AX (9718, CST, 1:1000), CHK2-T68 (ab32148, abcam, 1:1000), Na+/K+ ATPase (ab58457, abcam, 1:800), Hsp90 (ab13492, abcam, 1:800), AKT (4685, CST, 1:1000), p-AKT (12694 s, CST, 1:1000), GLUT1 (ab14683, abcam, 1:500), p-ST/Q (6966\u202fs, CST, 1:1000), PKM2 (sc365684, Santa Cruz, 1:500), MCT4 (ab74109,1:1000), MCT1 (ab90582,1:1000) TGF\u03b21 (ab675195, abcam, 1:1000), P38 (bs4635, bioworld, 1:1000), p-P38 (bs3566, bioworld, 1:1000), MMP2 (ab92538, abcam, 1:800), and MMP9 (ab76003, abcam, 1:800), GLUT3 (ab41525,1:800), HK2 (ab104836,1:800), HPI (ab86950,1:1000), LDHA (ab101562,1:1000). The appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (ZSGBBIO, China) was used as secondary antibodies. The protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan).Immunoprecipitation-Western blotting (IP-WB) assaysCo-immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described. The cell lysates were pre-treated with Protein A/G Magnetic Beads (B23202, Selleckchem, TX, USA), and then immunoprecipitated with 2\u202f\u03bcg of p-ST/Q (6966\u202fs, CST, Boston) and 20\u202f\u03bcl Protein A/G Magnetic Beads at 4\u202f\u00b0C overnight. After washing with lysis buffer carefully, the protein complexes were released from the beads by boiling in 2\u00d7 loading buffer and subjected to Western blotting assays.Detection of cell membrane GLUT1 with biotinylation of cell surface proteinsIn brief, CAFs were cultured in growth medium to around 85% confluence, and then cultured under the normoxic or hypoxia condition in FBS-free medium for 8\u202fh with or without Ku60019 treatment. After washing with pre-cooled PBS, membrane proteins form cells were labeled with 1\u202fMm EZ-Link Biotin (Thermo Scientific) on ice for 30\u202fmin followed by quenched with biotin quench solution (250\u202fmm Trizma Base). Cells were collected with Biotin Lysis Buffer and centrifuged at 14000\u202fr/min for 10\u202fmin to obtain the supernatants containing membrane proteins labeled with biotin. Streptavidin beads (Thermo Scientific) were used to immunoprecipitate the supernatants for 15\u202fmin. After washing with TBS and boiling with sample buffer, the supernatants were used to western blotting. Na+/K\u202f+\u202f-ATPase was used as a loading control for cell surface proteins.Determination of ATM kinase activity by monitoring ADP formationHEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Flag-ATM, pcDNA3-Flag-GLUT1 WT or pcDNA3-Flag-GLUT1 S490A construct, respectively. The HEK293 cells transfected with GLUT1 were regularly cultured in 21% O2. The HEK293 cells transfected with ATM were cultured in the hypoxic condition combined with or without 5\u202f\u03bcM KU60019 treatment for 8\u202fh. Flag-ATM and Flag-Cortactin were immunopurified from the extracts with Anti-FLAG\u00ae M2 Magnetic Beads (M8823, Sigma). Kinase reactions were conducted by incubating purified ATM with purified GLUT1 WT or S490A in kinase reaction solution in a 96-well plate according to the protocol of Universal Kinase Assay Kit (Fluorometric) (abcam, ab138879). Then 20\u202f\u03bcl of ADP Sensor Buffer and 10\u202f\u03bcl of ADP Sensor were added into each well and the reaction mixture was incubated in dark at room temperature for 30\u202fmin. After reaction, the fluorescence intensity of ADP products was detected with a microplate fluorescence reader (BioTek, flx800) at Ex/Em\u202f=\u202f540/590\u202fnm. Proteins were immunoblotted with the antibodies to GLUT1 and p-GLUT1.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM)CAFs or the engineering CAFs (2.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f106) were seeded into a 6 well plate in growth medium. After removing the growth medium, DMEM (2\u202fml) with 0.5% FBS was added to further culture in hypoxia condition for 8\u202fh, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged to obtain conditioned medium.Cell migration and invasion assayCell migration and invasion were measured by Boyden chamber assay as described previously. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 or BT-549 cells (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f104) suspended in 200\u202f\u03bcl serum-free medium (CM or CM with exogenous lactate) were seeded into the wells of 8\u202f\u03bcm-pore Boyden chambers (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) coated with (for cell invasion assay) or without (for cell migration assay) ECM (1:7.5) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Medium with FBS was added into the lower chamber. Cells can invade toward medium in the lower chamber, and the invaded cells on the opposite side of the filter were stained with crystal violet in methanol and counted after incubation for 8\u202fh. All the experiments were repeated in three times.Measurement of glucose consumption, lactate productionThe glucose consumption and lactate production were measured using the Glucose Assay Kit and Lactate Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Briefly, 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 of NFs, CAFs, engineered CAFs (CAF/ecto-WT, CAF/ecto-S490A, CAF/sh-ATM, CAF/sh-PKM2, CAF/sh-MCT4, and CAF/sh-Ctrl) and their control cells were plated in 12-well plates. Cell culture and treatments in the experiments were described in detail in the figure legends. At the end of the experiments, the samples (supernatant or cell lysates) were prepared and glucose probe, glucose enzyme mix (for glucose assay) or lactate enzyme mix, lactate substrate mix (for lactate assay) were added to the samples. After incubating at room temperature for 30\u202fmin, the absorbance (OD 505\u202fnm for glucose assay) or optical density (OD 530\u202fnm for lactate assay) were measured with a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, Vermont, USA), separately. The glucose consumption and lactate production were normalized by cell numbers.Mitochondrial detection by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)NFs and CAFs were harvested and fixed in glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide for 2\u202fh at 4\u202f\u00b0C, separately. After being dehydrated in ethanol and acetone, the cells were embedded in epoxy resin and polymerized at 60\u202f\u00b0C. Ultrathin sections with the thickness of 60\u202fnm were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Slides were observed under TEM (Hitachi-7500, Japan) and photographed using a CCD camera (Gatan-780CCD, USA).Detection of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)The intracellular ROS levels of stromal fibroblasts were measured by Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit (S0033, Beyotime) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, CAFs were cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 8\u202fh with or without 1\u202fmM NAC. Then, 10\u202f\u03bcM of DCFH-DA was added to cells and incubated continually for 30\u202fmin. Total cell lysate was obtained by lysing with RIPA buffer (P0013B, Beyotime), and fluorescent compound was scanned at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535\u202fnm by using Cary Eclipse (Agilent) for determination.The measurements of OCR and ECARThe cellular OXPHOS and glycolysis were detected by monitoring the OCR (oxygen-consumption rate) and ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) with the Seahorse Bioscience Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience Inc.). Briefly, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f104 cells were seeded in 24-well plates matched for XF24. Before measurements, cells were washed and then incubated with unbuffered media in a CO2 free incubator for 45\u202fmin. The detection of OCR was performed in XF Base Media and the following inhibitors were added: oligomycin (2\u202f\u03bcM), carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (1.5\u202f\u03bcM) and rotenone/antimycin A (0.5\u202f\u03bcM/1\u202f\u03bcM). The detection of ECAR was performed in XF Base Media and the following inhibitors were added: Rotenone/Antimycin A (0.5\u202f\u03bcM/1\u202f\u03bcM) and 2-deoxy-glucose (20\u202fmM). Measuring OCR before and after addition of oligomycin, correlates to the mitochondrial respiration from ATP production, then the oligomycin-sensitive OCR (OxPhos OCR) was acquired. Measuring ECAR before and after addition of 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG), confirming the ECAR produced in the experiment is due to glycolysis, then the glycolytic ECAR was obtained. OCR and ECAR were normalized according to cell number (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f104).Detection of mitochondrial membrane potentialThe mitochondrial membrane potential of NFs and CAFs were measured using the JC-1 kit (C2006; Beyotime) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f106) were seeded and grow overnight, then stained with JC-1 dye, the mean orange-red fluorescence (FL-2 channel) were recorded and quantified by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences).Orthotopic xenografts and lung metastasis analysisAnimal experiments were authorized by the animal use committees of Chongqing Medical University. MDA-MB-231 cells (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f106) mixed with control CAFs (CAF/Ctrl) or engineered CAFs (1\u202f\u00d7\u202f106) in 200\u202f\u03bcl of PBS:Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio were subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old female nude mice. The two axes of tumor were assessed by caliper measurements every three days to calculate the tumor volume ((L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2)/2). When the tumor was around 50\u202fmm3, the mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 and CAF/sh-Ctrl were intraperitoneally administered with 2-DG (2-Deoxy-Glucose, Sigma, 500\u202fmg/kg, three times a week.) or CHC (\u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, Sigma, 25\u202f\u03bcmol in 200\u202f\u03bcl, daily); the mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and CAF/sh-ATM were intraperitoneally administered with lactate (Sigma, 100\u202f\u03bcmol in 200\u202f\u03bcl, daily). At the end of animal experiments, mouse lungs were serially sectioned into 5\u202f\u03bcm sections and prepared for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for subsequent blinded evaluation of metastases in the lungs.Ethics statementAnimal experiments were permitted by the animal use committees of Chongqing Medical University. All animal work was conducted in accordance with an approved protocol and carried out according to the institutional animal welfare guidelines of the Chongqing Medical University.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using SPSS 19.0 software. The results are shown as means \u00b1 SD. Multiple groups were analyzed using ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, and single comparison between two groups was analyzed using Student's t-test. A P-value <.05 was considered to be statistically significant.ResultsThere are an aberrant energy metabolism-associated gene expression profile and increased glycolytic activity in breast CAFs.Hypoxia stimulates the activation of DSB-independent oxidized ATM kinase to promote glycolysis in CAFs.Higher glycolysis phenotype in CAFs compared with NFs. a.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 1Our previous studies showed the different biological characteristics and global gene expression profiles between breast CAFs and NFs. Using bioinformatics analysis, we found a set of altered genes associated with energy metabolism in CAFs (Fig. 1a). CAFs and their paired NFs were isolated from breast tissue. CAFs was identified with fibronectin (FN), which is the biomarker of fibroblasts, and CAFs-selective biomarkers including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin(\u03b1 -SMA)and fibroblast activation protein(FAP)through Q-PCR (Fig. S1a). The expression changes of these biomarkers were reproved by western blotting in 3 paired of NFs and CAFs (Fig. S1b). FN was universally expressed in NFs and CAFs and the expression of \u03b1 -SMA was high in CAFs (Fig. S1c). These data demonstrated that the purified CAFs were successfully acquired from tumor tissue. Higher levels of PKM2 and LDHA were detected in CAFs by cDNA microarray and confirmed again by western blotting in another three pairs of NFs and CAFs (Fig. 1b). Some metabolism genes such as GLUT-3, HK2 and HPI were reported abnormal expressed in some cancer cells, these genes were also detected in in NFs and CAFs. As shown in Fig. 1b, the levels of GLUT-3, HK2 were very low in NFs and CAFs, although a litter bitter higher GLUT-3 and HK2 in CAFs compared to NFs, indicating that GLUT3 and HK2 are not the dominate factors in the glycolysis process of CAFs. The expression of HPI has no significant difference between CAFs and NFs, it was not considered as a differential gene. To experimentally test the glycolytic activity in CAFs, oxygen-consumption rate (OCR) from OxPhos and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) from glycolysis were examined using primary NFs and CAFs. Indeed, lower levels of OxPhos OCR (Fig. 1c) and higher levels of glycolytic ECAR (Fig. 1d) were detected in CAFs than in NFs. Furthermore, weaker mitochondrial membrane potentials were also detected in CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 1e). Consistently, less mitochondria (Fig. 1f, left panel) and reduced mitochondria crista (Fig. 1f, right panel) were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in CAFs than in NFs. To further investigate the glycolytic activities of CAFs, immortalized breast CAFs were cultured in different O2 concentrations for 3\u202fh. A hypoxia-dependent glycolysis was corroborated by testing glucose consumption and lactate generation (Fig. S2a). Similarly, a time-dependent glycolysis induced by hypoxia was also observed in CAFs (Fig. S2b). These data demonstrate the enhanced glycolysis is in breast CAFs.Hypoxia enhances glycolysis and hypoxia-induced activation of oxidized ATM in CAFs. a. CAFs were cultured in 1% O2 condition for designed time, western blots showing p-ATM (S1981), ATM, \u03b3-H2AX and CHK2 (T68) levels. \u03b2-Actin is the loading control. b. Western blots of p-ATM (S1981), ATM, \u03b3-H2AX and CHK2 (T68) levels in CAFs with different treatment (1% O2 for 0\u202fh, 1% O2 for 8\u202fh, 10\u202f\u03bcM of cisplatin for 4\u202fh). \u03b2-Actin is the loading control. c. CAFs were cultured under 21% O2 or 1% O2 for 8\u202fh with or without KU60019 treatment (5\u202f\u03bcM). Western blots show levels of p-ATM (S1981), ATM, and \u03b2-Actin in CAFs. Glucose consumption and lactate production were detected in same time (a, p\u202f<\u202f.05, normoxic CAF under KU60019 vs control CAF p\u202f<\u202f.01; b, p\u202f<\u202f.01, hypoxic CAFs vs normoxic CAFs; ##, p\u202f<\u202f.01, hypoxic CAFs under KU60019 vs hypoxic control CAFs. ANOVA). d. Western blots showing p-ATM (S1981) and ATM proteins in CAFs with three different shRNAs against ATM. Cellular glucose consumption and lactate production were determined in hypoxic CAFs with under depletion of ATM by specific shRNAs against ATM (**, P\u202f<\u202f.01, CAF/shATM vs CAF/shCtrl, Student's t-test). e. Five groups of primary CAFs were cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) for 8\u202fh, the glucose consumption and lactate generation were detected (*, p\u202f<\u202f.05, hypoxic CAFs vs normoxic CAFs, Student's t-test). f. Primary CAFs were cultured with or without KU60019 (5\u202f\u03bcM) under hypoxia (1% O2) for 8\u202fh, the glucose consumption and lactate generation were determined (*, p\u202f<\u202f.01, hypoxic CAFs with KU60019 vs hypoxic CAFs with DMSO, Student's t-test).Fig. 2Our previous study showed that aberrant ATM signaling may exist in CAFs. Using primary fibroblasts isolated from breast tumors, we detected higher levels of phosphorylated ATM in CAFs (Fig. S2c). The activation of ATM (p-ATM) could be stimulated by hypoxia and maintained at a high level with no DNA damage at 8\u202fh; and just a few of DNA damage appeared around 12 to 24\u202fh in hypoxia, which evaluated by \u03b3H2AX and CHK2 (T68) proteins, two of known biomarkers of double-strand break (DSB) (Fig. 2a) (CAFs were then cultured in hypoxia around 8\u202fh in subsequent experiments to avoid DSB), suggesting an DSB-independent ATM (or called oxidized ATM) activation in CAFs. In agreement with this result, the increased p-ATM was detected in cytoplasm rather than in nucleus by immunofluorescence staining in CAFs under hypoxia for 8\u202fh (Fig. S2d). However, cisplatin (a DSB-induced chemical drug) treatment resulted in an obvious DNA damage-dependent ATM activation with enhanced \u03b3H2AX and CHK2 (T68) in CAFs (Fig. 2b). Consistently, nuclear 53BP1 and \u03b3H2AX (biomarkers of DSBs) were also observed in CAFs treated with cisplatin rather than in hypoxic CAFs (Fig. S2e). These data demonstrated that oxidized ATM is activated in a DSBs-independent manner in hypoxic CAFs. To explore whether oxidized ATM acts as a redox sensor for hypoxia, CAFs were cultured in hypoxic conditions with or without antioxidant NAC for 8\u202fh, cellular ROS levels were measured by DCF fluorescence detection. Hypoxia treatment could significantly increase ROS levels in CAFs, which were mitigated by antioxidant NAC (Fig. S2f). Correspondingly, p-ATM protein levels were enhanced in hypoxic condition but diminished by NAC, with no influence on the total ATM protein in CAFs (Fig. S2g), indicating that ATM protein may be oxidized and activated by ROS under hypoxia.GLUT1 is a phosphorylated target of oxidized ATM kinase in CAFs.Accumulating evidence suggests that ATM has been involved in energy metabolism. Next, we tested whether the oxidized ATM kinase contributes to glycolytic activity in CAFs. It was found that hypoxia-enhanced glucose consumption and lactate products were decreased by antioxidant NAC (Fig. S1h). To directly explore the effect of oxidized ATM on glycolysis in breast CAFs, an ATM specific inhibitor KU60019 was used. As expected, levels of p-ATM (s1981) were pronouncedly increased in hypoxic CAFs and apparently decreased in the presence of KU60019 (Fig. 2c left panel). Glycolytic activity was also significantly impaired by the ATM inhibitor KU60019 in hypoxic CAFs (Fig. 2c, middle and right panel). Knockdown of ATM in CAFs (Fig. 2d, left panel) led to a notably reduced glycolysis (Fig. 2d, middle and right panel). The enhanced glucose consumption and lactate generation were also detected in another 5 of primary hypoxic CAFs isolated from breast tumor tissues (Fig. 2e), and attenuated by KU60019 treatment (Fig. 2f). These data indicate that oxidized ATM promotes glycolytic activity in hypoxic breast CAFs.To understand the potential mechanisms of oxidized ATM in promoting glycolysis of hypoxic CAFs, quantitative phosphoproteome analysis was performed using high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis. 1294 differential phosphosites in 615 proteins were identified in hypoxic CAFs, among which 113 sites in 33 proteins contains SQ or TQ motif, the potential phosphosites of oxidized ATM kinase (Supplemental Table 2). There are seven phosphorylated proteins involved in energy metabolism in hypoxic CAFs (Supplemental Table 3).Oxidized ATM induces phosphorylated GLUT1 translocation to cellular membrane and PKM2 up-regulation in CAFs.GLUT1 is a phosphorylated target of oxidized ATM kinase. a. The phosphorylated serine 490 residue in GLUT1 was identified by LC-MS/MS. b. The conserved consensus of ATM phosphorylation site in GLUT1 (Serine 490) of human and other species. c. Cell lysate from CAFs treated with or without KU60019 (labeled with KU) and ATM knocked down-CAFs were immunoprecipitated, the phosphorylated GLUT1 was detected. Protein levels of p-ATM and ATM in cell extracts were detected by western blotting. d. HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Flag-ATM or pcDNA3-Flag-GLUT1 WT or mutant (S490A) construct, respectively. Cells with pcDNA3-Flag-ATM were cultured under hypoxia with or without KU60019 (5\u202f\u03bcM). In vitro kinase assay was performed using purified ATM kinase mixed with substrates of purified GLUT1. The ADP products (d) and the phosphorylated GLUT1 (e) are shown.Fig. 3GLUT1, essential for glucose uptake in cells, is one of significantly changed phospho-protein in the phosphoproteome of CAFs. Serine 490 in the (S/T)Q context of GLUT1 was identified as an ATM-specific phosphorylation site by LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 3a), which is a highly conserved consensus sequence across human, mouse, rat, sheep and chickens (Fig. 3b). Using immunoprecipitation with an antibody specifically recognizing the ATM/ATR substrate of p(S/T-Q) followed by western blotting with antibody against GLUT1 in the immunoprecitated proteins, we detected a decreased signal of endogenous phosphorylated GLUT1 in response to ATM inhibition and ATM knockdown in hypoxic CAFs (Fig. 3c). A phospho-specific antibody against GLUT1 S490 (pGLUT1 S490) was further used to detect p-GLUT1 in CAFs. As shown in Fig. S3a, the phosphorylated GLUT1 at S490 was significantly induced by hypoxia, then attenuated by KU60019 treatment in CAFs. Similar results were acquired using primary CAFs at the same condition (Fig. S3b). After transfection of ectopic wild-type (WT) or mutant GLUT1 (S490A) into the endogenous GLUT1-silenced CAFs (CAF/Glut1 KD) (Fig. S3c), enhanced phosphorylated-GLUT1 was detected in hypoxic CAF/ecto-Glut1 WT rather than in hypoxic CAF/ecto-Glut1 S490A (Fig. S3d), indicating GLUT1 is specifically phosphorylated at S490 by hypoxia. To further verify the role of oxidized ATM to phosphorylate GLUT1 at serine 490, in vitro ATM kinase assay was carried out. Oxidized ATM could phosphorylate wild-type GLUT1 but not mutant GLUT1 (S490A) under hypoxia detected by Fluorimetric Kinase Assay (Fig. 3d) and immunoblotting with antibody against phosphorylated GLUT1 (Fig. 3e). Notably, KU60019 abolished the GLUT1 phosphorylation by oxidized ATM (Fig. 3d-3e), supporting a critical role of oxidized ATM in directly phosphorylating GLUT1 in hypoxic breast CAFs.ATM promotes GLUT1 translocation and PKM2 activation in CAFs. a. CAFs were cultured in normoxia or hypoxia for 8\u202fh and treated with or without KU60019 (5\u202f\u03bcM), the membrane GLUT1 was shown by immunofluorescence staining. Scale bar, 50\u202f\u03bcm. b. The engineered CAFs (CAF/ecto-WT and CAF/ecto-S490A) (as described at material and methods) were cultured in normoxic or hypoxic condition for 8\u202fh and treated with or without KU60019 (5\u202f\u03bcM), the membrane location of GLUT1 in CAFs was detected by immunofluorescence staining. Scale bar, 50\u202f\u03bcm. c. Glucose consumption and lactate production of CAFs described in (b) and their parent CAFs were detected. (a, p\u202f<\u202f.01, normoxic CAF/ecto-S490A vs normoxic CAF/ecto-WT under DMSO treatment; b, p\u202f<\u202f.01, hypoxic CAF/ecto-WT vs normoxic CAF/ecto-WT; c, p\u202f>\u202f.05, hypoxic CAF/ecto-S490A vs normoxic CAF/ecto-S490A; d, p\u202f<\u202f.01, hypoxic CAF/ecto-WT under KU60019 vs DMSO. ANOVA). d. CAFs were cultured in normoxia or hypoxia for 8\u202fh and treated with or without KU60019 (5\u202f\u03bcM), protein levels of p-ATM, ATM, p-AKT, AKT and PKM2 were determined by Western blotting. e. Western blotting was used to measure the expressions of p-ATM, ATM, p-AKT, AKT and PKM2 in control CAFs (CAF/sh-NC) and CAFs with shRNAs targeting ATM (CAFs/shATM#1 and CAFs/shATM#2) under hypoxic condition. \u03b2-Actin is the loading control in (D) and (E). f. Immunofluorescence staining of PKM2 in CAFs as described in (e). DAPI is specifically dyed for nucleus. Scale bar, 100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4To understand whether phosphorylation of GLUT1 can lead to cell membrane translocation of GLUT1, cellular membrane GLUT1 in CAFs were evaluated. Using IF staining, we found more membrane GLUT1 in hypoxic CAFs than in normoxic CAFs (Fig. 4a). ATM inhibitor KU60019 treatment blocked GLUT1 translocation to cell membrane, leading to a cytoplasm accumulation of GLUT1 (Fig. 4a). Using biotin pull-down of surface proteins for immunoblotting detection, we verified that membrane GLUT1 was increased in hypoxic CAFs and KU60019 could decrease GLUT1 translocation to cell membrane (Fig. S3e). We also found that membrane GLUT1 was increased in primary CAFs under hypoxia by using biotin pull-down of surface proteins for immunoblotting detection and the translocation to membrane were blocked with the KU60019 treatment as shown in Fig. S3f. To further confirm whether the phosphorylation of ATM specific (S/T-Q) site in GLUT1 (S490) mediated the cell membrane translocation of GLUT1, engineered CAFs with ectopic wild type (CAF/ecto-WT) and mutant GLUT1 S490A (CAF/ecto-S490A) were established and used in experiments. Hypoxia could stimulate endogenous GLUT1 (Fig. 4a) and ectopic wild-type GLUT1 (Fig. 4b, middle left panel; and Fig. S3g), no mutant GLUT1 S490A (Fig. 4B, middle right panel; Fig. S3g) translocated to cell membrane. KU60019 treatment abolished GLUT1 translocation to cell membrane (Fig. 4b, down panel), suggesting phosphorylation of serine 490 is essential for GLUT1 membrane translocation. Accordingly, membrane translocation of wild type GLUT1, rather than mutant GLUT1 S490A, caused higher glucose consumption and lactate generation in CAFs, which could be reduced by KU60019 (Fig. 4c). In addition, mutant GLUT1 S490A did not translocate to cell membrane in CAFs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and had no effects on glycolytic alteration in CAFs (Fig. 4c). These data indicate that oxidized ATM induces phosphorylation and translocation of GLUT1 in CAFs, thereby increased glycolytic activity of CAFs.Increased glycolytic activity in CAFs fuels breast cancer cell invasion through lactate.PKM2 plays a pivotal role in cellular glycolysis. As aforementioned, enhanced PKM2 existed in CAFs compared with NFs (see Fig. 1a). To understand whether oxidized ATM could also up-regulate PKM2 expression, we detected PKM2 protein levels in immortalized CAFs and primary CAFs by western blotting. As expected, high levels of PKM2 proteins were detected in hypoxic CAFs than in normoxic CAFs, which was associated with activated AKT (Fig. 4d, and Fig. S3h). Blockage of oxidized ATM activation using KU60019 resulted in decrease of phosphorylated AKT and PKM2 protein levels (Fig. 4d, and Fig. S3h). PKM2 and p-AKT proteins were also reduced by ATM knockdown in hypoxic CAFs (Fig. 4e and f), suggesting that oxidized ATM and its downstream PI3K-AKT signaling regulate PKM2 expression. These date demonstrate that oxidized ATM-mediated cell membrane translocation of phosphorylated GLUT1 and high level of PKM2 in CAFs are critical for glycolysis change in response to hypoxia.CAFs enhance migration and invasion of breast cancer cells through glycolysis. a. Breast cancer cells BT549 and MDA-MB-231 (or labeled as MB-231) were cocultured with CM from control CAFs (CAFs/sh-Ctrl) or ATM-silenced CAFs (CAFs/sh-ATM). Cellular migration ability was detected by Transwell assay (without ECM coated). The average migrated cells were showed by histograms (*, P\u202f<\u202f.01, Student's t-test). b-e. Breast cancer cells of BT549 and MDA-MB-231 (or labeled as MB-231) were seeded into the Boyden chambers (coated with ECM) and co-cultured with CM from different hypoxic CAFs, cell invasion abilities were measured. b. Breast cancer cells were mixed with CM from ATM-knocked down or control CAFs. c. Breast cancer cells were co-cultured with CM from hypoxic CAF/sh-ATM added with or without exogenous lactate (20\u202fmM). d. Breast cancer cells were mixed with CM from the hypoxic CAFs transfected with specific shRNA against MCT4 or control shRNA. e. Breast cancer cells transfected with specific shRNA against MCT1 or control shRNA were cultured in the CM from hypoxic CAFs. The histograms show the average invaded cells each view (*, P\u202f<\u202f.01, Student's t-test). Scale bar, 100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 5The previous studies unraveled that CAFs can promote cancer cell migration and invasion through secreting proteins and extracellular matrix remodeling. We asked whether oxidized ATM-induced glycolysis enhancement in CAFs has an effect on breast tumor cell invasion. Interestingly, breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, co-cultured with CM from ATM-knocked down CAFs (CAF/sh-ATM) had a reduced migration (Fig. 5a) or invasion (Fig. 5b) ability in comparison with breast cancer cells co-cultured with CM from control CAFs (CAF/sh-Ctrl). Exogenous lactate added into the supernatant from ATM-silenced CAFs (CAF/sh-ATM) effectively rescued the invasion abilities of breast cancer cells (Fig. 5c). Subsequently, we wondered whether membrane translocation of phosphorylated GLUT1 or PKM2 upregulation-mediated lactate generation in hypoxic CAFs directly contribute to breast tumor cell invasion. Indeed, CM from hypoxic CAF/ecto-S490A hampered the invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells in contrast to CM from hypoxic CAF/ecto-WT (Fig. S4a). Similar data were acquired from PKM2 wild-type and PKM2-knocked down CAFs, in which loss of PKM2 led to lactate decrease(Fig. S4b) and reduced breast tumor cell invasion (Fig. S4c).Lactate derived from hypoxic CAFs promotes cancer cell invasion by triggering TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling and increasing mitochondrial activity.To further confirm these findings, MCT4 (the main exporter of lactate in stromal fibroblasts) or MCT1 (the key monocarboxylate transporter for uptake of lactate into tumor cells) was knocked down by shRNA in CAFs or in tumor cells, respectively. As expected, knockdown of MCT4 in hypoxic CAFs led to reduced lactate in supernatant (Fig. S4d), thus decreased tumor cell invasion in the co-culture system (Fig. 5d); Loss of MCT1 in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells decreased lactate uptake from CM of hypoxic CAFs (Fig. S4e) and yielded an attenuated tumor cell invasion (Fig. 5e). Taken together, these data suggest that oxidized ATM-mediated glycolysis enhancement in CAFs facilitates tumor cell invasion through lactate from fibroblasts.Lactate derived from CAFs activates TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling in breast cancer cells. a. The indicated breast cancer cells co-cultured with supernatant derived from control CAFs (CAFs/sh-Ctrl) or ATM-silenced CAFs (CAFs/sh-ATM), protein levels of TGF-\u03b21, total P38, p-P38, MMP2, and MMP9 in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were determined by Western blotting. b. CM from ATM-silenced CAFs (CAF/sh-ATM) with or without exogenous lactate (20\u202fmM) was used to culture with breast cancer cells, the expressions of TGF\u03b21, P38, p-P38, MMP2, and MMP9 in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were detected by Western blotting. c-d. Expressions of TGF\u03b21, P38, p-P38, MMP2 and MMP9 in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were determined by Western blotting under co-culture with CM from the endogenous GLUT1 silenced CAFs re-transfected with WT (CAF/WT), or mutant GLUT1 S490A (CAF/S490A) (c); CAFs transfected with control shRNA (CAF/sh-Ctrl) or sh-PKM2 (CAF/sh-PKM2) (d).e. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 were co-cultured with supernatant from CAFs transfected with control shRNA or specific shRNA against MCT4. The expressions of TGF\u03b21, P38, p-P38, MMP2, and MMP9 were determined using Western blotting. f. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells transfected with control shRNA or specific shRNA against MCT1 were co-cultured with supernatant from CAF. Western blotting was done to detect the expressions of TGF\u03b21, P38, p-P38, MMP2, and MMP9 in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control for Western blotting assay. The histograms of densitometric analysis were shown accompanied with western blots respectively (*, P\u202f<\u202f.05, Student's t-test).Fig. 6It has been reported that lactate can activate signaling cascades, such as TGF\u03b22 signaling in glioma, indicating lactate works as an energy metabolic coupling between CAFs and tumor cells to trigger downstream pathways in fueling tumor cell invasion. Of note, high levels of TGF\u03b21, phosphorylated P38 (p-P38), MMP2, and MMP9 were detected in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells co-cultured with CM from hypoxic CAFs, and knockdown of ATM by specific shRNA decreased these protein levels (Fig. 6a), indicating CM from hypoxic CAFs could stimulate TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 breast cancer cells. Addition of lactate to MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells increased the activation of TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling (Fig. 6b). Co-culture of tumor cells in CM from CAFs/ecto-S490A resulted in reduced TGF\u03b21, p-P38, MMP2 and MMP9 proteins in tumor cells (Fig. 6c). In line with these findings, the protein levels in tumor cells were decreased by the CM from CAFs/sh-PKM2 (Fig. 6d). Furthermore, silencing MCT4 in hypoxic CAFs (Fig. 6e) or knockdown of MCT1 in tumor cells (Fig. 6f), which blocks lactate transport into tumor cells, led to attenuated activation of this signaling cascade. These data reveal a lactate-dependent TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling axis involved in breast tumor cell invasion.Oxidized ATM-mediated lactate accumulation through glycolysis in CAFs promotes breast tumor metastasis in vivo.On the other hand, lactate can serve as an energy supply to fuel mitochondria metabolism. Indeed, co-culture of breast tumor cells MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 with CM from ATM-knocked down CAFs (CAF/sh-ATM), the OxPhos OCR in tumor cells were reduced (Fig. S5a). Supplementation of exogenous lactate (20\u202fmM) in the CM from CAF/sh-ATM could rescue mitochondrial activities of tumor cells (Fig. S5b), indicating that hypoxic CAFs-derived lactate activates mitochondrial activity in tumor cells. To confirm whether the enhanced mitochondrial activity stimulated by hypoxic CAFs-derived lactate was associated with cancer cell invasion, oligomycin, an anti-mitochondrial drug reported in previous study was used in our experiments. After the treatment of oligomycin, the reduced mitochondrial activity in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were reflected by declined OxPhos OCR (Fig. S5c, Fig. S5e), and the invasion ability of cancer cells was decreased correspondingly (Fig. S5d, Fig. S5f). In summary, theses data show that hypoxic CAFs-derived lactate may also accelerate cancer cell invasion through fueling mitochondrial activity of tumor cells.ATM-induced glycolysis is required for CAF-facilitated mammary tumor metastasis in mice.Breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 mixed with the CAFs or engineered CAFs (CAF/sh-ATM, CAF/sh-MCT4) were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice.

Compared with the tumor burden mice injected with mixture of MDA-MB-231 and control CAFs, the tumor burden mice which injected with MDA-MB-231 and engineered CAFs (CAF/sh-ATM, CAF/sh-MCT4) had a significant small tumor (Fig. 7a; Fig. S6a-S6b) and fewer lung metastases (Fig. 7b, and Fig. S6c-S6d); application of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, a non-metabolized glucose analogue) or CHC (CAF/sh-Ctrl/CHC) to the tumor burden mice, injected with MDA-MB-231 and control CAFs, also decreased tumor growth (Fig. 7a; Fig. S6a-S6b) and correspondingly reduced metastases in mice lung tissues (Fig. 7b; Fig. S6c-S6d). In contrast, supplementation of exogenous lactate to the mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and ATM-knocked down CAFs (CAF/sh-ATM) could partially rescue tumor growth or metastasis (Fig. 7a-7b, and Fig. S6c-S6d). Blockage of glycolysis or inhibition of the lactate coupling between CAFs and tumor cells led to reduction of TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK signaling (Fig. 7c), thus decreased MMP2, MMP9 and TGF\u03b21 expressions (Fig. 7c-7d and Fig. S6e). Administrating the mice injected with MDA-MB-231 and ATM-knocked down CAFs using exogenous lactate could partially rescue the TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK signaling, and increased MMP2, MMP9 and TGF\u03b21 levels in tumor tissues (Fig. 7c-7d, and Fig. S6e). These data support that oxidized ATM-mediated glycolysis in CAFs can promote breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis through lactate transfer between CAFs and cancer cells.DiscussionOxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) is the predominant ATP supplier and supports tumor growth in several cancer cell types. However, hypoxia is one of typical features in tumor tissues because of accelerated proliferation and poorly angiogenesis. Hypoxia exerts a profound influence on tumor biology and regulates the hallmarks of cancer cells (such as stemness, metabolic reprogramming, resistance to anticancer therapies). Besides, hypoxia is highly related with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. In our previous study, we found hypoxia can enhance the proliferation of breast CAFs. To survive in hypoxic condition, the cells in tumor tissues tend to glycolysis more than pyruvate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. In this study, we reveal a crucial mechanism underlying the oxidized ATM-induced glycolysis alterations in stromal CAFs. Compared with NFs, the oxidized ATM protein is enhanced in breast CAFs, companied with lower OCR and higher ECAR. In addition, weaker mitochondrial membrane potential and less mitochondrial were detected in CAFs. Hypoxia-stimulated oxidized ATM promotes the glycolysis phenotype in a DSB-independent manner in CAFs. Metabolites lactate derived from CAFs act as a metabolic coupling link between CAFs and breast tumor cells to trigger the downstream TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling and increase mitochondrial activity in tumor cells, thus fueling tumor cell invasion. Our works demonstrate that the oxidized ATM plays a key role in glycolysis process in breast CAFs and promotes tumor invasion through lactate-mediated metabolic coupling.Oxidized ATM exists in breast CAFs compared to NFs. Traditionally, ATM has been activated via DSBs and performs the DSB repair response through phosphorylating downstream substrates such as \u03b3H2AX, a biomarker of the DSB-dependent ATM activation. Recently, some of evidence suggests that ATM protein kinase can be enabled directly by oxidative stress in cytoplasm, which is independence of the canonical DSB-induced ATM activation mechanism. Generally, the cellular ROS levels, which are closely associated with hypoxia, are important to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. The high levels of cellular ROS can stimulate auto-phosphorylation of ATM at Ser1981, a hallmark of the activation of the oxidized ATM kinase. Application of NAC (antioxidant) to CAFs specifically decrease the ROS amount and reduce the p-ATM (s1981) protein levels in CAFs, indicating that the oxidized ATM kinase may be activated by ROS in hypoxic breast CAFs.Oxidized ATM can promote glycolysis in breast CAFs. A growing number of studies have provided converging evidence for oxidized ATM in the absence of DSBs participating in other cell biological process. For example, oxidized ATM phosphorylates distinct substrates such as HIF1\u03b1 at Ser696, leading to the specific activation of HIF1\u03b1 signaling. The oxidized ATM plays a critical role in breast CAF cell proliferation by activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways. In addition, oxidized ATM promotes cell glucose absorption in muscle cells, indicating that oxidized ATM is a regulator of cellular energy metabolism. GLUT1 has been found to take charge in the Warburg effect in some human tumor cells. Especially, the carboxy terminal of GLUT1 plays key roles in the biological function of GLUT1. We showed that hypoxia-induced oxidized ATM plays a positive role in the glycolysis enhancement of breast CAFs by directly phosphorylating GLUT1 at Ser490, the specific ATM-phosphorylated (S/T)Q motif which locates at the C-terminal of GLUT1, and up-regulating PKM2 expression through PI3K/AKT signaling. Here, phosphorylation of GLUT1 at Ser490 by the oxidized ATM results in the translocation of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane and is responsible for the increased glucose uptake in CAFs. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia-induced ATM protein kinase plays a direct role in GLUT1 phosphorylation and plasma membrane translocation, thus promoting the glycolysis enhancement in CAFs. In addition, oxidized ATM also up-regulating PKM2 expression through PI3K/AKT signaling. PKM2 promotes pyruvate production and ATP generation in the glycolytic pathway. For example, PKM2 expression contributes to aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells for tumor growth. In vitro, overexpression of Twist in breast cancer cells results in Warburg effect through elevation of PKM2 via activating integrin \u03b21-FAK-PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis. Here, we show that the expression of PKM2 is enhanced by oxidized ATM via PI3K/AKT signaling and contributes to glycolysis of breast CAFs under hypoxia. Thus, our works demonstrate that oxidized ATM in hypoxic CAFs can induce the robust glycolytic activity through phosphorylating GLUT1 and PI3K/AKT-dependent PKM2 up-regulation.Furthermore, we unravel that metabolites lactate from CAFs acts as metabolic coupling between CAFs and tumor cells to stimulate up-regulation of MMP2 and MMP9 and motivate the mitochondrial activity to fuel tumor cell invasion. Recently, it has been reported that tumor cells in microenvironment function as metabolic parasites to take up energy (such as L-lactate, ketones, and glutamine, free fatty acids) from surrounding host cells (e.g. fibroblasts and adipocytes) to increase their ability for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), thus driving tumor cell proliferation, apoptotic resistance and drug resistance. We found that the metabolism coupling boosts tumor invasion via lactate shuttle from CAFs, and the lactate from CAFs can be used for the enhanced mitochondrial activity in breast cancer cells. It has been shown that lactate, the product of glycolysis, has significant effects on tumor angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, tumor immune escape and self-sufficient metabolism. However, only a few of studies have identified the key elements or specific signaling of lactate-induced tumor cell biological behavior alteration. For instance, the metabolic intermediate lactate could act as a signaling molecule activator to the autocrine NF-\u03baB/IL-8 pathway to promote angiogenesis in tumors. Angiogenesis can also be promoted directly by lactate engaging three RTKs signaling in cancer. Our data demonstrate that the CAF-derived lactate stimulates TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK-dependent up-regulation of MMP2 and MMP9, thus contributing to tumor cell invasion.In conclusion, oxidized ATM-mediated enhanced glycolysis in breast CAFs. The oxidization and activation of ATM in hypoxia can promote both GLUT1-phosphorylation and PKM2 up-regulation to facilitate lactate production. Lactate, as a metabolic coupling mediator between CAFs (released by MCT4) and tumor cells (absorbed via MCT1), promotes tumor cell invasion through activation of TGF\u03b21/p38 MAPK/MMP2/9 signaling and fueling the mitochondrial activity in tumor cells. Thus, our work highlights a novel mechanism by which stromal fibroblasts fuel tumor invasion and may implicate a new strategy for breast cancer therapy.FundingThis work was supported in part by  (NSFC 81472476, NSFC 31171336, NSFC 31671481, NSFC 81072147) for Manran Liu.

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay.

(B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0028. (C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT).

(B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

Data are shown as relative expression of the miRNAs. Standard deviations were calculated on technical duplicates. The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008). (C) Histograms of qRT-PCR results showing the basal expression levels of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 in NFs compared with CAFs. Data are shown as relative expression of miRNAs folded on NFs. Standard deviations were calculated with replicates from two independent experiments performed on four different primary NF cells (pt. #1, #2, #3, and #4) and four different primary CAF cells (pt. #81, #82, #87, and #89). The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027). (D) Representative images of the EXOmotif analysis with MDS software showing a short motif (3\u20135 nt) in miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 sequences, predictive of their active loading into exosomes.

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0049. (E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "title": "Inhibition of experimental metastasis of human breast-carcinoma cells in athymic nude-mice by anti-alpha(5)beta(1) fibronectin receptor integrin antibodies.",
        "content": "We have investigated the role of the human alpha(5) beta(1) fibronectin receptor integrin in experimental metastasis. Treatment of human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells with monoclonal antibodies specific for alpha(5) or beta(1) integrin subunits prior to injection into the tail veins of 7 to 9 week old athymic nude mice significantly decreased the median number of lung colonies that were formed. In contrast, treatment of the cells with monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha(2) subunit had no significant effect. In vitro, the anti-alpha(5) and the anti-beta(1) monoclonal antibodies both strongly inhibited breast carcinoma cell adhesion to fibronectin, while only the anti-beta(1) monoclonal antibody inhibited adhesion to laminin. In a Boyden chamber invasion assay, the anti-beta(1) antibody almost completely inhibited invasion of the breast carcinoma cells through an artificial Matrigel basement membrane. The anti-alpha(5) monoclonal antibody inhibited in vitro invasion approximately 30%, only if fibroblast conditioned medium was present as a chemoattractant. Cell migration on fibronectin could be inhibited by both the anti-alpha(5) and the anti-beta(1) monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that the alpha(5) beta(1) integrin fibronectin receptor on MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells plays an important role in experimental hematogenous metastasis and may function in this process by a combination of mechanisms, including tumor cell attachment to fibronectin and fibronectin-directed extravasation of tumor cells into the target organ.",

        "title": "PO-12 - The key role of talin-1 in cancer cell extravasation dissected through human vascularized 3D microfluidic model.",
        "content": "Metastases are responsible for more than 90% of cancer related mortality. The hematogenous metastatic invasion is a complex process in which the endothelium plays a key role. Extravasation is a dynamic process involving remodeling and change in cell shape and in cytoskeleton whereby a series of strongly dependent interactions between CTCs and endothelium occurs [1]. Talins are proteins regulating focal adhesions and cytoskeleton remodeling. Talin-1 seems to be involved in the aggressiveness, motility, survival and invadopodia formation of cancer cells throughout the entire metastatic cascade [2], being up-regulated in breast cancer cells and mutated in sarcomas. Understand the implication of talin-1 in extravasation could facilitate the design of new therapies and finally fight cancer. We hypothesized that Talin-1 could be specifically involved in extravasation driving each of its steps. We developed a human 3D microfluidic model that enables the study of human cancer cell extravasation within a perfusable human microvascularized organ specific environment[3]. For the study of extravasation we applied microfluidic approach through the development of a microfluidic device in which endothelial cells and fibroblasts generated a 3D human functional vascular networks. Microvessel characterization was performed with immunofluorescence and permeability assays. We knocked-down talin-1 in triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 and metastatic fibro-sarcoma cell line HT1080 with SiRNA and verified by Western-blot. Cancer cells were then perfused in the vessels and extravasation monitored through confocal imaging. We developed a human vascularized 3D microfluidic device with human perfusable capillary-like structures embedded in fibrin matrix, characterized by mature endothelium markers and physiological permeability (1.5\u00b10.76)\u00d710(-6) cm/s. We focused on the role of Talin-1 in adhesion to endothelium, trans-endothelial migration (TEM) and early invasion. Adhesion to the endothelium, TEM and migration within the ECM were monitored through confocal analyses. We demonstrated that Talin-1 KD significantly reduced the adhesion efficiency and TEM in both cell lines. Early invasion was also strongly and statistically reduced by the SiRNA treatment in both cell lines. We proved Talin-1 function in driving the extravasation mechanism in a human 3D vascularized environment. We demonstrated that Talin-1 is involved in each part of extravasation significantly affecting adhesion, TEM and the invasion stages. Targeting this protein could thus be an effective strategy to block metastasis.",

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and lacks specific targeted therapeutic agents. The current mechanistic evidence from cell-based studies suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor-promoting role in TNBC; however, data on the clinical relevance of SPARC expression/secretion by tumor and stromal cells in TNBC are limited. Here, we analyzed by immunohistochemistry the prognostic value of tumor and stromal cell SPARC expression in 148 patients with non-metastatic TNBC and long follow-up (median: 5.4\u2009years). We also quantified PD-L1 and PD-1 expression. We detected SPARC expression in tumor cells (42.4%), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs; 88.1%), tumor-associated macrophages (77.1%), endothelial cells (75.2%) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (9.8%). Recurrence-free survival was significantly lower in patients with SPARC-expressing CAFs. Multivariate analysis showed that SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor. We also detected tumor and stromal cell SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, and in patient-derived xenografts and cell lines. Furthermore, we analyzed publicly available single-cell mRNA sequencing data and found that in TNBC, SPARC is expressed by different CAF subpopulations, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory fibroblasts that are involved in tumor-related processes. We then showed that fibroblast-secreted SPARC had a tumor-promoting role by inhibiting TNBC cell adhesion and stimulating their motility and invasiveness. Overall, our study demonstrates that SPARC expression in CAFs is an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome in TNBC.

SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion.

Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in modulating the progression of many solid tumors such as breast cancer (BC). Herein, we identify an integrin \u03b111/PDGFR\u03b2+ CAF subset displaying tumor-promoting features in BC. In the preclinical MMTV-PyMT mouse model, integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to a drastic reduction of tumor progression and metastasis. A clear association between integrin \u03b111 and PDGFR\u03b2 was found at both transcriptional and histological levels in BC specimens. High stromal integrin \u03b111/PDGFR\u03b2 expression was associated with high grades and poorer clinical outcome in human BC patients. Functional assays using five CAF subpopulations (one murine, four human) revealed that integrin \u03b111 promotes CAF invasion and CAF-induced tumor cell invasion upon PDGF-BB stimulation. Mechanistically, integrin \u03b111 pro-invasive activity relies on its ability to interact with PDGFR\u03b2 in a ligand-dependent manner and to promote its downstream JNK activation, leading to the production of tenascin C, a pro-invasive matricellular protein. Pharmacological inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 and JNK impaired tumor cell invasion induced by integrin \u03b111-positive CAFs. Collectively, our study uncovers an integrin \u03b111-positive subset of pro-tumoral CAFs that exploits PDGFR\u03b2/JNK signalling axis to promote tumor invasiveness in BC.",

Tumorigenesis is a complex process and consists of activating invasion and metastasis, inducing angiogenesis, avoiding immune destruction, and so on. These features required cooperation among various cellular and non-cellular elements of tumors which are known as tumor microenvironment (TME). The cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune and inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, bone marrow derived cells, capillaries, basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding the cancer cells constitute the tumor microenvironment. The study of fibroblasts has grown significantly since late nineteenth century. Fibroblasts associated with cancer are activated and have been termed as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Activated fibroblasts may gain further secretory phenotypes, specialized ECM remodeling ability, autocrine activation and dynamic immunomodulatory signaling functions. This process is associated with continuous injurious stimuli, such as the development of cancer lesions.Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) are key mediators of fibroblast activation in cancer development. TGF-\u03b2 can recruit and activate fibroblasts in many cancers. Proliferation and invasion of local cancer cells and CAFs are stimulated by TGF-\u03b2 in tumor microenvironment. The TGF-\u03b2 pathway is a paradigm of membrane to nucleus signaling by receptor-mediated activation of transcription factors. Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) is a member of pleiotropic ligand family which depends on serine/threonine kinase receptors to form heteromeric complexes composed of two ligand binding receptors (TGF-\u03b2RII) and two recruited receptors (TGF-\u03b2RI). Upon ligand engagement, TGF-\u03b2RII transphosphorylates and activates the kinase activity of TGF-\u03b2RI resulting in phosphorylation and mobilization of the transcriptional effectors against SMAD proteins. Acting through the SMAD-2/3 axis, TGF-\u03b21 drives the expression of key ECM genes, which are crucial components of developing fibrotic tissue, including collagens, fibronectin and PAI-1. TGF-\u03b21 becomes concentrated in the accumulating ECM, thereby exacerbating the fibrotic response.Artemisinin (ART) is a chemical isolated from the Sweet wormwood (qinhao, Artemisia annua L., Asteraceae) in 1972 by Youyou Tu at the Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The unique chemical structure of artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone with potent anti-malarial activity. In recent years, by inserting new groups to the parent structure of artemisinin, a series of artemisinin derivatives were synthesized and proved to possess better bioactivity or solubility, including artemether (ARM), artesunate (ARS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Artemisinin and its derivatives are currently considered as the most effective drug in treating cerebral malaria and chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria. Studies over the past two decades have provided important information on the anti-cancer activity of artemisinin and its derivatives, indicating that this class of compounds may also be effective cancer therapeutic drugs.However, the mechanism of ART, ARM, ARS and DHA in inhibiting cancer metastasis remained unclear, and whether inactivation of CAFs reduced cancer progression and metastasis are still unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of artemisinin and its derivatives on inactivation of cancer-associated fibroblasts. The results showed that ARS and DHA reverted CAFs from activated to inactivated state through suppressing TGF-\u03b2 pathway, and inhibited cancer growth and metastasis. It suggested that the inactivation of CAFs by artemisinin and its derivatives leads to a decreased interaction between tumor and its ECM, and maybe a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.Materials and methodsReagentsDimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

L-929-CAFs were treated with 50\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA, CAFs were treated with 30\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA. Then, CCK-8 solution was added to the medium and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for additional 4\u2009h. The absorbance was measured at 450\u2009nm.Western blotCells were harvested after pretreatment of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA for 24\u2009h. Western blot was performed as previously described. The membrane was blocked with 3% no fat milk in PBST at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h and incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, and then with HRP Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) or HRP Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) secondary antibody for 1\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The samples were visualized with High-sig ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Tanon, Shanghai, China) and Fully Automatic Chemiluminescence Image Analysis System (Tanon, Shanghai, China).ImmunofluorescenceCells were exposed to ART, ARM, ARS or DHA for 24\u2009h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C before being washed with PBS twice. L-929-CAFs were treated with 50\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA, CAFs were treated with 30\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30\u2009min, permeabilized for 15\u2009min in 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice, and blocked with 3% BSA for 2\u2009h. Then the cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After washed with PBS for three times, cells were exposed to Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H\u2009+\u2009L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibodies (Thermo, Waltham, USA) for 1\u2009h. Then cells were washed with PBS for three times and stained with ProLong\u2122 Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI. Finally, the slides were photographed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).Cytokines detection by ELISAThe concentration of cytokines in supernatant was detected by Mouse TGF-beta 1 ELISA kit (ABclonal, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The absorbance was measured at 450\u2009nm.Cell directional migration assayTranswell chambers (12\u2009mm in diameter, 8\u2009\u03bcm pore-size, Millipore, Billerica, MA) were used to evaluate the chemotactic motility of 4\u2009T1 cells in cancer environment. L-929-CAFs or CAFs were incubated in 24-well plates, 600\u2009\u03bcl medium containing ART, ARM, ARS or DHA was added to the lower compartment. L-929-CAFs were treated with 50\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA, CAFs were treated with 30\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA. 4\u2009T1 cells labeled with luciferase were collected in serum-free medium at a final concentration of 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/ml. 400\u2009\u03bcl cell suspensions were then placed in the upper transwell chamber. After incubation for 24\u2009h, cells on the upper surface were removed, and directional migration cells on the lower surface were fixed with 100% methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Then quantified by manual counting and three randomly chosen fields were analyzed for each group.Cell invasion assayCell invasion assay was performed as similar with cell directional migration assay above except that the matrigel (Corning, NY, USA) diluted by serum-free medium (1:8) was coated on the upper transwell chambers at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009h in advance. After 24\u2009h incubation, the invasion cells were fixed, stained and counted by microscope.Animal modelOrthotopic injections were performed following the previous study with minor modifications. 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104/25\u2009\u03bcl 4\u2009T1 cells labeled with luciferase, or 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104/25\u2009\u03bcl 4\u2009T1-luciferase cells plus 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104/25\u2009\u03bcl\u2009L-929 cells were suspended in 25\u2009\u03bcl matrigel on ice, and then the cell suspension was quickly injected into the fourth Mammary Fat Pad (MFP). Animal was observed for 30\u2009min until fully recovery. After 28\u2009days, the mice injected 4\u2009T1 cells were assigned to the negative control group (8 mice/group, gavage of 0.5% CMC-Na at a frequency of once every day), the mice injected 4\u2009T1-luciferase cells plus L-929 cells were randomly divided into six groups (8 mice/group): the control group (gavage of 0.5% CMC-Na at a frequency of once every day), the paclitaxel-positive group (intraperitoneal injection of 10\u2009mg/kg paclitaxel at a frequency of one time every 2\u2009day), the ART-treated group (gavage of 100\u2009mg/kg ART at a frequency of once every day); the ARM-treated group (gavage of 100\u2009mg/kg ARM at a frequency of once every day); the ARS-treated group (gavage of 100\u2009mg/kg ARS at a frequency of once every day); the DHA-treated group (gavage of 100\u2009mg/kg DHA at a frequency of once every day). The weight, tumor width (W) and Length (L) were measured by an average of three days. The tumor volume (V) was estimated with the formula: V\u2009=\u20091/2\u2009\u00d7\u2009L\u2009\u00d7\u2009W2. 28\u2009days later, mice bearing tumors were conducted optical imaging to determine the luciferase expression in the mouse model using the IVIS Lumina Bioluminescence Imaging System, then the nude mice were killed and the tumor xenografts were segregated and measured. Visceral tissue resected from mice were fixed in formalin and tested with H&E staining.This study was approved in SPF Animal Laboratory of China Pharmaceutical University. In all experiments, the ethics guidelines for investigations in conscious animals were followed, with approval from the local Ethics Committee for Animal Research.ImmunohistochemistryThe expression of Ki67, \u03b1-SMA, vimentin and TGF-\u03b21 of tumor tissues in nude mice model were assessed to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using a SPlink detection kit (Biotin-Streptavidin HRP Detection Systems). All reagents used in the experiments were supplied by ZSGB-Bio Co., Beijing, China. Observation and picture were taken under a light microscope.TUNEL assayApoptosis induction in the tissue specimen was analyzed by TUNEL test. It was performed as per instructions given in TUNEL FITC apoptosis detection kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The slides were photographed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).Sirius red staining assayTissue sections were stained using picrosirius red stain kit (Yeasen, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Observation and picture were taken under a light microscope.Statistical analysisThe data were obtained from at least three independent experiments and all data in different experimental groups were expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. The comparisons were made relative to CM-induced group or control group in vitro, 4\u2009T1\u2009+\u2009L-929 group in vivo. Differences between groups were tested with One-Way ANOVA analysis of variance and Dunnett\u2019s post hoc test. The changes in tumor volume over time were tested using a random effects mixed model. Metastasis incidence rates were evaluated using percentages of animals with metastases. The significance of differences is indicated at *p\u2009<\u20090.05 and **p\u2009<\u20090.01.ResultsARS and DHA reverted L-929-CAFs and CAFs from activated to inactivated stateARS and DHA reverted L-929-CAFs from activated to inactivated state.

Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 compared with the control group; **p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared with the control groupThe chemical structures of ART, ARM, ARS and DHA were shown in Fig.\u00a01a. In order to exclude the proliferation-inhibition effect of ART, ARM, ARS and DHA on L-929-CAFs and CAFs, CCK-8 cell counting assay was implemented. As shown in Figs. 1b and 2a, 50\u2009\u03bcM or 30\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA had little effect on cell viability of L-929-CAFs and CAFs. Therefore, these concentrations were then applied to all subsequent experiments in vitro.CAFs were identified by morphological characteristics and specific markers expression. In order to investigate the effects of CM induce-conditioned culture model, immunofluorescence staining assay and western blot assay were used to test the specific markers expression such as MMP-9, MMP-2, MMP-14, FAP, fibronectin, vimentin, \u03b1-SMA and S100A4. The results showed that these proteins were upregulated under 4\u2009T1 CM, which suggested that 4\u2009T1 CM could activate L-929 cells to L-929-CAFs in conditioned culture system (Fig. 1c-f). As shown in Figs. 1c-f and 2b-e, treatment of L-929-CAFs and CAFs with ARS or DHA decreased the expression of activation proteins, but ART and ARM had no effect on their expression, indicating that ARS and DHA could inhibit CAFs activation.ARS and DHA suppressed TGF-\u03b2 pathway to inhibit activation of L-929-CAFs and CAFsARS and DHA suppressed TGF-\u03b2 pathway to inhibit activation of L-929-CAFs and CAFs. L-929-CAFs and CAFs were treated with 50\u2009\u03bcM or 30\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA for 24\u2009h respectively. (a) The effect of ART, ARM, ARS and DHA on TGF-\u03b21 content of secreted cytokines. (b) The expression of p-Smad3 (Ser423/425), Smad3 and TGF-\u03b21 proteins in the cells were analyzed by western blot using specific antibodies. (c) The migration ability was evaluated by a cell directional migration assay (image magnification: 200\u00d7). (d) The invasive ability was evaluated by a matrigel-coated transwell invasion assay (image magnification: 200\u00d7). Each experiment was performed at least three times. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 compared with CM-induced or control group; **p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared with CM-induced or control groupBy Elisa assay and western blot analysis, we found that the secretion level of TGF-\u03b21 in L-929-CAFs was increased compared to normal L-929 cells, and ARS and DHA could reduce the protein expression of p-Smad3 (Ser423/425) and TGF-\u03b21 both in L-929-CAFs and CAFs, but no significant differences were found in ART and ARM groups (Fig.\u00a03a and b). Together these results provided important insight that ARS and DHA may inactive CAFs through TGF-\u03b21.Prior studies have noted the importance of activated fibroblasts, which can promote tumor development and invasion via their active secretome, including growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM). Cell directional migration assay and cell invasion assay were used to evaluate the effects of artemisinin and its derivatives on 4\u2009T1 cells migration and invasion in the presence of CAFs. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, L-929-CAFs could increase 4\u2009T1 cells migration and invasion in co-culture system. When L-929-CAFs and CAFs were treated with ARS and DHA, the migration and invasion of 4\u2009T1 cells were decreased dramatically compared with untreated CAFs. However, ART and ARM could not inhibit the migration and invasion of 4\u2009T1 cells. These results demonstrated that the promoting functions of CAFs on migration and invasion were impaired by ARS and DHA.ARS and DHA could not further inactivate L-929-CAFs and CAFs with TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibodyARS and DHA could not further inactivate L-929-CAFs and CAFs with TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody. L-929-CAFs and CAFs were treated with 50\u2009\u03bcM or 30\u2009\u03bcM of ART, ARM, ARS or DHA for 24\u2009h respectively. TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody was added to the culture system to exhaust secreted TGF-\u03b21. (a) The effect of ART, ARM, ARS and DHA on TGF-\u03b21 content of secreted cytokines. (b) The expression of MMP-9, fibronectin, vimentin, and \u03b1-SMA proteins in the cells were analyzed by western blot using specific antibodies. (c) The expression of p-Smad3 (Ser423/425), Smad3 and TGF-\u03b21 proteins in the cells were analyzed by western blot using specific antibodies. (d) The migration ability was evaluated by a cell directional migration assay (image magnification: 200\u00d7). (e) The invasive ability was evaluated by a matrigel-coated transwell invasion assay (image magnification: 200\u00d7). Each experiment was performed at least three times. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 compared with CM-induced or control group; **p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared with CM-induced or control groupTo confirm the significant roles of TGF-\u03b21 in the conditioned culture or co-culture system, we blocked the interaction of TGF-\u03b21 using TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody. As shown in 4A, 4B and 4C, Elisa assay and western blot assay proved that TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody could reduce the expression of TGF-\u03b21, and inhibited the activation effect of CAFs. Artemisinin and its derivatives could not further downregulate specific markers protein expression or suppress TGF-\u03b2 pathway with TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody. As shown in Fig.\u00a04d and e, the presence of TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody in the co-culture system reduced the number of migrated and invasive 4\u2009T1 cells. Artemisinin and its derivatives could not strength these inhibition effects when TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody was added to the co-culture system.ARS and DHA suppressed CAFs-induced cancer growth and metastasis in vivoARS and DHA suppressed CAFs-induced cancer growth and metastasis in vivo.

(g) H&E stained lungs and livers of mice to confirm the presence of micrometastases. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 compared with 4\u2009T1\u2009+\u2009L-929 group; **p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared with 4\u2009T1\u2009+\u2009L-929 groupThe breast cancer orthotopic model was used to see whether ART, ARM, ARS and DHA could affect CAF-induced tumor burden and metastatic effect in vivo (Fig.\u00a05a). It could be seen from the data in Fig. 5b-g that the presence of CAFs generated larger tumors, more bioluminescence signals and metastatic lesions than that did not have CAFs injected. As shown in Fig. 5b and c, the bioluminescence signals after 28-day treatment were significantly decreased by ARS and DHA. ARS and DHA significantly prolonged life span of tumor bearing mice compared with the other groups (Fig. 5d). As can be seen from Fig. 5e, the probabilities of metastasis induced by CAFs were down-regulated by ARS (50%) and DHA (37.5%), while that of paclitaxel, ART and ARM were 62.5, 87.5 and 87.5%. As shown in Fig. 5f, during 28-day treatment, ARS and DHA reduced tumor volume more apparently than paclitaxel, ART and ARM. In the orthotopic model, cancer cells could metastasize to several organs, including brain, lung, liver and bone. Afterwards, we analyzed the metastasis in lung and liver according to the pathological section. The results showed that ARS and DHA could suppress the formation of metastases in lung and liver (Fig. 5g).ARS and DHA inactivated cancer-associated fibroblasts through suppressing TGF-\u03b2 signaling in vivoARS and DHA inactivated CAFs through suppressing TGF-\u03b2 signaling in vivo.

(e) The expression of p-Smad3 (Ser423/425), Smad3 and TGF-\u03b21 proteins were analyzed in orthotopic site by western blot using specific antibodies. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 compared with 4\u2009T1\u2009+\u2009L-929 group; **p\u2009<\u20090.01 compared with 4\u2009T1\u2009+\u2009L-929 groupAs can be seen from Fig.\u00a06a, we investigated the effect of ART, ARM, ARS and DHA on CAF-induced orthotopic tumors by Ki67 detection and TUNEL assay. The proportions of Ki67 positive cells in tumor tissues were decreased at a small fraction after treatment with paclitaxel, ART, ARM, ARS and DHA. TUNEL assay performed to detect apoptotic cells in tumor tissues showed that ART, ARM, ARS and DHA could not induce DNA damage of tumor tissues. Therefore, we deduced that ART, ARM, ARS and DHA could not induce tumor apoptosis and limited cell proliferation inhibition in vivo. The results of sirius red staining assay, immunohistochemistry and western blot assay showed that ARS and DHA treatment decreased collagen in the tissue, and the expression of specific markers such as MMP-9, fibronectin, vimentin and \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 6a and b). By Elisa assay, we found that the secretion level of TGF-\u03b21 in CAF-induced tumors was increased, compared with that did not have CAFs injected (Fig. 6c). Meanwhile, the protein expression of p-Smad3 (Ser423/425) and TGF-\u03b21 were also increased in CAF-induced tumors (Fig. 6d and e). Consistently, as shown in Fig. 6c, d and e, the Elisa assay, immunohistochemistry assay and western blot assay verified that ARS and DHA could reduce the protein expression of p-Smad3 (Ser423/425) and TGF-\u03b21, but ART and ARM had no effect on the protein expression.DiscussionArtemisinin (ART) is a sesquiterpene lactone with a 1,2,4-trioxane ring system, extracted from the Chinese herb qinghao. Based on the sesquiterpene lactone template, three generations of artemisinin-like semisynthetic and fully synthetic endoperoxide compounds including artemether (ARM), artesunate (ARS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) were developed to improve the efficacy and tolerability. Previous studies reported that the effective drug concentrations on cancer cells are usually higher than those to kill malaria parasites. The endoperoxide moiety of artemisinin structure is responsible for its anti-malarial and anti-cancer effects. Reducing heme or ferrous iron can activate the endoperoxide bond and engender the cytotoxic carbon-centered radicals. However, the absence of endoperoxide moiety does not completely abolish the anticancer activity but significantly reduces cytotoxicity, which suggested that the anti-cancer activity of artemisinin and its derivatives may involve other alternative mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that artemisinin derivatives could inactivate cancer-associated fibroblasts to inhibit cancer growth and metastasis in breast cancer for the first time.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have an important role in tumor growth and metastasis, such as stimulating angiogenesis, cell proliferation, migration and invasion. CAFs could release growth factors and cytokines, produce metalloproteinases (MMPs) and down-regulate of CD36. CAFs could affect ECM stiffness at primary tumors, enhancing cancer cell migration and invasion by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Specific markers are used to identify CAFs, such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), fibroblastspecific protein-1 (FSP1, also called S100A4), fibroblast activating protein (FAP), vimentin, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b1 (PDGFR-\u03b1), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2 (PDGFR-\u03b2), chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan neuron-glial antigen-2 (NG2), and so on. Therefore, immunofluorescence and western blot assay were used to measure the effects of artemisinin and its derivatives on inactivating L-929-CAFs and CAFs in vitro. We found that ARS and DHA could decrease the expression of specific markers to inhibit CAFs activation, which was significant to evaluate the inactivation effects of artemisinin and its derivatives.TGF-\u03b2 binds to the type II receptor on the cell surface, recruiting the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor (TGF-\u03b2RI). Activated TGF-\u03b2RI phosphorylates the COOH-terminal regions of Smad2 and Smad3, forming a complex with Smad4 to translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus, regulating gene expression in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and ECM production. Anti-TGF-\u03b2 therapies have also been evaluated in cancer treatment because they could interfere with different components of the tumor environment. Our study demonstrated that ARS and DHA suppressed TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CAFs through decreased secretion of TGF-\u03b21. In addition, the increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 by CM induce-conditioned culture system was also decreased by ARS and DHA. When CAFs were treated with TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody, the effects of artemisinin and its derivatives on specific markers protein were not decreased significantly, and the inhibitions of TGF-\u03b2 signaling were not enhanced, which indicated that artemisinin derivatives inactivated CAFs may depend on TGF-\u03b21 expression.If fibroblasts expressed activation protein and secretory protein in tumor environment to become CAFs, the CAFs could not return to the quiescent stage. Consequently, developing drugs targeted CAFs at quiescent stage maybe an attractive therapeutic strategy, which can disrupt the tumor-stroma cross-talk and inhibit tumor progression. We found that although CAFs could induce 4\u2009T1 cells migration and invasion, artemisinin derivatives could also decrease the migration and invasion of 4\u2009T1 cells. In addition, artemisinin derivatives could not cause more reductive effects of migration and invasion when TGF-\u03b21 neutralizing antibody was added to the co-culture system. These findings suggested that artemisinin derivatives could decrease the cross-talk between CAFs and cancer cells to inhibit the tumor metastasis.The breast cancer orthotopic model in BALB/c nude mice was used to see whether artemisinin and its derivatives affected CAF-induced tumor burden and metastatic effect in vivo. Considering that oral drug administration is safer and more convenient, we adopted gavage instead of intravenous injection to reduce the toxicity in BALB/c nude mice. We observed that the presence of CAFs could induce larger cancer volume and more metastatic lesions. The results further verified that artemisinin and its derivatives suppressed TGF-\u03b2 signaling to reduce CAFs-induced cancer growth and metastasis in vivo.The present study was subject to a number of potential methodological weaknesses, such as co-cultures and xenograft mouse models. These experimental models are fundamental to preclinical cancer research, but substantial gaps exist between the results of these experiments and those obtained in clinical settings. Further studies are required in order to validate the effectiveness of artemisinin derivatives in cancer in clinical study.ConclusionsIn conclusion, ARS and DHA could suppress TGF-\u03b2 signaling, thus inactivated cancer-associated fibroblasts, and finally inhibited cancer growth and metastasis. Therefore, artemisinin derivatives might be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of breast cancer.AbbreviationsARMArtemetherARSArtesunateARTArtemisininCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsDHADihydroartemisininECMExtracellular matrixEMTEpithelial-mesenchymal transitionFAPFibroblast activating proteinFGF2Fibroblast growth factor 2FSP1 (S100A4)Fibroblast specific protein-1MFPMammary fat padMMPsMetalloproteinasesNG2Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan neuron-glial antigen-2PDGFPlatelet-derived growth factorSDF1Stromal cell-derived factor 1TGF-\u03b2Transforming growth factor-\u03b2TMETumor microenvironmentTNFTumor necrosis factorTVTumor volume\u03b1-SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinAuthors\u2019 contributionsYYY, QLG and NL proposed the study.

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Only TIL PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with CAF PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CAF PD-L1 expression according to the SP-142 and E1L3N assays was also significantly associated with TIL PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u00a00.001 for both), similar to the 73\u201310 assay (Tables\u00a03, 4).

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

Fibroadenomas showed uneven Ten periductal reactions while in all carcinomas, the stroma showed extensive and strong reactions that were most intense at the tumors' invasive edge. EDA-cFn's distribution was similar to Ten's but the staining was stronger while EDB- and Onc-cFn were virtually restricted to fetal breasts and carcinomas. In the normal adult breast, alpha 1,2,3 and alpha 6, and B1 and beta 4 integrins were detected in myoepithelial cells; weaker staining was also noted in the basolateral aspect of luminal cells; this profile was retained--and at times enhanced--in FCD, fibroadenomas and in situ carcinomas in which myoepithelial elements were present. In carcinomas, particularly in those of high grade, integrins tended to be reduced. However, mucinous carcinomas showed enhanced expression and the emergence of alpha 5 integrin that was not in the normal repertory; also a subset of infiltrating lobular carcinomas showed prominent alpha 1 and alpha 6 and beta 1 and--rarely--beta 4 staining distributed in delicate cytoplasmic processes (kinetopodia). These data indicate that the complex cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions of the normal breast are slightly altered in hyperplastic processes and benign neoplasms whereas profound chances occur in carcinomas. The latter display enhanced Ten and EDA- and Onc-cFn expression in particular, while most integrins appear decreased. Notably, mucinous and some lobular carcinomas display enhancement of certain integrins. The conspicuous localization of integrins in kinetopodia may be significant in relation to the invasive behavior of lobular carcinomas.",

        "full_text": "A virtual teaching clinic for virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the rapid transition of in-person outpatient care to telemedicine, and clinical training to remote learning. The endocrinology fellows at the University of Michigan maintain their own continuity-of-care clinics and rotate in the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System. For these clinics, we sought to preserve patient staffing with expert attending physicians and continue the clinical training experience in a remote setting.We have adapted the online conferencing platform, Zoom, to integrate learners into a virtual teaching clinic environment. By using the Zoom \u201cbreakout room\u201d feature, fellows are able to match staffing attending physicians to different patient cases, according to attending physicians\u2019 areas of specialty. Similar to the traditional teaching clinic environment, our remote staffing strategy has ensured that fellows continue to provide excellent patient care and fulfill educational aims across our University and VA facilities.Outpatient clinics in other University of Michigan departments and other academic centers have inquired about or have begun utilizing our method. Even beyond COVID-19, our paradigm potentially provides a convenient virtual staffing platform to serve patient populations with geographic or transportation challenges. Following implementation, stakeholders can regularly evaluate the approach to continually improve both patient care and medical education.BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought profound challenges across all spheres of medicine, including medical education. Trainees typically acquire outpatient clinical knowledge through in-person care of patients with attending physician supervision. Outpatient care has transitioned to telemedicine visits, and training curricula have shifted to remote learning. With trainees and faculty members sheltering at home, we sought a solution that allows multiple providers to provide education and patient care from different locations.Transition to virtual teaching clinicThe endocrinology fellows at the University of Michigan maintain a continuity-of-care clinic, in which different attending physicians rotate every week to staff patients. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, four attending endocrinologists would be stationed in workrooms, and the eight fellows would staff each patient with an available attending physician, seeking also to match a faculty physician\u2019s area of expertise to the given complaint. The endocrinology clinics at the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System operate under a similar paradigm with trainees and attending endocrinologists. When outpatient clinics rapidly transitioned to telemedicine, we endeavored to create an efficient virtual environment, which preserved expert patient staffing and continued the educational experience in a remote setting.Online conferencing platforms have become indispensable tools for remote work and group teaching. We adapted a Michigan Medicine secure Zoom (San Jose, CA) platform to integrate learners into a virtual teaching clinic environment. Zoom provides a \u201cbreakout room\u201d feature, which allows the conference \u201chost\u201d (a Chief Fellow) to set up private communications among participants outside of the main session. The host assigns each conference participant to one breakout room; the participants can then switch between their single assigned breakout room and the main session, but cannot visit other breakout rooms. While it was simple to assign each attending physician a unique breakout room, it was challenging to create a virtual clinic that enabled fellows to rotate among faculty-specific breakout rooms.To overcome this cumbersome inconvenience in the Zoom environment, all fellow participants are assigned \u201cco-host\u201d status. As co-hosts, each fellow has the ability to self-reassign to different breakout rooms, without involving the host. This scheme obviates the need for the meeting host to change room assignments during clinic, thus creating efficient and flexible virtual staffing rooms.Panel a Protocol for telephone visits. Attending physicians join virtual meeting room at the start of clinic and cycle through staffing patients. Attending physicians may speak with patients at the conclusion of visits when necessary. Panel b Protocol for video visits. Attending physician always join video portal (Video Connect at Veterans Affairs Healthcare System or Epic Cantu / Haiku application at Michigan Medicine) with fellow after staffing caseAt the start of clinic, all attending physicians congregate in the Zoom main session, while fellows begin video and telephone patient encounters. Each time a fellow is ready to staff a case, the fellow joins the main session, identifies the most appropriate attending physician available, and moves to the corresponding breakout room (Fig.\u00a01). Telephone visits are completed when the fellow calls the patient back to discuss the final plan, with the option of the attending physician joining in a three-way telephone call. For video visits, the fellow and attending physician join the patient in a three-way video visit through the Epic electronic medical record platform or VA Video Connect platform \u2013 which are muted or discontinued during the actual staffing discussion. After discussing the case, the attending physician then returns to the main session to staff subsequent patients. This method allows fellows to staff patients with different attending physicians by moving freely amongst the respective breakout rooms. When our fellows\u2019 continuity-of-care clinics were converted to telemedicine with virtual staffing, the clinic appointment templates were not changed, and patient volume during the pandemic decreased slightly. In the month of April 2019, each fellow saw an average of 5.2 patients per four-hour half day, and each attending physician staffed an average of 7.8 patients. In comparison, in April 2020, fellows saw 4.5 patients, and attending physicians staffed 7.2 patients. While detailed time studies were not completed, our subjective sense is that decreased patient volume and absence of physical exams shortened staffing wait times and duration of patient visits.ConclusionsOur strategy has ensured that fellows continue to provide the best care to our patients in our University and VA facilities. Similar to the traditional teaching clinic environment, fellows seek the guidance of our experts across different areas, despite all providers and patients being physically miles apart. In addition to providing excellent patient care and fulfilling educational aims, this process also meets supervision requirements for billed services by the attending physicians. Furthermore, ad-hoc expert faculty can join the clinic for a specific patient as needed, simply by joining the Zoom platform. We use widely available technology that is easy to set up and maintains Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance. Even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, our paradigm provides a convenient virtual staffing platform to serve patient populations with geographic or transportation challenges, while easing the burden of provider commutes. Following implementation, stakeholders can regularly assess the platform to continually improve both medical care and education. For example, patients can be surveyed on their satisfaction with virtual care. Trainees can evaluate the quality of teaching received, and faculty can provide feedback on learner performance. Training programs can perform time studies to quantify the relative duration of patient history-taking, staffing discussions, and staffing wait times. Healthcare systems can monitor outcome metrics for patients receiving virtual versus in-person care. The virtual teaching clinic approach can be an iterative one, easily adapted to other training program clinics to maintain the mission of teaching hospitals and clinics.AbbreviationsVAVeterans AffairsHIPAAHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability ActPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors have drafted the work or substantively revised it.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is highly invasive and metastatic, which is in urgent need of transformative therapeutics. Tubeimu (TBM), the rhizome of <iBolbostemma paniculatum</i (Maxim.) Franquet, is one of the Chinese medicinal herbs used for breast diseases since the ancient times. The present study evaluated the efficacy, especially the anti-metastatic effects of the dichloromethane extract of Tubeimu (ETBM) on TNBC orthotopic mouse models and cell lines. We applied real-time imaging on florescent orthotopic TNBC mice model and tested cell migration and invasion abilities with MDA-MB-231 cell line.

Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were delivered to confirm the gene expression changes. ETBM exhibited noticeable control on tumor metastasis and growth of TNBC tumors with no obvious toxicity. In compliance with this, it also showed inhibition of cell migration and invasion <iin vitro</i. Its impact on the changed biological behavior in TNBC may be a result of decreased expression of integrin \u03b21 (ITG\u03b21), integrin \u03b28 (ITG\u03b28) and Rho GTPase activating protein 5 (ARHGAP5), which disabled the focal adhesion pathway and caused change in cell morphology. This study reveals that ETBM has anti-metastatic effects on MDA-MB-231-GFP tumor and may lead to a new therapeutic agent for the integrative treatment of highly invasive TNBC.",

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

One of the major challenges for the treatment of breast cancer is its heterogeneous nature, which reflects the different responses to the therapy. Commonly, breast cancer is classified into four major molecular subtypes and each of these has different risk factors for incidence, therapeutic responses, disease progression and preferential organ sites of metastasis. For instance, the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibits the resistance to different chemotherapies and represents the most aggressive tumor characterized by a low 5-year survival rate (approximately <\u200930%). To date, the rate of relapse and the mortality of patients affected by TNBC results at least in part from tumor cell spreading and the consequent development of metastasis. Signals generated from the interaction between cancer cells and the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) are considered the most common molecular drivers required for cancer cell migration and invasion. In particular, integrin receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, cytokine receptors and tyrosine kinases receptors, sense changes in ECM composition leading to the activation of numerous subcellular biomechanic structures. Among these, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2), has been shown to exert a main role in facilitating and promoting the invasiveness of tumor cells. Upon activation by integrin-ECM engagment or GPCR agonists, FAK can be phosphorylated at the Y397 residue, which allows the formation of a binding site for many SH2 domain containing molecules like Src, PI3K, Grb7 and PLC\u03b3. In addition to its function as tyrosine kinase, FAK serves as a scaffolding protein triggering the recruitment of diverse molecules to its tyrosine sites. The multifaceted interactions of FAK with various signal transduction mediators may contribute to the FAK-dependent processes involved in cancer development. Indeed, FAK action has been associated to aggressive cancer features as the cell adhesion and spreading, the enhancement of cell proliferation and survival and the facilitation of invasive cell phenotypes. In this context, it is worth mentioning that FAK was shown to be over-expressed in a wide variety of human malignancies, including invasive and metastatic breast tumors. Indeed, increased FAK expression and activity has been correlated with different poor prognostic indicators in breast cancer patients. In this regard, it has been observed that the inhibition of FAK may reduce the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells, indicating FAK as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of aggressive malignancies. Neverthless, a better understanding on the molecular mechanisms through which FAK activation may contribute to breast cancer progression is still needed.In recent years, several studies have characterized the role of the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER, also known as GPR30) in the context of the rapid actions exerted by estrogens. Our and other previous investigations have demonstrated that estrogenic GPER signaling mediates stimulatory effects in both breast cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. In this vein, it has been reported that GPER activation triggers different transduction cascades including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and cyclic AMP (cAMP) production. GPER was also shown to mediate gene expression changes, important biological responses like cell proliferation and migration and it was found negatively correlated with relapse free survival in breast cancer patients.In the framework of the aforementioned findings, in the current study we have focused on the role of GPER in the regulation of FAK signaling by estrogens using the invasive and metastatic TNBC MDA-MB 231 and SUM159 cells as experimental model. Taking advantage of publicly available large-scale genomics and patient data sets as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we have found a higher expression of PTK2 gene encoding FAK in TNBC respect to non-TNBC and normal breast tissues. Next, we have observed that estrogens through GPER triggers Y397 FAK phosphorylation, increase FAs and induce gene expression changes. Corroborating these findings, FAK inhibition prevented the migration skill of MDA-MB 231 and SUM159 cells induced by estrogens via GPER. On the basis of the aforementioned results, GPER contributes to the estrogen-activated FAK signaling. Moreover, our data suggest that the GPER-FAK transduction pathway may be considered in more comprehensive targeted therapies in TNBC.MethodsPublicly database and bioinformatics analysisThe clinical significance of PTK2 (FAK coding gene) in TNBC was assessed by microarray data of NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) archive (GSE38959) [pubmed: 23254957] and RNA sequencing data in Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort of TCGA project (The Cancer Genome Atlas: https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) [pubmed: 23000897]. The gene expression data of GEO and TCGA were retrieved on August 2nd, 2018 from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), cBioportal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) or UCSC Xena (https://xena.ucsc.edu/) [pubmed:23550210 and bioRxiv:326470]. The normalized mRNA expression values in the RNA sequencing data were processed and distributed in log2 transformed RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization) values (cBioportal) or log2 transformed (RSEM+\u20091) (UCSC Xena). The Z-scores of PTK2 mRNA expression data and clinical sample information corresponding to breast cancer patients were collected from cBioportal. The status of ER, PR and HER2 IHCs were used for classification of breast cancer subtypes. The PTK2 High group (mRNA Z-score more than 1) and the PTK2 Low group (mRNA Z-score equal or less than 1) were analyzed by Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves and log-rank statistics.Cell culturesTNBC cell lines MDA-MB 231 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA).

The Renilla luciferase expression vector pRL-TK (Promega, Milan, Italy) was used as internal transfection control. MDA-MB 231 TNBC cells (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500\u2009\u03bcl/well culture medium containing 5% FBS. Cell medium was replaced on the day of transfection with serum-free medium and transfection was performed using X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent as recommended by the manufacture (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and a mixture containing 0.5\u2009\u03bcg of each reporter plasmid and 5\u2009ng of pRL-TK.

FAs images were acquired on the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) and analysed using the software Gen5 (BioTek, Winooski, VT).STAT3 nuclear immunofluorescence staining50% confluent MDA-MB 231 cells grown on 6 well plates were serum-deprived and then treated for 1\u2009h with E2 and G1 alone or in the presence of GPER antagonist G-15 or VS-4718 FAK inhibitor, as indicated. Next, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight with or without (negative control) a rabbit primary antibody against STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Milan, Italy). After incubation, the wells were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:400; purchased from Alexa Fluor, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) for 1\u2009h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in PBS buffer containing 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), (1:1000), (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) 10\u2009min at room temperature for nuclear staining. Imaging showing nuclear STAT3 accumulation were acquired on the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) and analysed using the software Gen5 (BioTek, Winooski, VT).Transwell migration assayMigration assay was performed in triplicate using boyden chambers (Costar Transwell, 8\u2009mm polycarbonate membrane, Sigma Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Briefly, MDA-MB 231 and SUM159 cells were seeded onto the upper membrane of the chamber at a density of 2,5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009105 cells/ml. Next, the cells were exposed to the treatment with E2 or G1 used alone or in combination with GPER antagonist G-15, VS4718 FAK inhibitor or STA21 STAT3 inhibitor. 4\u2009h after seeding, the cells on the bottom side of the membrane, were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with methanol and finally stained with GIEMSA for 15\u2009min at room temperature. Cell migrated were counted by using Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT).Scratch wound healing assayMDA-MB 231 cells were allowed to grow in 6 well/plates in regular medium supplemented with 5% FBS until they reached a 70 to 80% confluence. To create a scratch of the cell monolayer, a p200 pipette tip was used. Cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove the detached cells and treated with the various compounds, as indicated. The migration ability of the cells was evaluated after 24\u2009h of treatments.Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman\u2013Keuls\u2019 testing to determine differences in means. p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsDatabase analysis of the PTK2 gene encoding FAK in TNBCThe PTK2 gene encoding FAK is over-expressed in TNBC. a Comparison of PTK2 mRNA expression between laser-microbeam microdissected TNBC and normal breast cells. b Comparison of PTK2 mRNA expression between matched TNBC and non-tumor breast tissues. c Comparison of PTK2 mRNA expression among non-tumor breast tissues, ER+/PR+/HER2-, ER-/PR-/HER2+ and TNBC as reported in TCGA. d Clinical outcome in all types of breast cancer with high PTK2 (mRNA Z-score\u2009>\u20091) or low PTK2 (mRNA Z-score\u2009\u2264\u20091) displayed by Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank tests. e Clinical outcome in TNBC patients with high PTK2 (mRNA Z-score\u2009>\u20091) or low PTK2 (mRNA Z-score\u2009\u2264\u20091) displayed by Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank testsPrevious studies have shown the potential role of FAK toward the breast tumorigenesis and aggressive breast tumor phenotypes. On the basis of these findings, we began our study exploring the clinical significance of the FAK encoding gene PTK2 in TNBC by the TCGA database (http://cbioportal.org). The analysis of the RNA sequencing data derived from Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort of TCGA project (The Cancer Genome Atlas: https://cancergenome.nih.gov/), revealed that the PTK2 mRNA expression levels are significantly higher in TNBC compared with normal breast tissues in two independent cohort datasets (Fig.\u00a01a-b). In addition, we found that the PTK2 mRNA expression levels are significantly higher also in ER+/PR+/HER2- and ER-/PR-/HER2+ breast tumors respect to normal breast tissues, however the TNBC samples displayed the highest expression levels among the different breast cancer phenotypes (Fig. 1c). Next, we also assessed the Kaplan\u2013Meier univariate survival of patients groups, comparing those with high PTK2 (mRNA Z-score more than 1) with those exhibiting low PTK2 (mRNA Z-score equal or less than 1). In this regard, we ascertained that the PTK2 high group has a significant poorer overall survival respect to the PTK2 low group in all types of breast cancer as well as in TNBC (Fig. 1d-e). Overall, these data highlight the role of FAK in breast cancer toward the malignant aggressiveness as in TNBC patients.GPER mediates FAK activation and the induction of FAs by E2 and G1E2 and G1 trigger FAK Y397 activation in TNBC cells.

(*) indicates p\u2009<\u20090.05FAK represents a main component in the integrins-mediated transduction pathway and contributes to diverse signaling cascades triggered by a wide range of stimuli as growth factors, cytokines and G-protein coupled receptor agonists. As previous studies have revealed that estrogens may regulate the focal adhesion complexes not only through the classical estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) in breast tumor and endothelial cells but also via GPER in human dermal fibroblasts, we aimed to investigate whether GPER is involved in the activation of FAK in TNBC MDA-MB 231 and SUM159 cells. Both E2 and the GPER selective agonist G1 triggered the Y397 FAK phosphorylation along with the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT in MDA-MB 231 cells (Fig.\u00a02a-b), however these responses were no longer evident in the presence of the GPER antagonist G-15 (Fig. 2c-e) or using the FAK inhibitor namely VS-4718 (also known as PND-1186) (Fig.\u00a03a-d). Likewise, we ascertained that both the GPER antagonist G-15 and the FAK kinase inhibitor VS-4718 prevent the Y397 FAK phosphorylation induced by E2 and G1 in SUM159 TNBC cells (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1A-D). Next, we assessed that the c-Src kinase inhibitor PP2 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059, but not the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, abolish the Y397 FAK phosphorylation upon E2 and G1 exposure (Fig. 3e-j). As expected, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, inhibited respectively the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT induced by E2 and G1 (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Figure S2A-D). Overall, these findings point out that FAK activation by estrogenic signaling may occur through the GPER/c-Src/MEK transduction pathway. As FAs are important sub-cellular structure mediating cell adhesion to ECM in tumor spreading, we then determined by immunofluorescence assays that FAs formation prompted by E2 and G1 is prevented using the GPER antagonist G-15 (Fig.\u00a04a-c), thus suggesting the involvement of GPER in the above mentioned response observed in MDA-MB 231 cells.FAK is involved in the STAT3 nuclear accumulation and gene expression changes induced by E2 and G1 through GPERThe GPER antagonist G-15 reduces STAT3 nuclear accumulation triggered by estrogens. a Immunofluorescence staining of STAT3 in MDA-MB 231 cells treated for 1\u2009h with 100\u2009nM E2 and 100\u2009nM\u2009G1 alone or in combination with 100\u2009nM GPER antagonist G-15.

(*) indicates p\u2009<\u20090.05It has been reported that FAK knockdown may affect the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is a point of convergence for numerous oncogenic pathways. As GPER was also involved in the activation of STAT3, we aimed to evaluate the role of FAK in the STAT3 nuclear accumulation triggered by estrogenic GPER signaling. Of note, we found that E2 and G1 induce the nuclear shuttle of STAT3, however this effect was no longer evident in the presence of the GPER antagonist G-15 (Fig. 5a-b) or using the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 (Fig.\u00a06a-b), as assessed by immunofluorescence assay in MDA-MB 231 cells. As our and other previous studies have evidenced that GPER triggers a specific gene signature in breast cancer cells toward relevant biological effects, we then sought to investigate whether STAT3 may contribute to gene expression changes mediated by GPER in MDA-MB 231 cells. First, we assessed that the GPER antagonist G-15 and the STAT3 inhibitor namely STA21 repress the transactivation of c-FOS (Fig.\u00a07a), EGR1 (Fig. 7b) and CTGF (Fig. 7c) promoter activity triggered by E2 and G1 treatments. In accordance with these results, G-15 and STA21 reduced the mRNA expression levels of c-FOS, EGR1 and CTGF induced by E2 and G1 (Fig. 7d). Interestingly, c-FOS, EGR1 and CTGF protein levels induced by E2 and G1 were abrogated using STA21 (Fig. 7e-f) and both the mRNA and protein levels of c-FOS, EGR1 and CTGF triggered by E2 and G1 were prevented using the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 (Fig. 7g-i). Altogether, these results reveal that STAT3 along with FAK may contribute to the regulation of GPER target genes in TNBC cells.FAK and STAT3 inhibition prevents the migration of TNBC cellsThe FAK inhibitor VS-4718 inhibits the migration of TNBC cells induced by E2 and G1. a Boyden Chamber assays showing the migration of MDA-MB 231 cells treated for 4\u2009h with 100\u2009nM E2 and 100\u2009nM\u2009G1 alone or in combination with 1\u2009\u03bcM FAK kinase inhibitor VS-4718.

White dotted lines indicate the wound borders at the beginning of the assay and recorded 24\u2009h post- scratching. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. (*) indicates p\u2009<\u20090.05Several reports have highlighted the role of FAK in the migration of cancer cells. Accordingly, we assessed that the migratory effects induced by E2 and G1 were abolished not only in the presence of the GPER antagonist G-15 (Additional\u00a0file 3: Figure S3A) but also using the FAK inhibitor VS-4718, as evaluated by boyden chamber assay performed in MDA-MB 231 cells (Fig.\u00a08a). In addition, scratch monolayer experiments evidenced that G-15 (Additional file 3: Figure S3B) and VS-4718 (Fig. 8b) lessen the wound closure triggered by E2 and G1. In order to further corroborate these results, we assessed that both the GPER antagonist G-15 and the FAK inhibitor VS-4718 reduce the migration of SUM159 cells stimulated by E2 and G1 (Additional file 4: Figure S4A). As STAT3 may contribute to the migration of breast cancer cells, we aimed to ascertain its involvement in the migratory features of TNBC cells mediated by GPER. Boyden chamber and wound healing assays revealed that the migration of MDA-MB 231 cells stimulated by E2 and G1 is abolished using the STAT3 inhibitor STA21 (Fig.\u00a09a-b). Overall, both FAK and STAT3 may contribute to the invasive skills of TNBC cells prompted by estrogenic GPER signaling.DiscussionIn the present study, we first assessed that the mRNA expression of PTK2/FAK is associated with worse survival rates and up-regulated in the aggressive TNBC respect to non-TNBC and normal breast samples, as determined by a bioinformatic analysis of cancer genomics TCGA datasets (www.cbioportal.org). Next, to provide novel insights on the molecular mechanisms through which FAK may be involved in the TNBC progression, we ascertained its role in gene expression changes and the migratory skills of TNBC cells triggered by estrogenic GPER signaling. In particular, we found that GPER stimulation induces Y397 FAK phosphorylation and increases the number of FAs in TNBC cells. In addition, we demonstrated the role exerted by FAK in the GPER-mediated nuclear accumulation of STAT3 and the involvement of both FAK and STAT3 toward the regulation of GPER target genes and the migratory responses of TNBC cells.Several studies have correlated FAK expression and activity with different types of primary and metastatic cancers, including breast malignancy. In this regard, FAK expression was shown not only associated with invasive and metastatic breast cancer, but also as an early event occurring in breast tumorigenesis. In accordance with these studies, the expression of FAK was linked to a poor clinical outcome, therefore further highlighting the contribution of FAK in the development of breast tumor.It has been established that FAK plays a main action in the formation of focal adhesion complexes, hence acting as a key regulator of important processes in both normal and cancer cells. A well characterized mechanism promoting FAK activation involves the integrin-ECM engagment and the subsequent co-clustering of proteins (i.e. talin and paxillin) with the cytoplasmic tail of integrin. In addition, FAK may be activated by various extracellular stimuli such as steroids like estrogens, growth factors, cytokines, phospholipids, lipid mediators and GPCRs initiated pathways.Estrogens may be involved in the regulation of several cytoskeletal and membrane remodeling components as the focal adhesion complexes. In particular, estrogens regulate cell morphology and the interaction with ECM, thus driving the cell movement under the control of the actin organization. In this regard, it has been reported that estrogens through ER\u03b1 induce the phosphorylation of FAK and its subsequent translocation within the membrane sites where focal adhesion complexes are assembled. Besides, estrogens-induced cytoskeleton re-organization and focal adhesion strengthening may also occur via GPER, which mediates estrogenic signaling in diverse types of tumors. Further extending the aforementioned findings, in the present study we have documented that estrogens through GPER triggers the activation of FAK in TNBC cells, in accordance with previous data obtained in different cancer cell contexts.Estrogenic GPER signaling may contribute to the regulation of several genes in tumor cells via diverse transcription factors as well as the involvement of STAT3. Upon activation STAT3 forms homo- or heterodimers through the SH2 and the C-terminal domains, then translocates into the nucleus where it binds specific sequences located in the promoter sequences of target genes. In this scenario, our immunofluorescence studies revealed that GPER mediates an enhanced nuclear accumulation of STAT3 in TNBC cells. Interestingly, this effect was prevented not only in the presence of the GPER antagonist G-15, but also using the FAK inhibitor VS-4718, in accordance with previous studies suggesting that FAK is involved in the STAT3 activation and transcriptional activity. Of note, not only the GPER antagonist G15 but also the DNA-binding STAT3 inhibitor STA21 reduced the promoter activity and the expression of the GPER target genes c-FOS, EGR1 and CTGF, further corroborating the involvement of STAT3 in the regulation of these genes. Likewise, the expression levels of c-FOS, EGR1 and CTGF were reduced using the FAK inhibitor VS-4718, thus suggesting that FAK is also involved in the GPER-mediated regulation of the aforementioned genes.FAK signaling has long been linked to the cell migration process, which represents a crucial skill toward cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Indeed, several FAK-downstream pathways have been implicated in cell migration as Src and PI3K transduction cascades. In addition, FAK-mediated cell migration was shown to require diverse key factors involved in the cytoskeleton remodeling as the Rho subfamily of small GTPases, N-WASP, and Arp2/3 complex. On the basis of these observations, FAK inhibitors are currently considered promising chemoterapeutic agents. In this respect, our data further highlight the use of FAK inhibitors given that the treatments with VS-4718 prevented the migration of TNBC cells upon the agonist activation of GPER. Overall, our findings suggest that FAK is involved in the stimulatory action of GPER in TNBC cells, however further investigations are needed to better define this functional cooperation toward the aggressive features of breast malignancy.ConclusionIn the present study we have provided new evidence regarding the engagement of FAK in the estrogenic GPER signaling in TNBC cells. In particular, we have assessed that FAK contributes to the GPER mediated STAT3 activation, the gene expression changes and the invasiveness of TNBC cells. Together, these findings suggest that the action of GPER through FAK may be considered toward combination treatments targeting TNBC.Additional filesAbbreviationsFAKFocal adhesion kinaseGPERG-coupled protein estrogen receptorSTA21STAT3 inhibitorSTAT3Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3TNBCTriple negative breast cancerVS-4718FAK inhibitorAuthors\u2019 contributionsDCR, MFS, RL, AV, MTDM and MM conceived the study, analyzed and interpreted the data.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

The prognosis of breast cancer is classified by variables such as histological type, grade, stages and receptor status. The receptor status can be classified as estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER), progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) positive (also called triple positive or Luminal B).The tumors that do not express the receptors (ER, PR or HER2) are also called triple negative tumors, while the HER2 positive and Luminal A with ER, PR positive and HER2 negative consitute separate subgroups. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been shown to predict the clinical outcome, and in particular breast cancers expressing hormone receptors (luminal A) have a more favorable prognosis, while women with basal-like breast cancers (including most of the triple-negative tumors) had shorter relapse-free survival times than women with other types of breast cancer. Despite differences in taxonomy, there is a consistent trend across all studies confirming the relatively poor prognosis of the triple-negative or basal-like breast cancer subgroup, and patients with triple-negative breast cancer, carries the worst prognosis among all subtypes due to the highly aggressive and metastatic potential of this subtype. As such, many preclinical and clinical studies have focused on developing effective therapeutics for this group of patients.The main features of metastasis is that primary tumor cells migrate to and invade distant sites through multiple steps. Accumulating evidence has shown that the hypoxic tumor microenvironment plays a key role in regulating breast cancer progression and metastasis, in particular via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a master regulator of the hypoxic response. Enhanced oxygen tension will degrade HIF-1 and thereby shut off genes that are generally stimulated by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. In addition, hypoxia is considered to be important for initiating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), where cancer cells lose key epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and obtain mesenchymal markers including N-cadherin. Tumor cells undergoing EMT change morphology from a cobble-stone like phenotype to a flat and spindle-shaped mesenchymal type with high level of motility proteins, enabling invasion, extravasation and metastatic niche formation. Thus, there is a close relationship between hypoxia and tumor metastasis.Hypoxia is considered critical for tumor progression. Our group has previously shown that the opposite, hyperoxia (HBOT-hyperbaric oxygen treatment) attenuates or significantly reduces breast cancer growth using a chemically induced (DMBA) (triple positive) model and a murine triple negative (4T1) adenocarcinoma model. Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that hyperoxia induced a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in the DMBA breast cancer model. These findings, together with a significantly decreased collagen deposition in the tumors, indicated that HBOT induced a less aggressive tumor behavior. In addition, a study showed a reduction in tumor interstitial pressure with a concomitant increase in uptake of the chemotherapeutic agent 5FU after HBOT.Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of HBOT on tumor growth of two different receptor subtypes of human breast tumors; the triple positive BT-474 and the triple negative MDA-MB-231 model. In addition, the effect of HBOT on 5FU efficacy, as well as the development of metastatic lesions was investigated in the latter model.Materials and methodsThe cell-lines and cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and grown in F12K (Bio-Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium) or RPMI medium, respectively, supplemented with 100 ml/L of fetal calf serum, 100 U/L of penicillin and 100 mg/L of streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). The cells were amplified as a monolayer in plastic tissue culture flasks 75 cm2 (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) in a humidified incubator set at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and 95% air, and were seeded until approximately 80% confluence.AnimalsFemale NOD/SCID mice (Jackson Laboratory, USA), age 7\u201310 weeks, weighing 20\u201325 g were used. The mice were kept in individually ventilated, pathogen-free cages where they had free access to food and water ad libitum. All the experiments were approved by the Norwegian Committee for Animal Research (FOTS project number: 23135440). Bodyweight, activity, tumor size and skin changes were monitored carfully throughout the experiments. No animals showed any signs of illness following tumor formation and metastasis and none died due to the experimental procedure.Mouse model for human breast cancer xenograftsFor the xenograft experiments, 5 x 105 tumor cells, in 0.15 ml PBS were injected subcutaneously on one side and into the fat pad of their mammary crest in the groin area. For the BT-474 xenograft, sixty-day release pellets containing 17\u03b2-Estradiol (1.7 mg) and progesterone (10 mg) (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) were implanted subcutaneously in the neck 2 days prior to injecting the cells. By day 8, when 100% of the mice had developed palpable tumors, they were assigned to either hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) or control.Tumor volume was measured every three days using a caliper. The location of the tumor only allowed measurements in two dimensions. The best estimate of tumor volume given these restrictions was a calculation based on a cylindrically shaped tumor according to the following equation: Tumor volume (mm3) = (short axis)2 x (long axis) x (\u03c0/6).After completion of the study, the mice were sacrificed with CO2 when fully anesthetized using Ketalar-Dormicum and the whole tumor was excised and processed for subsequent immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT)A hyperbaric animal research chamber (27 liter, OXYCOM 250 ARC, HYPCOMOY, Tampere, Finland) was used. The chamber was flushed with pure O2 for approximately 15 minutes at normal ambient pressure. The pressure was then slowly increased from 1 to 2.5 bar (equivalent to 15 msw) during approximately 10 minutes, and was kept stable at this pressure for another 90 minutes. To ensure levels above 97%, the chamber was flushed with pure O2 every 10 minutes for 5 min. After the treatment the chamber was slowly decompressed to 1 bar over a period of approximately 15 minutes. The mice underwent this treatment on days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16. Day 1 (starting measurements) was set as being 8 days after the injection of tumor cells. For the separate metastatic study, the mice underwent 17 treatments, i.e. every third day, during the whole 54 day period.5-Fluorouracil (5FU)To evaluate if HBOT could potentiate drug efficacy, the chemotherapeutic drug Fluorouracil, 5FU (50 mg/ml, Hospira Nordic AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was administered i.v. at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg in a volume of 0.1 ml as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with HBOT. In the latter case it was given immediately prior to each HBOT for optimal effect.CD31-stainingOn the last day of measurements, the tumors were quickly dissected out, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380\u00b0C until further use. The frozen tumor tissue was embedded in Tissue Tek (Sakura Fintek Europe, Zoeterwounde, the Netherlands) and cut into 10\u201320 \u03bcm slices with a cryostat microtome (Leica CM 3050 S-Cryostat, Nussloch, Germany). Blood vessels in the frozen slides of tumor (10 \u03bcm) were immunostained with rat anti-mouse CD31 (1:200) (AbD serotec, Morphosys UK Ltd, Oxford, UK) as primary antibody. Biotinylated rabbit-anti-rat (Vectastatin ABC kit, peroxidase Rat IgG PK 4004, Bioteam AS, Trondheim, Norway) was used as secondary antibody. Rabbit serum was used as a blocking agent and H2O2 in methanol was used to quench endogenous peroxidases. An avidin biotin peroxidase complex was used to bind to the biotinylated secondary antibody. The chromogen DAB was used to visualize the blood vessels (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Richardsson\u2019s stain was used to counterstain the rest of the tumor tissue. The cross-section of CD31 positive structures was quantified per mm2 of the entire tumor. The blood vessel diameter was also measured. The Computer-software program NIS-Elements AR 3.2 64-bit (Laboratory Imaging Ltd, Prague, Czech Republic) was used for this purpose. Also, for standard histologic examination of the tumor specimens, frozen sections from both HBOT tumors and controls were stained with Haematoxylin-Eosin.Ki67-stainingKi67-staining was carried out on 10 \u03bcm thick cryosections from the control group and the HBOT group. Sections were fixed for 8 minutes in 70% methanol and 30% acetone at -20\u00b0C, and further washed 3 x 10 min in PBS. Unspecific binding was blocked with Peroxidase Block from the Dako EnVision+ System-HRP (DAB+) kit (K4006, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 8 minutes, before washing the sections 2 min x 3 in PBS. The primary antibody, Monoclonal Mouse Anti-Human Ki67 (M7240, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), was diluted 1:75 in Antibody Diluent with Background Reducing Components (S3022, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and the sections were incubated 1 hr at RT. Thereafter, the sections were washed 5 min x 2 with PBS-T, and 5 min x 1 with PBS. The Peroxidase Labeled Polymer from the Dako EnVision+ System-HRP (DAB+) kit (K4006, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was applied and incubated for 30 min at RT, before washing 5 min x 2 with PBS-T. Liquid DAB+ Chromogen and buffer from the Dako EnVision+ System-HRP (DAB+) kit (K4006, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was mixed as described by manufacturer, and incubated on sections for 1 min and 50 sec. Sections were immediately washed in ddH2O for 3 min. Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain, with 3 min incubation prior to 3 min wash in 37\u00b0C running water. Sections were dehydrated for 10 sec in each bath in the following order; 75% ethanol, 96% ethanol, 96% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 100% ethanol, Xylol, Xylol. Finally, the sections were mounted with coverslips using Hecht KarlTM Assistent Histokitt (Fisher Scientific, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden). Images were captured and analysed using the Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, and the computer program NIS-Elements AR 3.2 64-bit (Laboratory Imaging Ltd, Prague, Czech Republic). Ki67 positive cells were counted as positive cells per mm2.Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of tissue sectionsIF staining was performed on cryosections of tissue samples from mice treated with or without HBO for 24 days (5 mice from each group). Sections with a thickness of 10 \u03bcm were fixed in methanol for 10 minutes at -20\u00b0C and then rehydrated in PBS (3x10 min). Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% goat serum diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the sections were incubated with primary antibody against integrin \u03b21, rat anti-mouse (Millipore MAB1997, dilution 1:400), rabbit anti-FSP1 antibody (Millipore 07\u20132274, dilution 1:400), rabbit anti-mouse collagen type I (Millipore AB765P, dilution 1:200), rabbit anti-human cytokeratin-7 (Novus Biologicals NBP1-30152, dilution 1:400) or mouse anti-human cytokeratin (clones AE1/AE3, Dako M3515, dilution 1:400) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After two washing steps with PBS/0.05% Tween and an additional washing step with PBS, the secondary antibodies were applied. Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 Goat Anti-Rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Cat.112-545-003, dilution 1:800) was used for integrin \u03b21, Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 Goat Anti-Rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Cat.111-585-144, dilution 1:800) was used for collagen type I or cytokeratin-7. The sections were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Sections stained with secondary antibody only were used as negative controls. After two washing steps in PBS/0.05% Tween, sections were mounted in ProLong\u00ae Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher P36935) and were dried overnight. Afterwards, the mounted sections were observed under a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope and photographed using a digital AxioCam mRM camera (Zeiss). Four to five sections from each tumor was used for analysis using the software program Image J (National Institite of Health, MD, USA).For IF staining to evaluate Axl RTK and N-cadherin, cryosections were air dried 40 min at room temperature (RT), and subsequently fixed in 3.7% formalin for 10 min, RT. Sections were washed 2 x 5 min with PBS, and incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, 4 min, RT. Following 2 x 5 min washes, sections were blocked with 5% goat serum, 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, RT. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies over night at 4\u00b0C; mouse anti human Axl (1H12, BerGenBio AS, dilution 1:150), rabbit anti human N-cadherin (Abcam, ab18203, 1:200). Following wash 3 x 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT; goat anti mouse-488 (A21131, Invitrogen/Molecular probes, dilution 1:200) and goat anti rabbit 647 (A21244, Invitrogen/Molecular probes, dilution 1:300). Sections were washed with Triton X-100 in PBS 3 x 10 min, dipped in water and mounted with ProLong Diamond antifade mounting medium with DAPI (P36962, Life technologies/Molecular Probes) and high precicion cover glass (No. 1014, Assistent). Images were obtained on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope system, equipped with a 63x HCX PL Apo Oil objective (Leica). A maximum projection snapshot of a 9 \u03bcm z-stack is shown. The confocal microscope is available through the molecular imaging centre (MIC), a core facility at the University of Bergen.MetastasisDevelopment of metastasic lesions was studied in a separate series of experiements. Mice were injected with 5 x 105 MDA-MB-231 cells and terminated at day 54 post-injection. The lungs were fixed post mortem using approximately 1 mL of Bouin\u2019s solution (Gurr BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, UK) injected into the trachea. The lungs were immediately dissected out, fixated in new Bouin\u2019s solution, washed in 70% ethanol, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. The liver and femur bone were removed and fixed in formalin immediately after sacrificing the animal. After fixation the bone was decalcified in 10% EDTA, pH 7.2, during a period of 5 weeks. Sections were stained with H & E staining and examined by light microscopy. In order to quantify lung metastasis, 4 coronal sections from both lungs from each animal were examined. Total number of metastasis per lung was counted, and the area per lung covered by metastasis was measured in mm2 (Nikon Digital Sight, Nikon Corporation).Western blotOn the last day of measurements the tumors were dissected out, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until further use. The MDA-MB-231 tumors were divided in two halves, and one was used for immunohistochemistry and the other to make the proteinlysate for western blot. Briefly, a cross section (approximately 50 mg) of tumor tissue was homogenized in denaturing lysis buffer (DLB), containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Trition X, complete EDTA free tablet and phosphatase inhibitor, with homogenizing beads in a tissue homogenizer (Precally\u00ae 24, Bertin Technologies, France) for 6,800-3x10-30 at 4\u00b0C and incubated on ice for 45 min. The lysate was removed and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C (Eppendorf 5415R, Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was collected, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. The protein concentration was determined by a BCA assay (PierceTM, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Equivalent concentrations were run on a 12% gel under reducing conditions with 50 mM DTT in sample buffer, and transferred using iBlotTM (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsberg, CA, USA) for 10 min. Membranes were blocked with I-block (Tropix\u00ae, Thermo Scientific, Bedford, USA) for 1 h and 30 min at RT. Rabbit anti-mouse E-cadherin (ab 53033, diluting factor 1:800) and rabbit anti-mouse N-cadherin (ab76057, diluting factor 1:1000) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used as primary antibodies and incubated over night at 4\u00b0C. Membranes were washed further for 3 x 5 min in TBS-T and incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP, ab97051, diluting factor 1:5000)(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 2 h at RT. Membranes were washed 2 x 5 min TBS-T and 1 x 5 min TBS before development with ECL substrate (Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate, Thermo Scientific, 32209) chemiluminescense was measured with Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+ (BIO-RAD). The ImageLab v5.2.1 (BIO-RAD) software was used for analysis and quantification of the results.Statistical analysisSigmaplot 12.5 (Systat Software inc) was used for statistical analysis. Either the unpaired two-tailed t-test, or the Mann-Whitney rank sum test, was used to analyze statistical differences between the two groups. One-way Anova for 5FU experiemenst followed by posthoc test was used. Results were accepted as statistically significant when p < 0.05.ResultsGrowth of different molecular subtypes of breast cancer during HBOTWe assessed the anti-tumorigenic activity of HBOT compared to control on mouse xenograft experiments using the triple negative MDA-MB-231 (n = 14) and triple positive BT-474 (n = 14) human breast cancer cell lines. The mice were exposed to either normal atmospheric pressure or given HBOT, and the tumor volume was measured every 3 days for 17 days. HBOT significantly (p<0.001) suppressed the tumor growth of both the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and triple positive BT-474 tumors during a treatment period of 17 days (24 days post injection) as indicated in Fig 1, panels A-B. The results demonstrated the inhibitory effect of HBOT on tumor growth to be independent of breast cancer subtypes indicating a shared oxygen dependent antitumor mechanism. The size of the MDA-MB-231 tumors were 692 \u00b1 106 mm2 and 461 \u00b1 55 mm2 in controls and HBOT mice respectively at day 53 (final day) in the separate metastatic study.Tumor growth.The effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on the growth of triple negative MDA-MB-231 (p<0.001) (A) and triple positive BT-474 (p<0.001) (B) tumors. Cells were injected subcutaneously in the mammary fat pad. Mice were treated with 2.5 bar pure oxygen, 90 min each time, every third day, during a period of 24 days (measurements started day 7 post injection) (closed circles) and compared to controls (open circles). Mean \u00b1 SEM. n = 7 in each group.HBOT significantly reduced the number of proliferating cellsKi67-staining, presented in Fig 2, revealed a significantly higher number of proliferating cells in the control group compared to the HBOT group, with an average of 363 (n = 4) and 28 (n = 3) positive cells per mm2, respectively (p = 0.0002) in the MDA-MB-231 group and an average of 80.8 (n = 4) and 33.6 (n = 4) positive cells per mm2, respectively (p = 0.0001) in the BT-474 group.Proliferation.Ki67-staining revealed a significantly higher number of proliferating cells in the control group compared to the HBOT group in both models (MDA-MB-231, * p = 0.0002. BT-474, * p = 0.0001). Scale bar 500 \u03bcm.HBOT did not affect tumor blood vessel density or diameterSince angiogenesis is known to greatly influence tumor growth, blood vessels were stained using rat anti-mouse CD31 as primary antibody. The average tumor blood vessel density and blood vessel diameter are given in Table 1. There was no statistically significant difference between the HBOT tumors and controls. Based on this, we conclude that the tumor growth suppression during HBOT is not attributed to any effect on angiogenesis in these human tumor xenograft models.Blood vessels.\u00a0\tMDA-MB-231\tBT-474\t \tControls\tHBO\tControls\tHBO\t \tPressure pO2\t1 bar\t2.5 bar\t1 bar\t2.5 bar\t \t% O2\t20\t100\t20\t100\t \tBlood vessels density (number/mm2)\t13.5 \u00b1 1.6\t12.4 \u00b1 1.8\t11.1 \u00b1 2.2\t13.1 \u00b1 4.5\t \tBlood vessel diameter (\u03bcm)\t7.3 \u00b1 1.7\t7.2 \u00b1 1.8\t12.0 \u00b1 6.1\t12.3 \u00b1 6.4\t \tBlood vessel density and diameter in MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 tumors in control and after hyperbaric oxygen treatment for 24 days. Means \u00b1 SD.HBOT does not enhance the 5FU efficacyTumor hypoxia is known to be connected to drug resistance and thus we investigated if hyperoxia might influence the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drug 5FU. As a stand-alone treatment, 5FU significantly reduced tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 model as expected. Nevertheless, HBOT did not potentiate the effect of 5FU in the present MDA-MB-231 model (Fig 3).5-Fluorouracil.The effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) (n = 10), the chemotherapeutic drug 5FU (1.5 mg/kg in 0.1 ml) (n = 10) or 5FU in combination with HBOT (n = 10) on growth of MDA-MB-231 human mammary tumors over a period of 17 days. *p<0.05.HBOT affects metastasisFew studies concerning the relationship between HBOT and metastasis exists due to an old perception that HBOT would potentiate metastasis via enhanced angiogenesis. Thus, to evaluate whether HBOT has an effect on the metastatic potential of triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors, H & E stained organ sections were evaluated. Macroscopic surface metastases were observed in all the lungs from both HBOT and control mice (Fig 4). However, there was a significant difference in the ability of primary tumor cells to metastasize to the lungs between the HBOT and controls (Fig 5). The number, as well as the area of the metastatic lesions were significantly reduced in the HBOT group (Fig 5, panels A-B). No metastatic lesions in liver nor bone were detected in either group at the time the experiements were terminated (54 days post injection).Metastases.A representative picture of the metastatic lung in the MDA-MB-231 tumor model 54 days post injection is shown.Lung metastases after hyperbaric oxygen treatment.The effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on the metastatic development of triple negative MBA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vivo after 54 days. 5 x 105 cells were injected in the mammary fat pad in the groin area. Mice were treated with 2.5 bar pure oxygen, 90 min each time, every third day starting 7 day post injection over a period of 54 days. Histomorphometric quantification of metastasis number (A) and area (B) in H&E stained lung sections of HBOT and controls is shown. Mean \u00b1 SD. *p<0.02. A representative lung section from one control (C) and HBOT (D) is shown.The effect of HBOT on Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) signallingEMT has been indicated to play an important role in the development of cancer and metastasis and thus the specific markers E-Cadherin and N-Cadherin were investigated using western blot. Immunoblots from MDA-MB-231 tumor lysates indicated a downregulated N-cadherin expression in HBOT tumors. The downregulated N-cadherin in HBOT tumors was confirmed by volume density data, and statistical analysis showed a significant difference (p<0.02) as indicated in Fig 5. Although there was a tendency of enhanced E-cadherin expression, there were no statistically significant expression differences between the two groups (Fig 6). Immunofluorescence of cryosections from HBOT and control tumors verified the downregulation of N-cadherin in the HBOT tumors, and further revealed that N-cadherin was mainly localized to the nucleus in the MDA-MB-231 tumors. Finally, the expression of Axl was significantly downregulated (Fig 6).Epithelial to mesenchymal transition after hyperbaric oxygen treatment.MDA-MB-231 tumors constitutively express E-cadherin (A) and N-cadherin (C) in western blot lysates in both groups. The expression of E-cadherin (B) and N-cadherin (D) when adjusted according to loading control (\u03b2-Actin) in control (n = 5 tumors) and HBOT (n = 5 tumors) is also shown. Mean \u00b1 SD. *p>0.05. Immunofluorescent staining of cryosections from HBOT and control MDA-MB-231 tumors confirm the reduced nuclear N-cadherin and also reveals a reduction in the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase Axl (E). Scalebar: 25\u03bcm.Effects of HBOT on collagen content and proportion of stroma versus tumor cellsAnalysis of immunoflouresent stained collagen type I fibrils in primary tumors, using Image J, revealed significant (p<0.001) reduced density in HBOT compared to controls as shown in Fig 7, panels A, C-D. Analysis of immunoflouresent stained Itgb1 did not show any differenes between controls and HBOT (B), neither did FSP1 as shown in S1 Fig. The amount of stroma versus tumor cells are also demonstrated in Fig 7, panels E-F, demonstrating significantly less cancer cells in the HBOT group compared to control.Collagen type I.The total amount of collagen type I quantified as percent of total area in both control (n = 5 tumors) and HBOT (n = 5 tumors) primary tumors (A) is shown. The total amount of ITGB1 as percent of total area in both control (n = 5 tumors) and HBOT (n = 5 tumors) primary tumors (B). A representative immunofluorescence (IF) staining picture from a control (C) and HBOT (D) tumor is shown. Green represents stroma cells (stained with antibody to mouse integrin-\u03b21) red represents collagen type I secreted by the stromal cells (stained with antibody to mouse collagen type I), and blue shows the nuclei stained with DAPI. Scale bar represents 100 \u03bcm. Representative IF pictures are also shown to illustrate the compostion/proportion of the tumor cells (red, stained with cytokeratin 7 antibody) and the stromal cells (green, stained with integrin \u03b21 antibody) from the control (E) and and HBOT (F) tumors, respectively. Scale bar represents 100 \u03bcm.DiscussionThe present study demonstrated a strong and similar primary tumor growth suppressing effect of HBOT (2.5 bar, 100% O2, a 90 min) in both triple negative and triple positive human breast cancer xenografts in mice during a period of 24 days post tumor cell injection, which is supported by a reduction in proliferation. There was however no change in angiogenesis, nor potentiating effect on the chemotherapeutic agent 5FU. The triple negative MDA-MB-231 model showed a significantly reduced number of metastasis, as well as a reduced area of the metastatic lesions following HBOT, with a concomitant reduction in the EMT marker N-Cadherin, Axl and collagen type I.Intratumoral hypoxia is known to have negative implications for breast cancer development and is associated with a more aggressive phenotype which potentiates growth, metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy. Hypoxia, via HIF-1a, causes translocation to the nucleus and increase the transcription of multiple genes associated with this aggressive behaviour. Thus, since HBOT enhanced the pO2 in tissues temporarily, and O2 is important for degrading HIF-1a, we expected reduction in tumor growth.HBOT is commonly used for treatments including wound healing, tissue regeneration as well as after radiation injury, to enhance the pO2 in the otherwise hypoxic tissue. The present study showed significant tumor growth suppression after HBOT in both the human MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 breast cancer model. Thus, enhanced oxygenation in the present study has been shown to induce a similar anti-cancer effect in both triple positive and triple negative breast cancers. This HBOT effect on tumor growth corresponds to what has previously been found in our laboratory in both chemically induced (DMBA) and murine 4T1 mammary tumors. Kluft et al. showed significant inhibition of transplanted mammary carcinomas in C57 black mice after HBOT, and a strong anti-proliferative effect on different mammary cancer cells has been shown in vitro. HBOT in the present study could confirm a strong anti-proliferating effect in both mammary models. Thus, HBOT seems to have a strong suppressive and/or inhibitory effect on mammary tumors in general.HIF-1a is a key oxygen-regulator of VEGF gene expression which is important for angiogenesis and thus tumor growth. Differences in tumor blood vessel density is therefore one possible cause for the differences in size between the controls and HBOT measured in MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 tumors. Although an anti-angiogenesis effect of HBOT has previously been found in other breast cancer models and gliomas in vivo, the blood vessel density and diameter was unchanged in the two human breast cancer models investigated in the present study. We therefore concluded that the anti-tumor effect found, in these two human breast tumor models after HBOT is not due to anti-angiogenesis. It could potentially be due to reduced proliferation of tumor cells, as shown in DMBA mammary tumors in vivo and in vitro in different mammary tumor cells after HBOT. This is also indicated by the proportion of stroma/tumor between the two groups in the present study and it could also be due to enhanced apoptosis as shown previously after HBOT.No potentiating effect on 5FUHBOT is used as an adjuvant treatment for various diseases and pathological conditions and it is shown to overcome hypoxia in tumors. HBOT has previously been demonstrated to enhance the effect of chemotherapeutics in different solid tumors. Thus, since conventional chemotherapy is the mainstay adjuvant systemic treatment for early triple negative patient, we investigated whether it it could be potentiated by HBOT. However, the combined HBOT and 5FU therapy caused approximately the same degree of tumor growth inhibition as HBOT alone in the present MDA-MB-231 model. Thus, HBOT did not potentiate the uptake nor enhance the effect of chemotherapy in the triple-positive MDA-MB-321 tumor model. This indicates that HBOT influences the effect of 5FU differently in different tumor models, for reasons currently unknown.MetastasisThere are only a few studies on HBOT and metastasis likely due to an old perception that it would facilitate tumor growth and spread. The present study on the very aggressive, highly metastatic, triple-negative MDA-MB-231 tumors showed a significant reduction in both number and area of metastasis after sixteen, 90 min HBOT at 2.5 ATA. This is in accordance with a study on triple negative 4T1 murine breast cancer showing a decrease in lung colonies after HBOT (2.8 ATA) and similarily in a study on rats (3 ATA) with intravenous tumor cell injection, where it was found a strong reduction in metastasis of the lung but no effect on tumor cells in the hind leg. They suggested that the response was due to a local oxygen effect in the lung. Reduction in metastasis has also been found after HBOT in the lungs after i.v. injection of mammary gland-derived carcinoma cells and in mice with murine LM8 osteosarcoma tumours after HBOT. Based on the above, we argue that it is important to re-evaluate the effect of HBOT on metastatic potential since it seems to have a strong suppressive effect on at least lung metastasis in different animal breast cancer models.Advanced stages of cancer is associated with extensive deposition of collagen, particular type I, in the ECM surrounding the tumor cells. Collagen I is the principal collagen subtype in breast cancer and a high collagen fiber density is associated with aggressive disease and stimulation of tumor cell migration. One reason for the reduced number and area of metastases after HBOT could therefore be the significant reduction in collagen I found after HBOT in the present study. Since there was no difference in Itgb1 nor in fibroblasts using FSP1 between control and HBOT we belive that the lower collagen production in HBOT tumor samples may be due to the ratio change of the collagen-producing stromal cell, like CAFs, rather than the change in total number of stromal cells. Hypoxia has been shown to be involved in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in different cancers in vivo. EMT is identified by epithelial cells changing their originally stable cobble-stone morphological appearance, their cell-cell adhesion properties and lack of motility to a more elongated shape with motile, invasive features. Tumor progression and invasion are associated with this enhanced capacity to promote extracellular matrix remodelling and thus migration. Cells with mesenchymal properties can be identified by the loss of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, and increased expression of key mesenchymal markers, such as N-Cadherin, Snail, Twist and Vimentin. Previously we have shown HBOT to induce total mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in DMBA tumors in rats indicating a shift towards a less aggressive phenotype. In the present MDA-MB-231 model, we found a significant reduction in N-cadherin after HBOT. In most types of cancer, high N-cadherin expression correlates with cell motility, invation and metastasis. Furthermore, N-cadherin was demonstrated to be localized to the nucleus in our experimental tumor model, and aberrant N-cadherin in the nucleus has been shown to be necessary for cell migration during EMT. And although nuclear localisation of N-cadherin has rarely been described in human solid tumors, it has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, a high expression of nuclear N-cadherin predicted a poorer survival in patients with late stage disease, and multivariate analysis showed nuclear N-cadherin to be an independent prognostic marker for NPC patients. We also demonstrated a reduction in the expression of Axl RTK in the HBOT tumors. Axl RTK has been correlated with poor outcome and drug resistance in a wide range of cancer types, and has been shown to be necessary for maintaining tumor EMT. Axl RTK has been shown to be upregulated in human breast cancer samples, and to be associated with a reduced patient survival. Furthermore, Axl RTK expression remained an independent negative prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis including basic prognostic factors, and a hazard ratio of 3.27 were detected between cases with high and low Axl expression. In an experimental tumor model, the authors demonstrated that Axl knockdown completely prevented the spread of highly metastatic breast carcinoma cells from the mammary gland to lymph nodes and several major organs and increased overall survival. Taken together, it is likely to assume based on the findings from our study that enhanced oxygen could be critically involved in MET transition of developing breast tumors, and also be implicated in the reduced metastatic potential observed after HBOT in the present study.ConclusionDespite the different behavior and prognosis of the triple positive and triple negative subtypes of breast cancer, the HBOT had a strong and similar primary tumor growth suppressive effect on both tumor types, indicating they share a common oxygen dependent anti-tumor mechanism. Furthermore, the triple negative model showed significantly reduced number and area of metastases after HBOT with a reduction in the EMT markers, N-cadherin, Axl and collagen type I. Thus, as hypoxia is a negative prognostic factor for breast cancer patients, hyperoxia may provide a favourable adjuvant therapeutic approach for breast cancer growth and progression which should be evaluated further.Supporting informationReferencesCancer treatment and survivorship statistics, 2016Gene expression patterns of breast carcinomas distinguish tumor subclasses with clinical implicationsTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceHypoxia-inducing factors as master regulators of stemness properties and altered metabolism of cancer- and metastasis-initiating cellsRegulation of the breast cancer stem cell phenotype by hypoxia-inducible factorsThe basics of epithelial-mesenchymal transitionHyperbaric oxygen therapy and cancer\u2014a reviewHyperoxia increases the uptake of 5-fluorouracil in mammary tumors independently of changes in interstitial fluid pressure and tumor stromaHyperoxia retards growth and induces apoptosis and loss of glands and blood vessels in DMBA-induced rat mammary tumorsHyperbaric oxygen alone or combined with 5-FU attenuates growth of DMBA-induced rat mammary tumorsGene expression in tumor cells and stroma in dsRed 4T1 tumors in eGFP-expressing mice with and without enhanced oxygenationHyperoxic treatment induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in a rat adenocarcinoma modelHypoxia-inducible factor 1 and breast cancer metastasisHIF-1 and human disease: one highly involved factorHyperbaric oxygen: its uses, mechanisms of action and outcomesA reduction in the interstitial fluid pressure per se, does not enhance the uptake of the small molecule weight compound 5-fluorouracil into 4T1 mammary tumoursHyperbaric oxygen inhibits benign and malignant human mammary epithelial cell proliferationAngiogenesis in cancer, vascular, rheumatoid and other diseaseHyperoxia retards growth and induces apoptosis, changes in vascular density and gene expression in transplanted gliomas in nude ratsHyperbaric oxygen as an adjunctive therapy in treatment of malignancies, including brain tumoursEvaluation of hyperbaric oxygen as a chemosensitizer in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer in xenografts in miceThe effect of hyperbaric oxygen on growth and chemosensitivity of metastatic prostate cancerSystemic chemotherapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin plus regional hyperthermia and hyperbaric oxygen treatment for non-small cell lung cancer with multiple pulmonary metastases: preliminary resultsHyperbaric oxygen as a chemotherapy adjuvant in the treatment of metastatic lung tumors in a rat modelLung metastatic load limitation with hyperbaric oxygenSuppression of rat tumor colonies in the lung by oxygen at high pressure is a local effectModification of lung tumor growth by hyperoxiaVascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor release in cultured trophoblast cells under different oxygen tensionsWhy the stroma matters in breast cancer: insights into breast cancer patient outcomes through the examination of stromal biomarkersCollagen\u2014a necessary accomplice in the metastatic processEstradiol, TGF-beta1 and hypoxia promote breast cancer stemness and EMT-mediated breast cancer migrationHypoxia inducible factor-1alpha-dependent epithelial to mesenchymal transition under hypoxic conditions in prostate cancer cellsTransitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states: acquisition of malignant and stem cell traitsEpithelial-mesenchymal transitions in tumour progressionHypoxia potentiates Notch signaling in breast cancer leading to decreased E-cadherin expression and increased cell migration and invasionThe role of Notch signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during development and tumor aggressivenessN-cadherin in the spotlight of cell-cell adhesion, differentiation, embryogenesis, invasion and signallingCadherin switching: essential for behavioral but not morphological changes during an epithelium-to-mesenchyme transitionNuclear expression of N-cadherin correlates with poor prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinomaAdaptive mechanisms of resistance to anti-neoplastic agentsGlobal phosphotyrosine survey in triple-negative breast cancer reveals activation of multiple tyrosine kinase signaling pathwaysAxl is an essential epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-induced regulator of breast cancer metastasis and patient survival"

Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

Tumor microenvironment is a whole system which includes tumor cells, stroma cells (such as, adipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, infiltrating immune cells) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the activated fibroblasts, which were named by Tlsty\u2019s group in the tissue of prostatic cancer in 1999, are the primary type of host cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were found in almost all solid tumor tissue (e.g. cancers of the colon, lung, liver, prostate, pancreas and gastric cancer), and play an assignable role in tumor development by cell-cell interaction or cross-talk with tumor cells through secreting growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, CAFs are thought to be \u201cthe dark side of coin\u201d in tumor development.In contrast to normal fibroblasts, CAFs have some of phenotypical and functional abnormality. These alterations of CAFs may be due to its stable gene expression changes. So, whole breast carcinomas stromal by microdissection were explored to analyze the gene expression profiling. These studies have led to new classifications and risk stratification of breast carcinomas into several molecular subtypes based on their gene expression signatures. The global gene expression in the stromal cells has also been shown to powerfully predict prognosis and treatment response. A variety of differences have been identified between breast carcinoma-associated stroma and its paired normal mammary stroma, primarily resulting in increased expression of cytokines (EGF, HGF PDGF, TLL-12, SSP-1, POSTN, CXCL-12, and CXCL14), extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (FBN1, FB2M, SPARC, ADRA2A and ADM) and proteases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-13). These factors were involved in cross-talk between stromal cells and tumor cells by directly or indirectly pattern to promote tumor cell proliferation, cell adhesion and invasion, ECM remodeling. Although, these studies give us the overall configuration of the tumor microenvironment, there are still poor on the role of each member in the tumor stroma, like CAFs, to contribute to the tumor development.Until most recently, the distinguishable features and gene expression profile of CAFs and NFs have been described in breast cancer by Bauer et al.. Their studies show that up-regulated WISP1, collagen type-X (COL10A) and TGF-\u03b2 isoforms in CAFs activate paracrine Wnt-1 signaling in human breast cancer cells or lead to abnormal ECM production in stroma separately. Loss of expression of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 may alter the hormonal milieu in breast carcinomas, and down-regulation of KLF4 participates in the differentiation of resting fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. However, there is still no systematic analysis of the intrinsic relationship between breast cancer CAFs function and its abnormal signaling pathway. The extreme complexity of breast cancer CAFs feature and its roles to tumor development are needed to be further investigated. Furthermore, whether these previous finding in CAFs derived from western country women are also existed in patients of other races.In light of these facts, the principal purpose of this work is to investigate the possible innate nature of biological and genetic heterogeneity between human breast CAFs versus matched NFs in Chinese women. We identified 824 differentially expressed genes: 809 of these were up-regulated, and 15 were down-regulated in CAFs, which included 8 cytokines. The abnormality of CAFs genes and its associated signaling pathways could be involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, signal transduction and protein transport, which were proved in CAFs of other tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we firstly discovered that the altered ATM signaling pathway, which was recently found related to reactive oxidative stress (ROS), is abnormally activation in the early stage of breast cancer. Cell cycle regulated signaling, such as P53 signaling pathway, RB tumor suppressor/checkpoint signaling, regulation of cell cycle progression by Plk3, Cdc25 and Chk1 regulatory pathway are identified to be changed in CAFs. A set of immune associated signaling are abnormality in CAFs, which include natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules. And more importantly, we found that CAFs would be able to promote breast cancer cell invasion under co-culture condition through up-regulated CCL18.Materials and MethodsTissue SamplesAll the human breast tumor tissues and its adjacent normal mammary tissues were collected at the time of surgical reaction at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. None of the patients received adjuvant therapy before surgery. Specimens used in this study were approved by the Ethics committees of Chongqing Medical University.Isolation and Culture of Primary FibroblastsTumor tissue and paired normal mammary tissues were washed 3 times with sterile PBS with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamycin). The tissues were minced with sterile scissors in a fresh sterile culture dish. After digestion with 0.1% collagenase type I (C0130, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 8\u201312 h, tissues were carefully pipetted up and down for a couple of times using culture medium. The mixtures were centrifuged and washed with DMEM to remove the fat and tissue debris. Then, the mammary tissues were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Australia) for about two days. Removed the suspending cells or tissue, the most adherent cells were fibroblasts. The primary fibroblasts isolated from tumor tissues were named \u201cCAFs\u201d, and from tumor paired normal tissues named \u201cNFs\u201d. Cell purity was identified by immunohistochemistry for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence staining for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP following the standard described process previously and manufacture\u2019s protocols. Briefly, cells were grown on cover slips for 24 hours and fixed within 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1% triton-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1\u2236150) for targeting fibronectin (F3648, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam Cambridge) and FAP (ab53066, Abcam Cambridge, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) at 4\u00b0C for overnight. After washing with PBS, cells were then stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1\u2236100, ZF-0311, Zhongshan Goldenbrdge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and DAPI. Immunofluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80 i microscope (Eclipse 80 i, Tokyo, Japan; magnification\u00d7100).MTT and Flow Cytometric AnalysisCell growth was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Cells were plated into 96-well plate at 5\u00d7103 cells per well in 200 \u00b5l of complete growth medium. Cell growth was measured every day. Incubating for the designed time, MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. After careful removal of the medium, 0.1 ml of isopropanol with 0.04 N of HCl was added to each well, and the plates were shaken on a rotator for 20 min at room temperature. The absorbance was recorded on an ultraviolet spectrophotometric reader at a wavelength of 570 nm. The independent experiments were repeated for five times.S-phase was analyzed by using laser scanning cytometry. Cells were processed by standard methods using propidium iodide staining of cell DNA as previously described. A minimum of 20,000 events was collected to maximize the statistical validity of the compartmental analysis. Triplicate independent experiments were done.Preparation of Conditioned MediumMDA-MB-231 cells, CAFs and NFs were cultured in complete growth DMEM for 48 h to approximately 80% confluence. The medium was changed to 0.5% FBS DMEM and cells were kept in culture for another 30 to 36 h. For neutralization experiments, neutralizing antibodies against human CXCL-12 (500 ng/ml), CCL18 (10 \u00b5g/ml), CCL4 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) and control IgG (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were separately preincubated at 37\u00b0C with supernatant for 1 h before performing migration assays. The medium was centrifuged at 1,200\u00d7g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM).Cell Migration and Invasion AssayCell invasion or migration assay was measured via modified Boyden chamber assay as described previously. Briefly, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 cells in 200 \u00b5l serum-free medium were seeded in the wells of 8 \u00b5m-pore membrance modified Boyden chambers (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) coated with ECM (1\u22367.5) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 10% FBS Medium, CM, CM with secreting factor CXCL-12 (100 nM), CCL18 (500 ng/ml) or CCL4 (100 nM) was separately added into the lower or upper chamber as the designed purpose. After 6 h or 12 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C and CO2 at 5%, cells adhered to the upper surface of the filter were removed using a cotton applicator. Stained with hematoxylin in methanol, the invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were counted. The data represent at least three experiments done in triplicate (mean\u00b1standard error).RNA Isolation, Quantitative Real-time PCR and Microarray AnalysisTotal RNA isolated from six paired CAFs and NFs using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA quantity was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometry. Probe synthesis and hybridization performed as the manufacture\u2019s instruction were used to probe the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (44 K; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data were generated after scanning by using an Agilent Scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.5 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The raw data were normalized using quantize normalization and then analyzed by GeneSpring GX v10.0 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Paired Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) was applied to identify differentially expressed mRNA in CAFs and NFs. SAM output was filtered by q\u200a=\u200a0.1. Heatmap.2 function (R v2.14.0, gplots package v2.9.0) was used to plot the scaled expression data of differentially expressed mRNAs.An additional two expression datasets (GSE20086 and GSE29270) on breast cancer associated fibroblasts were downloaded from the GEO website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The raw data of six matched CAFs and NFs in GSE20086 were normalized using the R package gcRMA, GCRMA normalized. The author\u2019s processed data of 15 matched CAFs and NFs in GSE29270 were used in next analysis. Paired SAM were also used to analysis the different expression genes in CAFs versus NFs. In cytokines analysis process, the genes at least fold change >1.5 with an estimated FDR<10% were considered as dysregulated genes.RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). To confirm the differential gene expression pattern revealed by microarray analysis, 9 of randomly selected genes (CDC6, FLI1, S100A9, CDK1, PLK1, MMP9, PECAM1, SHC2 and C9ORF135) were re-proved by qRT-PCR assay. Specific Real-time PCR primers for each of selected genes were listed as Table 1. qRT-PCR was performed by a Bio-Rad CFX Manager instrument (Applied Biosystems) at 94\u00b0C for 15 Sec, Tm\u00b0C for 20 Sec and at 65\u00b0C for 30 Sec using SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II (Takara, Dalian, China). GAPDH were used as internal control for normalizing different samples.Primer sequences for qRT-PCR.Gene\tForward 5\u2018\u20133'\tReverse 5\u2018\u20133'\tSize (bp)\t \tFN\tAACTTCCTGGTGCGTTACTCA\tTGTGCTCTCATGTTGTTCGT\t156\t \t\u03b1-SMA\tGAGGCACCCCTGAACCCCAA\tATCTCCAGAGTCCAGCACGA\t153\t \tFAP\tTGTTCCAGCAATGATAGCC\tCTGCTTTCTTCTATATGCTCC\t186\t \tCDC6\tCCAGGCACAGGCTACAATCAGT\tACACGAGGAGAACAGGTTACGG\t126\t \tS100A9\tGCACCCAGACACCCTGAACC\tACCCTCGTGCATCTTCTCGT\t211\t \tFLI1\tCCACCCTCTACAACACGGAA\tATGTTATTGCCCCAAGCTC\t166\t \tCDK1\tGGATCTACCATACCCATTGAC\tTGGCTACCACTTGACCTGT\t120\t \tPLK1\tAATTACATAGCTCCCGAGGTG\tAGCCAGAAGTAAAGAACTCGTC\t118\t \tMMP9\tTCCCTGGAGACCTGAGAACC\tGGCAAGTCTTCCGAGTAGTTT\t307\t \tPECAM1\tACTCAAATGATCCTGCGGTA\tACTTAACATTTTGGCATGGGA\t98\t \tSHC2\tGCACCTGTATGTCAACACCCA\tTCCTCAAAGGGTCGCATGTCA\t90\t \tC9ORF135\tTCCCATGGATAGCCTTGACA\tGTGCCAGGAATACACCAAC\t160\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \tCCL18\tCCGCCTCGTCTATACCTCC\tCACTTCTTATTGGGGTCAGC\t141\t \tCCL4\tTTCCTCGCAACTTTGTGGTA\tCAGGTCATACACGTACTCC\t140\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \t\nNote: FN, Fibronectin; \u03b1-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle actin; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; CDC6, cell division cycle 6 homolog; S100A9, S100 calcium binding protein A9; FLI1, Friend leukemia virus integration 1; CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; PLK1, polo-like kinase 1; MMP9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; PECAM1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule; SHC2, SHC transforming protein 2; C9ORF135, chromosome 9 open reading frame 135; CXCL12, chemokine ligand 12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1);CCL18, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18; CCL4, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4.ELISA AssaySupernatant from NFs or CAFs were harvested and subjected to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for measuring the immunoreactive levels of CXCL-12, CCL18 and CCL4 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the instructions as supplied by the manufacturer. The ELISA assay was carried out in duplicate in three separate experiments.Gene Ontology and Pathway AnalysisFor detection of significantly over-represented GO biological processes, the Onto-Express analysis tool was used and the permutated P-value cut-off was set below 0.05. The pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs was conducted through the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool and the significantly changed signaling pathways were selected based on P<0.01.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was done using SPSS standard version 13.0 software. Data was shown as means \u00b1 SD from at least three independent determinations. Significance of difference was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant differences.ResultsIsolation and Identification of CAFs and NFsCAFs and their paired NFs were successfully isolated from six primary breast carcinomas and from adjacent normal breast tissue. The primary fibroblasts were successfully cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Both CAFs and NFs could be grown for at least 10 passages. Both CAFs and NFs showed spindle-like morphology (Fig. 1A). But the senescence-like cell would be appeared when the cell culture was more than 6 passages (Data not shown).Characterization of fibroblasts isolated from human breast tissue samples.A. Representative cell morphology of CAFs and NFs. B. Identification of CAFs using fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, and CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP by immunofluorescence staining. C. The biomarker gene expression in CAFs and NFs was re-proved by qTR-PCR, and its relative fold change in CAFs and NFs was displayed. The CAFs and NFs are positive for fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP are high expression in CAFs (magnification 100\u00d7 (cell morphology); 200\u00d7 (Biomarker immunofluorescence staining).The purity of CAFs was identified by fibronectin, which is the fibroblast biomarkers, and CAFs-specific biomarkers including \u03b1-SMA and FAP, respectively. NF and CAFs were positive for fibronectin, more than 95% of CAFs were stained by \u03b1-SMA and FAP (Fig. 1B). These biomarker expression changes were reproved by qRT-PCR in 3 paired of CAFs and NF (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrated that the purified CAFs were isolated from tumor tissue.The Noticeable Heterogeneity of Proliferation, Migration and Invasion between CAFs and NFsThe cell growth assay revealed that CAFs were endowed a significantly growth rate than that of NFs in the same culture conditions (P<0.05; Fig. 2A). The percentage of cells in the S phases measured by flow cytometry was significantly higher in CAFs (33.3\u00b17.1, N>3) compared with NFs (6.6\u00b12.5, N>3) (P<0.05). These data suggested that CAFs had a stronger capacity for proliferation than their paired NFs (Fig. 2B\u2013C). Similarly, CAFs had strong potent ability of migration (Fig. 3A\u2013B) and invasion (Fig. 3C) than its paired NFs.Significant difference of proliferation between CAFs and NFs.A.

(**P<0.01), (magnification A. 100\u00d7; C. 200\u00d7).CAFs Stimulate Tumor Cell Growth, Migration and InvasionIn order to understand the interaction cross-talk of CAFs with tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, co-culture system was employed to display their role in the cell proliferation and invasion. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from NFs (NFs CM) and control, MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from CAFs (CAFs CM) had significant proliferation (P<0.05; Fig. 4A) assayed by cell growth curve. The proportion of MDA-MB-231 cells in the DNA synthesis (S) phase cultured in CAFs CM (29.8\u00b10.8, N\u200a=\u200a3) was obviously more than that in NFs CM (13.0\u00b12.2, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.01) and control (23.5\u00b11.4, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.05) (Fig. 4B\u2013C). Collectively these studies demonstrate that CAFs had a stronger capacity promoting tumor cell proliferation than their paired NFs in the breast tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the increasing cell invasion was found in the co-culture system of MDA-MB-231 cells with CAFs CM, as compared with the system containing NFs CM or control medium (Fig. 5A\u2013D).CAFs promote proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in co-culture system compared with NFs.A.

The histogram to show the average migrated cells each view (F). Data is representative of 5 views (**P<0.01), (magnification: A, B 100\u00d7; E 200\u00d7).To examine whether tumor cells play a role in the biologic behavior of fibroblasts in the stroma, the effect of MDA-MB-231 on the migration of CAFs and NFs was compared. As predicted, more migrated cells were tested in the co-culture of CAFs and CM from MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 5E\u2013F). These data indicated that different effects existed in the cross-talk of tumor cells and fibroblasts.Genes Differentially Expressed between CAFs and NFsTo reveal the essence of the heterogeneity of biologic characteristic between CAFs and NFs in the breast carcinoma microenvironment, gene expression profile was investigated by micro-array assay. Total RNA derived from six paired CAFs and NFs isolated from primary breast infiltrating ductal carcinomas of grade \u0399\u0399 were used in this analysis. Gene expression profiles of pooled CAFs and their pooled normal counterparts were obtained by microarray analysis using the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (Fig. 6A). A total of 25,206 probe sets (transcripts) were present in human breast carcinomas-derived fibroblasts relative to their normal controls. Compared with the expression profile of NFs, 809 up-regulated genes (0.9%) and only 15 down-regulated genes (0.45%) were detected in CAFs using an arbitrary cutoff line of signal log ratio of \u22651.8 or \u2264\u22121.8. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), cell division cycle 6 homolog (CDC6); Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1); S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), matrix metallo peptidase 9 (MMP9), and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) were predominantly over-expressed at high levels in CAFs whereas SHC transforming protein 2 (SHC2) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 135 (C9ORF135) were down-regulated with a high array intensity (Table S1 and Table S2).Gene heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs.A. HeatMap of gene expression data obtained by Agilent micro-arrays analysis from CAF and NF isolated from all six cases (BCa 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were subjected to unsupervised cluster analysis. B. The mRNA levels of 9 genes selected randomly were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C. Signaling pathway analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathway in CAFs vs. NFs.The up-regulated genes encoded for secreted proteins were mostly classified into groups of extracellular region, cell proliferation, and signal transducer activity (Table S3). To validate the microarray data, the expression level of 9 randomly selected genes including 7 of up-regulated genes and 2 of down-regulated genes were re-proved by qRT-PCR between CAFs and NFs (Fig. 6B). Compared with NFs, the expression pattern of all differentially expressed genes in CAFs detected by qRT-PCR was consistent with the microarray results.The Unanimity Heterogeneity of Biological Characteristics and Genes Expressed in CAFsMicroarray assay displayed that most genes up-regulated in CAFs have oncogenic function, including growth factors (FGF2, VEGFC, PDGFC, CASC5, and HGFAC), transcription regulators (MKX, RUNX3, ATAD2, FOXM1, and PTTG1), cell proliferation-associated genes (CENPF, PLK1, BUB1, KIF15, and CRIP1) and members of the Wnt signal pathway (WNT1, WNT5A, LRP6, TCF4, and GBP4). Several genes encoding secreted proteins, such as CCL18, CXCL12, MCM10, ADAMDEC1, MMP9, and S100A9 were also significantly up-regulated in CAFs (Table S3). All of these secreted proteins are able to induce cell proliferation, implying that CAFs play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells.Additionally, microarray results suggest that CAFs may facilitate invasion and metastasis of breast tumor cells. The data listing in Table S1 shows that CAFs promote tumor cell invasion mainly via two of mechanisms: (a) altering tumor microenvironment interactions (tumor-stroma and tumor-tumor) by increasing cell adhesion (PECAM1, ITGAX, CCL4, LPP, and SIGLEC8) and cell-cell interaction signaling (CCL18, DLGAP5, C1QA, STAB1, and TEK), and (b) promoting extracellular region degradation (LYZ, C1QB, MMP9, IGLL1, and IGHG1) surrounding tumor cells (Table S3).Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathways showed that CAFs enriched many serviceable signaling pathways in contrast to NFs in human breast cancer. Maximum change pathways in CAFs were cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathways associated with cell cycle. Compared with NFs, the cell cycle and DNA replication signal pathway in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times, respectively. The alteration of the ATM signaling pathway was absolute significantly. It was recently reported that the ATM signaling was activated under oxidative stress. Our preliminary data indicated that activated ATM signaling was in responsible for cell proliferation of fibroblasts (Data not shown). The change of other pathways was also assignable, such as DNA replication signal pathways, chemokine signaling pathways, PI3k signaling pathways, abnormal activated p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 6C). Herein, the heterogeneity of genes expressed between CAFs and NFs was consistent with their heterogeneity of biological characteristics.The Common Cytokines-CCL18 Obtained by Compared with Published Microarray DataTo compare the shared genes in current work with previous publication in breast cancer CAFs, the mRNA microarray data of breast cancer CAFs and its paired NFs stored in National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE20086 and GSE29270) were used. As shown in Fig. 7, the dysregulated genes of CAFs are 136 (M Bauer), 1339 (M Basik), and 1102 in current work, respectively. The shared dysregulated genes among each of these data were 12 (Bauer\u2019s data vs. Basik\u2019s data), 7 (Local data vs. Bauer\u2019s data), and 93 (Local data vs. Basik\u2019s data). These data indicate that high heterogeneity is indeed existed in the CAFs of breast cancer. The similarity was found for cytokines and chemokines genes in the CAFs. The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained in comparing the current data with Basik\u2019s microarray data.The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained by compared with published microarray data.The number of dysregulated difference genes and shared genes from current work and two other studies in breast cancer associated CAF versus paired NF was displayed in each group. Dysregulated Cytokines in each study were listed. Only the common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained compared local data with Basik\u2019s microarray data (GSE29270).CAFs Provide a Suitable Microenvironment for Tumor Cell InvasionImmune-related genes, including various chemokines (CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18), are also differentially expressed in CAFs (Fig. 6C and 8A). Chemokines secreted by stromal cells surrounding tumor tissue have been associated with tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis through cross-talk between tumor and stromal cells. To understand whether CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18 involving in the cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells, tumor cell invasion was analyzed in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231, or NFs and MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 8B and 8D, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 immunoneutralizing antibody in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 reduced tumor cell invasion by nearly 60%. However, Condition medium (CM) with neutralizing antibody CCL4 had no significantly affect on tumor cell invasion. On the other hand, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 ligand, not CCL4 ligand in the co-culture system of NFs and MDA-MB-231 enhanced transmigration of tumor cells by around 3-fold (Fig. 8C and 8E). Collectively, these studies indicate that the up-regulated chemokine genes in CAFs have contributed to suitable microenvironments for tumor cell invasion.CCL18 and CXCL12 secreted by CAFs promote tumor cell invasion in cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells.A. The mRNA levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. B. The protein expression levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by ELISA in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C-F. Transwell migration assays were used to determine the functional significance of cytokines secreted by CAFs on tumor invasion. Assays were conducted by using either immunoneutralizing antibody (C and E) or addition of ligands (D and F) in the co-culture system. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u200a=\u200a3 separate experiments (**P<0.01), (magnification 100\u00d7).DiscussionCancer-associated fibroblasts have been recognized for their impact on the carcinogenesis, promotion and progression of many carcinomas. Breast cancer is notoriously associated with tumor microenvironment stroma with activated fibroblasts. However, relatively little is known about the relationship of biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs in the stroma of human breast carcinoma. Herein, this study focused on the gene expression profile of human breast cancer-derived fibroblasts in order to reveal the molecular mechanism of how fibroblasts induce a favorable microenvironment to cancer development.CAFs had several pivotal biological characteristics compared with NFs in human breast cancer. Using the CAFs and its paired NFs isolated from breast cancer tissue, the proliferation, migration and invasion of CAFs themselves were memorably higher than that of NFs in breast cancer. And CAFs had the potential capacity for the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Furthermore, the invasion ability of CAFs and breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 could significantly be increased under the co-culture system of tumor cells and CAFs or NFs cells.In line with the finding of the biological difference between CAFs and NFs, the heterogeneity of genes expression profiles and signal pathways were highly consistent with the biological characteristics of CAFs and NFs. The huge heterogeneity of gene expression was found between CAFs and NFs (Table S1 and S2). For example, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and cancer susceptibility candidate 5 (CASC5) took part in the regulating proliferation of CAF itself and tumor cell.Compared with NFs, over-expressed genes in CAFs afford several interesting insights into the dynamics of the carcinoma microenvironment through the special GO Catalogue. The gene ontology and signaling pathway analysis showed that the cell cycle and cell cycle regulated signaling pathways in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times respectively, compared with NFs. Traditionally, p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were cancer suppressor gene, but p53 signaling pathway abnormal activated and over-expressed of BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATR in CAFs may involve in other function in the tumor microenvironment. Similarly, ATM signaling pathway and cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathway may be related to cell proliferation in response to oxidative stress, although they were in responds to DNA damage or DNA strand break in traditionally. These data demonstrated that the vigorous proliferation of CAFs than NFs by some special activated signal pathway. However, the details will be further study for our next work.Moreover, the different invasion capacity between CAFs and NFs may be supported by other sets of genes expression (e.g. FOXM1, MMP9, PTTG1, IGHG1, TM4SF19, S100A9, SDCBP) in the CAFs and NFs. Heterogeneity of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1) were involved in cancer invasion and migration. In breast cancer, the securin protein stability of PTTG1 was correlated with securin accumulation. Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (IGHG1) and transmembrane 4 L six family member 19 (TM4SF19) were related to tumor immune invasion mechanisms and then made the tumor cells immunity. S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9) has been revealed as the metastasis-inducing protein. Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP) was reported involving in cancer metastatic progression. These results support the function of fibroblasts in breast carcinoma to promote cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis.Furthermore, CAFs recruited numerous cells related with tumor angiogenesis, infiltration, which promoted the tumor invasion and metastasis, through secreted some special chemical chemotactic factors. For example, CXCL14 derived from CAFs in prostate cancer and SDF1/CXCL12 derived from CAFs in breast cancer called up macrophages, endothelial cells derived from bone marrow source, M2 mononuclear cells to the tumor tissue respectively, which assisted the tumor formation new blood and lymph vessels. Chemokine signaling pathway and PI3k signaling pathways enriched in CAFs also illustrated that CAFs could promote itself and the cancer cell invasion and migration. These studies suggest that a close and frequent crosstalk between the CAFs and tumor cells exists during tumor invasion and metastasis process.In addition, a set of signaling associated with immune response, activation or immune escape were found in this study. For example, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules are abnormality compared with NFs. Although, its roles in the microenvironment to promote tumorigenesis and/or development for breast carcinoma are keeping study, these finding in current work indicate that CAFs may involve in immune response and/or immune escape of tumor cell.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer associated fibroblasts: the dark side of the coinBreast cancer stem cells, cytokine networks, and the tumor microenvironmentBreast cancer\u2013one term, many entities?Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts promotes the proliferation of a lingual carcinoma cell line by secreting keratinocyte growth factorCancer-associated orthotopic myofibroblasts stimulates the motility of gastric carcinoma cellsRole of cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts in metastatic colon cancer to the liver and their expression profilesCasbas-Hernandez P, Fleming JM, Troester MA (2011) Gene Expression Analysis of In Vitro Cocultures to Study Interactions between Breast Epithelium and Stroma.

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. In panel a, the first column shows the distribution of lysosomes while the second column shows the merged image of lysosomes plus MTs. In panel b, the first, second, and third columns show the distribution of NPs, lysosomes, and merged image of lysosomes, MTs, and NPs, respectivelyQuantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular retention of GNPPEG-RGD. a Quantitative data representing percent of retention of NPs. The cells were first incubated with NPs over a time period of 24\u00a0h followed by another incubation for 24\u00a0h in fresh media to determine the extent of NP retention. b Redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell among two daughter cells during cell division. c Confocal images of HeLa (first row), FBs (second row), and CAFs (third row) displaying distribution of GNPs (first column; marked in red), MT network (second column, marked in green), and merged image (third column) corresponding to GNPs and MTs. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

        "content": "Salvicine is a novel DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor with potent anticancer activity. In present study, the effect of salvicine against metastasis is evaluated using human breast carcinoma orthotopic metastasis model and its mechanism is further investigated both in animal and cellular levels. The MDA-MB-435 orthotopic xenograft model was applied to detect the antimetastatic effect of salvicine. Potential target candidates were detected and analyzed by microarray technology. Candidates were verified and explored by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot. Salvicine activities on stress fiber formation, invasion, and membrane translocation were further investigated by immunofluorescence, invasion, and ultracentrifugal assays. Salvicine significantly reduced the lung metastatic foci of MDA-MB-435 orthotopic xenograft, without affecting primary tumor growth obviously. A comparison of gene expression profiles of primary tumors and lung metastatic focus between salvicine-treated and untreated groups using the CLOTECH Atlas human Cancer 1.2 cDNA microarray revealed that genes involved in tumor metastasis, particularly those closely related to cell adhesion and motility, were obviously down-regulated, including fibronectin, integrin alpha3, integrin beta3, integrin beta5, FAK, paxillin, and RhoC. Furthermore, salvicine significantly down-regulated RhoC at both mRNA and protein levels, greatly inhibited stress fiber formation and invasiveness of MDA-MB-435 cells, and markedly blocked translocation of both RhoA and RhoC from cytosol to membrane. The unique antimetastatic action of salvicine, particularly its specific modulation of cell motility in vivo and in vitro, is closely related to Rho-dependent signaling pathway.",

Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF-S1, CAF-S4) accumulate differentially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC).

By secreting CXCL12, CAF-S1 attracts CD4<sup+</supCD25<sup+</sup T lymphocytes and retains them by OX40L, PD-L2, and\u00a0JAM2. Moreover, CAF-S1 increases T lymphocyte survival and promotes their differentiation into CD25<supHigh</supFOXP3<supHigh</sup, through B7H3, CD73, and DPP4. Finally, in contrast to CAF-S4, CAF-S1 enhances the regulatory T\u00a0cell capacity to inhibit T effector proliferation.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) control multiple biological processes such as proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation of a variety of cell types. FGF signaling also plays a role in EMT and morphogenesis of mesoderm in mice at gastrulation by controlling Snail that inhibits E-cadherin expression. Thus FGF signaling is necessary to control a specification of mesodermal and endodermal fates through some of the genes involved in the EMT during development.Deregulation of FGF signaling in different types of cancer has been reported. In most cases FGF signaling is overactivated by constitutively active mutations of FGF receptors, gene amplifications, and autocrine and paracrine signaling. Aberrant FGF signaling promotes tumor development by directly regulating cancer cell proliferation, survival, and by promoting tumor angiogenesis.FGF1 is a prototypic member of the FGF family, which has been implicated in a range of physiological processes, including development; wound healing and cancer development. Ectopic expression of FGF1 in bladder carcinoma cells induces a mesenchymal phenotype correlated with the internalization of E-cadherin and the relocation of \u03b2-catenin from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Stimulation of the bladder cells with FGF1 induces a set of genes attributed to EMT induction and to proteolysis. FGF1 reverts TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in human and rat alveolar epithelial-like cell lines. The role of FGF1 and the molecular mechanisms by which FGF1-regulated EMT during cancer progression remain unsolved.Integrins are a family of cell adhesion receptors that recognize extracellular matrix ligands, cell surface molecules, and growth factors. Integrins are transmembrane \u03b1-\u03b2 heterodimers, and at least 18 \u03b1 and 8 \u03b2 subunits are known. In addition to mediating cell adhesion, integrins make transmembrane connections to the cytoskeleton and activate several intracellular signaling pathways. Integrin signaling and functions are dependent on crosstalk with other signaling pathways, especially growth factor signaling pathways, since integrins possess no enzymatic activity. Several integrins are upregulated by TGF-\u03b21 during the EMT process. It has been well established that integrins are involved in growth factor signaling through integrin-growth factor receptor crosstalk. We have previously demonstrated that FGF1 directly interacts with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and induces the FGF1-FGF receptor (FGFR)-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 ternary complex formation. This interaction is necessary for FGF1 functions including cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis.TGF-\u03b21 induces integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression and the enhanced expression of \u03b1v\u03b23 potentiates TGF-\u03b21-induced responses in lung fibroblasts. Also, integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 enhances TGF-\u03b2 pathway through T\u03b2R-II activation and enhances EMT in mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 induces metastatic phenotype in hepatocellular carcinoma by enhancing TGF-\u03b21 signaling. However, the precise role of \u03b1v\u03b23 in TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT has not been established.In this study we studied the effect of FGF on TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in mammary epithelial cells. In this model TGF-\u03b2 induces \u03b1v\u03b23 and FGF1 enhanced TGF-\u03b2-EMT. We demonstrate that direct binding of FGF1 to \u03b1v\u03b23 is required for the enhancing effect of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT. So the enhanced expression of \u03b1v\u03b23 is a critical component in the enhancing effect of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT. This represents a new model of growth factor-integrin crosstalk in EMT.Materials and MethodsCell Culture and TreatmentsMCF10A and MCF12A human mammary epithelial cell line, SK-BR-3 and ZR-75-30 breast cancer cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MCF10A and MCF12A cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 5% horse serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 10 \u03bcg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 1 ng/ml cholera toxin, 100 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone. SK-BR-3 cells stably knockdown integrin \u03b23 and ZR-75-30 cells that stably express integrin \u03b23 were cultured in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Experiments were performed when cells reached 50 to 60% confluence. Recombinant human TGF-\u03b21 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ) and reconstituted in water according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type FGF1 (WT) and mutant form FGF1 (R50E) were bacterially expressed and purified as described previously. FGFR inhibitor PD173074 and MEK inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Wako pure chemicals (Osaka, Japan) and dissolved in Me2SO (DMSO). To induce EMT, cells were starved for 8 to 16 h then stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 in serum-free medium and/or 50 ng/ml recombinant human FGF1 (WT or R50E) plus heparin (10 \u03bcg/ml) and additionally incubated for 48hous.Transient and Stable Transfection of Integrin \u03b23For transient gene silencing experiments, Mission siRNA oligonucleotides (Sigma) for the human integrin \u03b23 (catalog no. SASI_Hs01_00174219 and SASI_Hs01_00174221) were used. Mission siRNA universal negative control (Sigma) was used as a negative control. The siRNAs, 30 nM final concentration of each siRNA duplex, were transfected into MCF10A cells using the lipofectoamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 48 h gene silencing for Integrin \u03b1v and \u03b23, respectively, both target gene and control siRNA-treated cells were harvested and applied for Western blotting or flow cytometry.Stably transfectable anti-integrin \u03b23 short hairpin RNA plasmid was generated as follows. We synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotide chosen from The RNAi Consortium (TRC) shRNA library (Broad Institute) for integrin \u03b23 (Clone ID. TRCN0000003236). The shRNA segment was subcloned downstream of the human U6 promoter between restriction sites AgeI and EcoRI in the pLKO.1-TRC cloning vector (Addgene), which contains puromycin resistance marker. The scramble shRNA (Addgene) were used as negative control.For stable transfection of integrin \u03b23, pcDNA3.1-\u03b23 (Addgene) that contains neomycin resistance marker was used. Empty pcDNA3.1 vector was used as a negative control. The plasmids were transfected into SK-BR-3 cells for knock-down or ZR-75-30 cells for overexpressing using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and selected successful integration by puromycin or G418 for 10 days. For generation of clonal stable cell lines, single colonies were chosen and propagated in the presence of puromycin or G418 containing media, and expression of integrin \u03b23 was confirmed by Western blotting and dimerization of integrin \u03b1v and \u03b23 in ZR-75-30 cells was confirmed by flow cytometry using antibody LM609 that is specific to \u03b1v\u03b23 heterodimer.Three-Dimensional Culture Assays-MCF10A Cells Form Acini when Cultured on Matrigel In VitroThe constitute cells can establish apicobasal polarity and form a hollow sphere. MCF10A cells were seeded on glass cover slip coated with growth factor\u2013reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences), as described. Cells were cultured in assay medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2% horse serum, 10 \u03bcg/mL insulin, 1 ng/mL cholera toxin, 100 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone, 50 units/mL penicillin and 50 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) containing 5 ng/mL EGF and 2% growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Medium was changed every 4 days. After 2 weeks of incubation, acinar structures were formed on the Matrigel. Assay medium was replaces to DMEM/F12 containing 2% horse serum and 2% growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Then EMT was induced by 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 and 50 ng/ml recombinant human FGF1 (WT or R50E) for 4 days. The medium was changed once during period of stimulation.Western BlottingCells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan)). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The blots were proved with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (GE healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), and then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows. Rabbit anti-N-cadherin (YS) was Immuno-Biological Laboratories (Gunma, Japan); mouse anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7) was Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA); rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (137F5), rabbit anti-phospho ERK1/2 (D13.14.4E), rabbit anti-phospho Smad2, mouse anti-MMP9 (D603H), mouse anti-PAI-1 (D9C4) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); rabbit anti-FGFR1 (C-15), mouse anti-integrin \u03b23 (SAP), mouse-integrin \u03b1V (P2W7), mouse anti-GAPDH (0411) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti- FGFR2 was from Sigma; mouse anti-MMP2 (42-5D11) was from Daiichi fine chemical (Toyama, Japan). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed using ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html).Reverse Transcription Quantitative Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using Sepasol (Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan), cDNA was synthesized using AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequent quantitative real-time PCR was done in a Roche LightCycler-480 using SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Expressions were quantified using the following primers: N-cadherin 5\u2019-CCATCACTCGGCTTAATGGT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-ACCCACAATCCTGTCCACAT-3\u2019 and vimentin 5\u2019-GCCCTTAAAGGAACCAATG-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-CCTTCCAGCAGCTTCCTGTAG-3\u2019, Snail1 5\u2019- GGTTCTTCTGCGCTACTGCT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019- TAGGGCTGCTGGAAGGTAAA-3\u2019 and, Snail2 5\u2019- GCGATGCCCAGTCTAGAAAA-3\u2019 and 5\u2019- GCAGTGAGGGCAAGAAAAAG-3\u2019. Relative quantification of cDNA amounts was done using the data analysis function of the Roche Molecular Biochemicals Light Cycler Software (V. 3.5). Expression levels were calculated in relation to the expression level of \u03b2-Actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the reference genes. The primers for \u03b2-Actin were 5\u2019-CTCCTCCCTGGAGAAGAGCTACGA- 3\u2019 and 5\u2019-ATGATGGAGTTGAAGGTAGTTTCG- 3\u2019 and GAPDH were 5\u2019-CAATGACCCCTTCATTGACC-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG-3\u2019. For quantification using real-time reverse transcription-PCR, at least three independent experiments with triplicate amplifications were performed.ImmunofluorescenceCells were seeded and treated on coverslips. They were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes, washed twice with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 hour, cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence as follows. Mouse anti-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (LM609, Millipore), mouse anti-laminin-5 (D4B5, Millipore) and rat anti-integrin \u03b16 (GoH3, eBioscience). Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-mouse IgG FITC conjugated (GE healthcare) and donkey anti-rat IgG FITC conjugated (GE healthcare). Coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were taken by Nikon Eclipse TE2000E fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with digital camera.Flow CytometryFor flow cytometric detection of integrins, treated cells grown in culture dishes were harvested with Trypsin/EDTA and washed with PBS. After incubation in a primary antibody in 1% BSA in DMEM for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C, the cells were washed with 1% BSA in DMEM. Primary antibodies used in this assay were anti-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (LM609), anti-integrin \u03b21 (SG19), anti-integrin \u03b23 (SAP), anti-integrin \u03b12 (P1E6, Millipore), anti-integrin \u03b13 (P1B5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-integrin \u03b14 (SG73), anti-integrin \u03b15 (KH72), anti-integrin \u03b16 (GoH3) and anti-integrin \u03b19\u03b21 (Y9A2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Then cells were incubated in FITC conjugated secondary antibody in 1% BSA in DMEM. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) was done after additional washes in PBS at 4\u00b0C.Invasion AssayInvasion assays were done in Chemotaxicell inserts (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) with 8 \u03bcm polycarbonate filters coated with 100 \u03bcg/ml Growth factor reduced Matrigel for 3 h at 37\u00b0C and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were suspended in serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 105 cells in 200 \u03bcl and seeded in the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with 500 \u03bcl DMEM/F12 containing 0.1% BSA and 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 and/or 50 ng/ml recombinant human FGF1. Then, cells were allowed to migrate for 24 h. The upper side of the filters was wiped with cotton swabs, fixed, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Images were taken by digital camera and counted using cell counting function of Image J software.Gelatin ZymographyConditioned media were collected and concentrated using a Centricon (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Gelatinolytic activities were detected in SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed by incubating the gel with 2.5% Triton X-100 and gelatinase activity was revealed by overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C with incubation buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 5 mM CaCl2, 1 \u03bcM ZnCl2. Then the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.In Vitro Wound Healing AssayCells were allowed to grow in the culture medium for overnight in cell culture dishes. Then cells were washed with serum-free medium and starved for 8 h, and treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 and/or 50 ng/ml recombinant human FGF1 (WT or R50E) to induce EMT for 24 h. A scratch was made across the cell layer using a pipette tip. After washing with serum-free medium twice, cells were incubated in same conditioned as above for additional 24 h. Images were observed using phase-contrast inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with digital camera and the wounded areas were quantified by using ImageJ.Statistical AnalysisResults are presented as the mean \u00b1 S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Significant differences were defined as p < 0.05.ResultsFGF1 Enhances TGF-\u03b21-Induced EMT in Mammary Epithelial CellsWe studied the effect of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells. Serum-starved MCF10A cells were incubated for 48 h in serum-free medium containing TGF-\u03b21 with or without 50 ng/ml FGF1. EMT markers, N-cadherin, PAI-1 and vimentin levels were upregulated by TGF-\u03b21 in MCF10A cells. Interestingly, combined stimulation of TGF-\u03b21 plus FGF1 enhanced the protein and mRNA levels of these proteins (Fig 1A and 1B).FGF1 amplifies TGF\u03b2-1-induced EMT in mammary epithelial cells.Starved MCF10A cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml FGF1 for 48 h. A, Cell lysates were applied for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. GAPDH and total ERK1/2 were used as a loading control. B, Total RNA was extracted and revers transcribed to cDNA. N-cadherin and vimentin, Snail1 and Snail2 expressions were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. C, Cell lysates were applied for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. D, Matrigel invasion assay was performed on MCF10A cells following treatment with 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 in the presence or absence of FGF1. E, Conditioned media were applied for gelatin zymography and MMP2 activity were assessed by gelatin digestion in the gel. F, MCF12A cells were starved and treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml FGF1 for 48 h. Western blotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. Data represent the mean \u00b1 S.E. (n = 3; *, p < 0.05). Bands intensity was measured by densitometry.Despite E-cadherin is one of the markers of EMT, we did not detect the obvious E-cadherin downregulation by TGF-\u03b21 in this condition (Fig 1A). This is not surprising since 1) not all cell lines that have undergone EMT concomitantly lose E-cadherin expression, and 2) the E-cadherin expression is not sufficiently suppressed by TGF-\u03b21 within 48 h TGF-\u03b21 stimulation.It has been reported that TGF receptor and other tyrosine kinase receptors activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). TGF-\u03b21 activated-ERK phosphorylation was also enhanced by FGF1 (Fig 1A). When FGF1 was added after 24 h TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, we still observed synergistic effects on N-cadherin level and ERK phosphorylation (data not shown). This suggests that the effect of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT is not specific to 48 h incubation time.We tested the effect of FGF1 on MMP2 and MMP9, target genes of TGF-\u03b21. MMP9 was amplified by combined stimulation of TGF-\u03b21 and 50 ng/ml FGF1, while no significant change was detected in MMP2 expression (Fig 1C).EMT is also characterized by increased cell motility and invasiveness, key events in cancer metastasis. We examined whether FGF1 regulates TGF-\u03b21 induced cell invasion. MCF10A cells were cultured on Matrigel coated trans-well chamber for 24 h and invaded cells were counted. FGF1 enhanced the invasion of MCF10A cells into Matrigel when cells were treated with TGF-\u03b21 (Fig 1D). Furthermore, consistent with the result of the invasion assay, TGF-\u03b2 -induced MMP2 secretion was upregulated by FGF1 in gelatin zymography (Fig 1E). We used another normal mammary epithelial cell line, MCF12A, was used to study if the effect of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT is cell-specific. We obtained very similar results: N-cadherin and phosphorylated ERK were upregulated by combination of FGF1 plus TGF-\u03b21 (Fig 1F), suggesting that the effect of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT is not cell-specific. To rule out the effect of FGF1 is due to its effect on cell proliferation, we counted the cell number after 48 h stimulation with FGF, TGF-\u03b2, or FGF plus TGF-\u03b2. There was no difference among the cell numbers (data not shown), suggesting that the observed affects were not due to FGF1\u2019s effect on cell proliferation.Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 Is Markedly Upregulated by TGF-\u03b21We have previously reported that FGF1, integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and FGFR1 ternary complex formation is critical for FGF signaling such as motility, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is induced by TGF-\u03b21 in lung fibroblast cells and murine mammary gland cells. Hence, we reasoned that the enhancement effect of FGF1 is due to increased integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 levels.To address this question, we first studied which integrins are induced by TGF-\u03b21 in MCF10A cells. FACS analysis revealed that integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was the only integrin induced by TGF-\u03b21 among tested integrins (Fig 2A). We next determined the levels of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expressions by Western blotting. TGF-\u03b21 quickly and strongly induced integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (Fig 2B). We also studied the time-course of TGF- \u03b2 signaling. Interestingly, 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 induced both canonical Smad pathway and non-canonical MAP kinase pathway. Smad2 phosphorylation peaked at 3 h and gradually decreased until 48 h, while phosphorylated ERK peaked at 48 h after TGF-\u03b21 stimulation (Fig 2B). Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression on the cell surface was assessed by flow cytometer using anti-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 antibody (LM609). Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was induced by TGF-\u03b21 dose-dependently in MCF10A cells (Fig 2C). Similar results were obtained by immuno-staining analysis. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was localized to plasma membrane, and the level of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was much increased by TGF-\u03b21 (Fig 2D). To clarify the morphological changes of the EMT by the TGF, we included phase contrast images in Fig 2D lower panel. These results suggest that TGF-\u03b21 markedly induces \u03b1v\u03b23 in MCF10A cells.Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and FGFR1 are induced by TGF-\u03b21 in MCF10A cells.\nA, Starved MCF10A cells were stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 for 48 h. Cell surface expression of integrins were determined by FACS analysis using indicated antibodies. B, We performed time-course analysis of FGFR1, FGFR2, and integrin \u03b1v and \u03b23 expression by Western blotting. Starved MCF10A cells were stimulated with DMSO or TGF-\u03b21 (5 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods. Cell lysates were applied for Western blotting and proved with antibodies shown in figure. GAPDH was used as loading control. C, Dose-dependent effect of TGF-\u03b21 on integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was assessed by FACS flow cytometry. MCF10A cells were treated with the indicated concentration of TGF-\u03b21. D, Induction of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were stimulated with TGF-\u03b21 (0.5 or 5 ng/ml) for 48 h, and stained with anti-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 antibody (LM609) with FITC conjugated secondary antibody to visualize (upper). Lower panels indicate representative phase contrast images of TGF-\u03b21 stimulated cells. Scale bar = 20 \u03bcm.Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 Is Required for FGF1 to Enhance TGF-\u03b21-Induced EMTFGF1 directly interacts with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and induces the FGF1-FGF receptor (FGFR)-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 ternary complex formation, which is necessary for FGF1 functions. Gene silencing experiments of integrin \u03b23 were performed to test the role of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 on FGF1 and TGF-\u03b21-inducing cell motility. Integrin \u03b23 specific siRNAs effectively suppressed the gene expressions and suppressed TGF-\u03b21-induced N-cadherin expression, but no change was observed in control siRNA (Fig 3A). The knockdown of integrin \u03b23 decreased the effect of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b21-induced cell motility to baseline (Fig 3B). These results suggest that \u03b1v\u03b23 is required for mediating FGF1 function in TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT.Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is required for FGF1 to amplify TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT.\nA, MCF10A cells were transfected with siRNA designed to target integrin \u03b23 (si \u03b23#1 and si \u03b23#2). Non-targeting scramble siRNA (scr) is also transfected as a control. 24h post-transfection, cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 in the absence or presence of FGF1 (50 ng/ml) for 48h. Cells were then lysed, and protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting and probed with the indicated antibodies. B, MCF10A cells were transfected and treated same as above, confluent cells were then scratched by pipet tip, which allowed cells to migrate to the open space and cultured for additional 24h. Graph shows the fold change of closed wound area after 24 h. C, SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells stably transfected with shRNA for either integrin \u03b23 (sh \u03b23#5 and sh \u03b23#12) or non-targeting scramble shRNA (scr), then cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml FGF1 for 24h. Protein levels were determined by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. D, SK-BR-3 cells were transfected and treated same as above, confluent cells were scratched and cultured for additional 24h. Graph shows the fold change of closed wound area after 24 h. E, ZR-75-30 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with integrin \u03b23 expression vector or empty vector as a control, then cells were stimulated same as C. Protein levels were determined by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Data represent the mean \u00b1 S.E. (n = 3; *, p < 0.05). Bands intensity was measured by densitometry.To confirm the importance of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 to mediate FGF1 signaling in cancer cells, we establish stably knockdown of integrin \u03b23 into SK-BR-3-breast cancer cells, in which \u03b1v\u03b23 is moderately expressed. Consistent with transient knock down of integrin \u03b23 in MCF10A, its stable knockdown in SK-BR-3 cells suppressed FGF1-induced N-cadherin expression and the cell motility (Fig 3C and 3D). We overexpressed \u03b1v\u03b23 in ZR-75-30 cells, which hardly express \u03b1v\u03b23. Overexpression of \u03b1v\u03b23 in ZR-75-30 cells increased FGF1-induced N-cadherin expression (Fig 3E).These results suggest that \u03b1v\u03b23 is required for FGF1 function in TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT.Direct Interaction between FGF1 and Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 Is Necessary for the Effect of FGF1 on EMTWe have reported that an integrin-binding defective FGF1 mutant (Arg-50 to Glu, R50E) is defective in signaling functions. We evaluated the role of direct binding of FGF1 to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 in TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT using R50E. MCF10A cells were treated with TGF-\u03b21 in the absence or presence of WT-FGF1 or R50E. R50E did not increase N-cadherin, phosphorylated Smad2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels induced by 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 (Fig 4A). Interestingly, FGF1 enhanced TGF-\u03b21-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation. FGF1 alone does not induce Smad2 phosphorylation. If integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is induced by TGF-\u03b2, FGF1 signaling is coupled to \u03b1v\u03b23 signals and may increase Smad2 signaling.Integrin binding defective FGF1 mutant R50E is not able to enhance EMT.\nA, Starved MCF10A cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 in the presence of 50 ng/ml WT-FGF1 (WT) or integrin binding defective FGF1 mutant (R50E) for 48 h. Cell lysates were processed for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. ERK1/2 and GAPDH served as a loading control. B, Starved MCF10A cells were treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 in the presence of 50 ng/ml WT-FGF1 (WT) or integrin binding defective FGF1 mutant (R50E) for 24 h. Confluent cell monolayer was scratched by pipet tip and cultured additional 24 h in same conditions. Images were taken by phase-contrast microscopy and measured area of wound closure. Data represent the mean \u00b1 S.E. (n = 3; *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01). Bands intensity was measured by densitometry.Wound healing assay also demonstrated that R50E did not show any effect on wound healing increased by TGF-\u03b21 (Fig 4B). These findings suggest that the direct biding of FGF1 to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is crucial to the function of FGF1 to enhance TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT.TGF-\u03b21-Induced Loss of Polarity in 3D Culture of MCF10A Is Regulated by the Interaction between FGF1 and Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23Several oncogenes and excessive growth factors lead to disrupted mammary cell polarity in 3D sphere models. We tested the functional roles of interaction between FGF1 and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 in epithelial polarity using 3D culture of MCF10A cells. MCF10A cells were cultured on Matrigel to form acinus structure for 10 days, and then TGF-\u03b21, FGF1, or both are added to the culture for additional 10 days. Immunofluorescence staining showed that integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was not detected in non-treated MCF10A cells that form morphologically normal mammary acini with central lumen. When the cells were treated with 5 ng/ml of TGF-\u03b21, integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression was induced mainly in cytosol, and the polarized organization was disturbed with cell-filled lumen (Fig 5A upper panels). FGF1 increased TGF-\u03b21-induced depolarization of acinus structure at TGF-\u03b21 (Fig 5A middle panels). However, R50E did not alter TGF-\u03b21-induced depolarization (Fig 5A lower panels). Apicobasal polarization was detected by immunostaining for the \u03b16 integrin as a basal marker. As observed above, R50E did not alter TGF-\u03b21-induced depolarization (Fig 5B). We counted acini with a discontinuous basement membrane, namely collapsing polarized structure, based on integrin \u03b16 expression against multiple acini in each condition (Fig 5C). We conclude that FGF1 enhances TGF-\u03b2-induced depolarization of acini structure. Thus, direct interaction between FGF1 and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is required to exert amplification effects of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in MCF10A acinar structure.FGF1 augments TGF-\u03b21-induced loss of polarity depends on the interaction between FGF1 and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23.\nA and B, MCF10A cells were seeded on glass cover slip coated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel. After 2 weeks of incubation, acinar structures were formed on the Matrigel. Assay medium was replaces to DMEM/F12 containing 2% horse serum and 2% growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Then cells were treated for inducting EMT with 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 together with either 50 ng/ml WT-FGF1 (WT) or integrin binding defective FGF1 mutant (R50E) for 4 days. The acini were immunostained with an anti-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 (A, green) or an anti-integrin \u03b16 (B, green) antibody together with DAPI labels nuclei (blue). Confocal images were acquired at the center plane of the acinar structure. Scale bar = 50 \u03bcm. C, MCF10A cells were treated as in A, then acini indicating discontinuous basement membrane was counted from the images.ERK Activation Is Required for Enhancement of TGF-\u03b21-Induced EMT by FGF1We found that FGFR1 is up regulated by TGF-\u03b2 but not FGFR2. These findings are consistent with the previous report. PD173074, a selective inhibitor for FGFR, suppressed the effect of FGF1 on N-cadherin expression and ERK1/2 activation increased by TGF-\u03b21 (Fig 6A, lane 8), suggesting that FGFR1 is necessary for enhancing effect of FGF1 on the N-cadherin level and ERK activation.FGFR and ERK signaling is required for FGF1 to mediate TGF-\u03b21 induced EMT in MCF10A cells.\nA and B, Starved MCF10A cells were stimulated with 5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b21 and 50 ng/ml FGF1 in the presence of 1 \u03bcM PD173074 specific inhibitor of FGFR1 (A) or 10 \u03bcM U0126 specific inhibitor of MEK1 (B) for 48 h. DMSO was used as a solvent control for the chemicals. Cells were then lysed, and protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Bands intensity was measured by densitometry.It is well known that FGF1 and TGF-\u03b21 induce activation of the MAPK-signaling pathway in many cell types. To test if the MAPK pathway is involved in the effect of FGF1 on the TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT, we treated MCF10A cells with U0126, a selective inhibitor for MAPK extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK). The effect of FGF1 on N-cadherin expression and activation of ERK were significantly inhibited by U0126 (Fig 6B, lanes 8), indicating that the MAPK pathway is critical to transduce synergistic effect of FGF1 and TGF-\u03b21 on EMT. Interestingly, TGF-\u03b21-induced N-cadherin expression was suppressed by U0126 (Fig 6B, lanes 6), suggesting that TGF-\u03b21-induced N-cadherin expression may depend mainly on MAPK pathway in MCF10A cells.DiscussionIt has long been believed that integrins bind to extracellular matrix proteins, and growth factor receptors bind to growth factors, and the two separate signals are linked to one another in multiple steps in the pathway. In contrast to this model, we reported that FGF1 directly binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and induces the FGFR1-FGF1-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 ternary complex, and the interaction increases fibroblast and endothelial cell growth and motility.The present study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 markedly induced integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression, and blocking integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 by RNAi abrogated FGF1- and TGF-\u03b21-induced wound healing in MCF10A cells as well as in a breast cancer cell line that naturally expresses moderate level of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23. Thus, our findings suggest that integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression induced by TGF-\u03b21 is required for enhanced EMT in mammary epithelial cells. Particularly, we showed that direct integrin interaction with FGF1 is involved in the increasing effect of FGF-1 on TGF-\u03b21 signaling. Also, TGF-\u03b21 induced FGFR1 expression, consistent with a report. A specific inhibitor for FGFRs suppressed the enhancing effect of FGF1 on ERK activation and N-cadherin expression. These observations suggest that expression of \u03b1v\u03b23 and FGFR1 is required for the effect of FGF1 on TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT.Consistently, the integrin binding defective FGF1 mutant, R50E, did not augment TGF-\u03b21-induced morphological change, N-cadherin expression and cell motility in MCF10A cells. Thus, the direct binding FGF1 to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is important for upregulation of EMT. Thus \u03b1v\u03b23 acts as a co-receptor of FGF1 and that FGF1 induces \u03b1v\u03b23-FGF1-FGF1 ternary complex formation in TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT. If \u03b1v\u03b23 expression is not sufficient for FGF1 signaling, it is expected that FGF1 signaling is deficient. In our preliminary studies, \u03b1v\u03b23 expression was not enhanced when TGF-\u03b21 was used at low concentrations (0.5 ng/ml) in MCF-10A cells. We observed that exogenous FGF1 did not enhance EMT, but rather suppressed it (data not shown). This underscores the important role of \u03b1v\u03b23 in FGF signaling. Also, R50E appears to antagonize TGF-\u03b2 signaling. It is possible that FGF1 is required for TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and R50E may inhibit it. Since FGF1 (and R50E) bind to all of FGF receptor family members and R50E may inhibit possible contribution of other FGF family members to TGF- \u03b2 signaling. Further studies are needed to address this hypothesis.The MAP kinase cascade is major signaling pathway involved in FGFR and integrin mediated cell fate. We found that the combination of FGF and TGF-\u03b21 treatment resulted in more robust ERK activation compared to TGF-\u03b21 alone or FGF1 alone. The MEK inhibitor blocked the activation of ERK signaling and upregulation of N-cadherin protein level caused by TGF-\u03b21 and FGF1 combination. Similarly to the observation, TGF-\u03b21 and EGF-induced EMT requires MAP kinase pathway, but not PI3K, p38, JNK or AP-1 pathway. Our results show that stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 only induced ERK activity. Several reports suggest the possibilities that TGF-\u03b21 may induce autocrine FGF signaling, which can be inhibited by the FGFR inhibitor, and directly activate downstream of FGFR. This may explain why the effects of specific inhibitor for FGFR were partial. Further studies of the crosstalk between TGF-\u03b2 and FGF signaling by other methods will be needed to address these observations.Several groups report that growth factors such as EGF, PDGF, HB-EGF, and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) increase TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in different cell lines. These support our finding that synergistic effect of FGF1 and TGF-\u03b21 on EMT. We recently reported that IGF1 signaling requires direct IGF1 binding to integrins such as \u03b1v\u03b23 as in the case of FGF1. We propose that increased \u03b1v\u03b23 expression induced by TGF-\u03b21 also plays a role in the enhancing effect of IGF1 on TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT. On the other hand, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and FGF suppress TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in kidney cortex cells and alveolar epithelial-like cells. Thus, it is unclear how/why different growth factors induce opposite effects on TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT. In the case of FGF, the levels of \u03b1v\u03b23 (and perhaps other integrins) might determine whether or not FGF augments TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT, as described above. It would be interesting to study if the levels of integrin expression and integrin expression profiles may be critical factors in the effect of other growth factors on TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in different cell lines in future studies.In conclusion, the present study provides a new insight into the role of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 in the enhancing effect of FGF1 in TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT. We provides evidence that direct FGF1 binding to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is critical for the enhancing effect of TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT by FGF in mammary epithelial cells.ReferencesTGF-beta-induced

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer and associated with early metastasis, drug resistance, and poor patient survival. Fork head box M1 (FOXM1) is considered as an emerging molecular target due to its oncogenic role and high overexpression profile in 85% in TNBC. However, molecular mechanisms by which FOXM1 transcription factor mediate its oncogenic effects are not fully understood. Integrin \u03b21 is often upregulated in invasive breast cancers and associated with poor clinical outcome and shorter overall patient survival in TNBC. However, the mechanisms regulating integrin \u03b21 (ITGB1) gene expression have not been well elucidated. Normal breast epithelium (MCF10A) and TNBC cells (i.e., MDA-MB-231, BT-20 MDA-MB436) were used for the study. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based knockdown was used to inhibit Integrin \u03b21 gene (mRNA) and protein expressions, which are detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) and gene reporter (Luciferase) assays were used to demonstrate that FOXM1 transcription factor binds to the promoter of Integrin \u03b21 gene and drives its expression. We demonstrated that FOXM1 directly binds to the promoter of integrin \u03b21 gene and transcriptionally regulates its expression and activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in TNBC cells. Our study suggests that FOXM1 transcription factor regulates Integrin \u03b21 gene expression and that FOXM1/ Integrin-\u03b21/FAK axis may play an important role in the progression of TNBC.",

        "content": "The lung is one of the deadliest sites of breast cancer metastasis, particularly in patients with triple-negative (TN) disease. We hypothesized that the presence of a TN primary breast tumor induces changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and soluble components of the lung microenvironment that support metastatic behavior. SUM159 (TN) and MCF7 (luminal A) breast cancer cells were injected into mice, and primary breast tumors were established prior to assessing metastatic niche changes. We observed increased CD117<sup+</sup hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow of SUM159 mice versus MCF7 or control mice (<ip</i &lt; 0.05). Relative to mice bearing MCF7 tumors and non-tumor controls, mice bearing SUM159 tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of ECM proteins in the lung (fibronectin, tenascin-c and periostin), with similar changes observed in lung fibroblasts treated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) from TN breast cancer cells (<ip</i &lt; 0.05). Exposure to lung-conditioned media (LCM) from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased migration/proliferation of both SUM159 and MCF7 cells relative to the control (<ip</i &lt; 0.05). In contrast, LCM from MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice had no such effect.

We hypothesized that the presence of a TN primary breast tumor induces changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and soluble components of the lung microenvironment that support metastatic behavior. SUM159 (TN) and MCF7 (luminal A) breast cancer cells were injected into mice, and primary breast tumors were established prior to assessing metastatic niche changes. We observed increased CD117+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow of SUM159 mice versus MCF7 or control mice (p < 0.05). Relative to mice bearing MCF7 tumors and non-tumor controls, mice bearing SUM159 tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of ECM proteins in the lung (fibronectin, tenascin-c and periostin), with similar changes observed in lung fibroblasts treated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) from TN breast cancer cells (p < 0.05). Exposure to lung-conditioned media (LCM) from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased migration/proliferation of both SUM159 and MCF7 cells relative to the control (p < 0.05). In contrast, LCM from MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice had no such effect. LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice contained 16 unique proteins relative to other LCM conditions, including the metastasis-associated proteins CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. These findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.1. IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The SUM-159 human triple negative cell line was obtained from Asterand Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA) and was cultured in HAMS:F12 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone 1% HEPES. The MCF7 luminal A human breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 10% FBS. Cell lines were authenticated via third party testing (IDEXX BioAnalytics, Columbia, MO, USA) between October 2018 and October 2019. The MCF10A cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 5% FBS + 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was obtained from Dr. Ann Chambers (London Health Science Centre, London, Canada) and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS. The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

Furthermore, the American Cancer Society has identified breast cancer as the number one neoplasia in women in the United States. It is well established that both transformed epithelial cells and their associated stromal microenvironment are active contributors to the development of mammary and other epithelial cancers, and that stromal paracrine effects induce epithelial cell tumorigenic responses, such as increased proliferation and metastasis. In breast carcinomas, changes in the stroma include appearance of discontinuities in the basement membrane surrounding the growing tumor, immune responses, formation of new vessels, and a desmoplastic reaction that includes activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) and remodeling of their mesenchymal extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition, both direct and indirect interactions between cancer cells and the mesenchyme are responsible for triggering the activation of the tumor-associated stroma (e.g., desmoplasia), creating a permissive environment in support of tumor development and cell invasion.Plasticity of tumor-associated stroma consists of both molecular and topographical changes that result in part from altered amounts and availability of matrix-modification proteins such as proteases, which contribute to variations in organization and pliability (e.g., stiffness) of the ECM. As a result of these types of tumor-induced stromal modifications, the microenvironment differentially engages cell-matrix receptors like the integrins, which in turn alter cell responses such as cancer cell invasion. Moreover, topographical reorganization of the ECM, such as the presence of parallel oriented patterns of collagen fibers, facilitates local cell invasion. Regarding types of invasive strategies, investigators have proposed that single cell invasion could occur by either epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitioned movement or by an amoeboid-like strategy, and that collective cell invasion could involve micro- or macro-track cell formations, all of which depend on microenvironmental characteristics. Interestingly, it has also been proposed that tumor cells can transition between these invasive strategies in response to tumor-induced stromal plasticity.Integrins, which are trans-membrane adhesive receptors that are composed of heterodimeric subunits designated as alpha and beta, are responsible for perceiving and responding to changes in both the extracellular microenvironment and the inner cell by linking the ECM to the cytoskeleton. It has been suggested that beta1-integrins, which represent the largest integrin subfamily, play a central role in tumor cell responses that include invasion and metastasis. For example, beta-1 integrins, among others, have been implicated in the regulation of protein Kinase B (PKB) also known as Akt, which consecutively plays crucial roles in regulating breast cancer cell invasion. Furthermore, inhibition of beta-1 integrin has been shown to result in a change of invasive strategy.Due to the influence of the mesenchymal microenvironment on cancer invasion, much effort has been invested in developing 3D model systems that effectively mimic the in vivo microenvironmental settings. Since little is known about the direct effects that tumor-associated mesenchymal ECMs have on breast epithelial cell responses during tumor invasion, we have developed an in vivo-like 3D ECM system. In fact, the original system has recently been modified to allow the use of a variety of fibroblasts, which produce self-derived 3D matrices that mimic successive stages of tumor-induced stroma progression. For instance, 3D ECMs derived from NIH-3T3 fibroblasts resemble matrices obtained from primary fibroblasts isolated from primed or pre-disposed tumor-associated stroma, and hence are regarded as control or early 3D ECMs. Similarly, 3D ECMs obtained from primary fibroblasts harvested from tumor samples resemble late in vivo or activated (e.g., desmoplastic) stromal matrices, which present tumor-associated stromal characteristics such as the above-mentioned topographical parallel-organized patterns of ECM fibers. We believe that staged ECMs can be used as 3D substrates for epithelial cells in order to study tumor-associated ECM induced responses such as growth, cell morphology, and cell invasion. Consequently, in the first part of this study and as proof of principle, we tested the direct effects that in vivo-like control and tumor-associated mesenchymal 3D ECMs have on immortalized normal (MCF-10A), tumorigenic (estrogen receptor modified MCF-7,) and metastatic (MDA-MB-231) breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, we investigated the influences imparted by early (control) vs. late (tumor-associated) staged 3D ECMs on the regulation of both the morphological features and the invasive strategies of MDA-MB-231 cells through engagement of beta1-integrin and/or PI3K.MethodsCell lines and culture conditionsNIH-3T3 fibroblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA and pre-conditioned (using 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) for 3D matrix production as published. Primary tumor-associated fibroblasts were obtained as described, and used for a maximum of 8 passages. Breast epithelial MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231 cells were purchased from ATCC, while modified MCF-7 were a gift from Dr. V. Craig Jordan, FCCC Philadelphia, PA. Fibroblasts were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone, South Logan, UT), MCF-10As in high calcium DMEM with 5% horse serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), while MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 in RPMI-1640 (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) with 10% FBS. In addition, MCF-7 medium was complemented with 10 mM MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (NEAA, Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA), and with 10 ug/ml Bovine Pancreas Insulin from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All media were complemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.InhibitorsFunctional blocking anti beta1- integrin antibody, mAb13 used at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/ml, was a gift from Dr. Kenneth Yamada (NIH/NIDCR, Bethesda, MD). Wortmannin, used at either 10 or 50 nM, and both negative controls DMSO and purified Rat IgG were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).Production of fibroblast-derived 3D matrixMurine embryonic fibroblasts, NIH-3T3s, were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for a minimum of 20 passages before matrix production to overcome their normal contact growth inhibition. The resultant, pre-conditioned fibroblasts-derived 3D ECMs have been shown to be reminiscent of both in vivo and in vitro early stromal ECMs and are characterized, among others, by random organization of fibronectin fibers. Therefore, matrices derived from these fibroblasts are referred to in the manuscript as \"early\" or \"control\" matrices. On the other hand, \"tumor-associated matrices\" were obtained from one, out of four different fibroblastic cell lines, isolated from advanced (\"late\") two-staged chemical carcinogenic-induced murine squamous cell carcinomas.As previously published, the resultant \"late\" matrices are reminiscent of in vivo desmoplastic ECMs which are characterized, among others, by a parallel patterned matrix fiber organization. The above-mentioned \"control\" and \"tumor-associated\" fibroblasts were induced to secrete and organize their own in vivo-like 3D matrices as described. Briefly, 250,000 cells/ml were plated on chemically cross-linked gelatin and supplemented every 48 h with 50 \u03bcg/ml L-ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 5\u20137 days, 3D matrices were cleared from cellular components by treatment with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20 mM NH4OH (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Resultant 3D matrices were stored at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. Every batch of matrices was characterized for quality control; matrices needed to be thicker than 7 \u03bcm while both types of ECMs were required to display the fiber organization characteristics associated with in vivo ECMs (as mentioned above).Cell growth assayCell growth was evaluated using Alamar Blue (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 5,000 or 10,000 cells/well in 48- or 24-well plates and incubated for 24, 48 or 72 h prior to 10% (v/v) Alamar Blue treatment. After 4 h, changes in fluorescence (\u03bb = 535/595) were measured using a SpectraFluor Plus (Tecan, San Jose, CA) plate reader. Wells void of cells were used as negative controls. All experiments were performed a minimum of three times in triplicates.Western blot analysis1 \u00d7 105 cells were pre-incubated with inhibitor(s) or controls (see Inhibitors above) in their respective media and rotated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were cultured overnight in the assorted matrices and lysates were prepared as previously described. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE using Tris-glycine 8\u201316% gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Primary antibodies were: anti-GADPH (1:5000, Chemicon Int, Millipore, Bedford, MA), anti-E-cadherin (1:2000, Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA), anti-vimentin (1:3000, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-Akt (1:2000, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), anti-pAktS473 (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-FAK (1:2000, Upstate, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and anti-pFAKY397 (1:1000, Biosource, Camarillo, CA). Secondary antibodies were: goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse conjugated to IRDye800 and IRDye680 (1:15,000 LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) for infrared scanning.Cell invasion within fibroblast-derived 3D matricesAssays were conducted as previously described, with minor modifications. Briefly, 12 well plates containing assorted 3D matrices were used and 8,000 MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured overnight in the presence or the absence of inhibitors or respective negative controls (for details see Inhibitors above). Fresh medium containing 25 mM HEPES buffer was added, and cells were allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Using a motorized XYZ stage (Optical Apparatus Co., Ardmore, PA), five random acquisition points were pre-determined for each experimental well. Low throughput movies were created where each pre-set location was photographed every 10 min for a period of 6 h using an environmentally controlled Nikon TE-2000U wide field inverted microscope (Optical Apparatus Co., Ardmore, PA) with a Roper Scientific Cool Snap HQ camera rendering 5 time-lapse movies per well for a total of 60 movies per experimental plate. Non-dividing and non-clustered cells that remained within the field of view for the entire 6 h period were tracked using the \"tracking objects\" function in MetaMorph offline 7.0r4. The software rendered a set of 37 X,Y coordinates per recorded cell representing the location of the cell at every 10 minute time segment. These data sets were transferred to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that were designed to automatically determine velocities (microns per hour), directionality, relative track orientation and trajectory length for each cell (see details below). All experiments were performed a minimum of two times in duplicates rendering no less than 10 movies per condition tested.Directionality assayTo evaluate the directionality of cells, trajectory angles of each cell with respect to the X axis were determined at 10 minute intervals. Angle values were obtained using the \"Tracking objects\" function of the MetaMorph software. This measurement rendered an average of 36 directional angles per cell, from which the mode angle (most common angle) was identified. Next, individual angles were rounded to the nearest 5th degree, and compared to the identified mode angle. The experimental output per cell was determined as the percentage of angles that were within 5 degrees from the identified mode.Relative track orientation assayThe angle between the cell-track and the X-axis was determined based on X,Y coordinates obtained from MetaMorph software, resulting in a single angle per cell-trajectory. The resultant cell-track angles for each movie were rounded to the nearest 20th degree in order to identify a mode (most common) angle per movie. In order to normalize the data, all modes were arbitrarily set as 0\u00b0, and the original tracks (per-movie) were rotated accordingly. The rotated track angles were rounded (de novo), to the 10th degree. Movies in which no mode angle could be calculated were not rotated. In addition, only movies containing more than three cells were included in the study. Numbers indicating the percentages of cell-track angles within 20\u00b0 from the mode (most common) angle per experimental condition, as well as total counts, were used to create the corresponding figures and tables presented.Cell morphology analysisThe assay was conducted as described, with minor modifications. In short, the first image from each time-lapse series acquired above (see Cell invasion within fibroblast-derived 3D matrices) was used for this assay. Cell contours were manually traced by a blinded individual and recognized by MetaMorph 7.0r4 software using \"automatic threshold light objects\" function. The resultant objects were then subjected to \"integrated morphometry analysis\" to obtain \"elliptical form factor\" (EFF) measurements. EFF is defined by the ratio of the \"length\" (long axis) over \"breath\" (short axis) of the cell; round objects present EFF = 1 while EFF > 1 represent spindled morphologies. All experiments were performed a minimum of two times, in duplicates rendering no less than 10 images (1 per movie) per condition tested.Statistical analysesAll statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney test and calculated by the Instat Statistical Software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).ResultsStaged fibroblast-derived 3D ECMs do not impart a preferential growth environment to normal or tumorigenic breast epithelial cellsTo test whether our stromal staged mesenchymal ECMs induce breast epithelial cell growth, we cultured MCF-10A, MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells in 2D conditions, control (resembling early) or tumor-associated (resembling late) 3D ECMs and quantitatively measured their growth rates during a period of 3 days. Our measurements showed that MCF-10A had a small, yet highly significant, preference to grow on 2D conditions compared to control 3D ECMs (1.1 fold, with P < 0.0001) or tumor-associated 3D ECMs (1.3 fold, P < 0.0001). The differences in growth rates on the 3D matrices were also highly significant (P < 0.0001). In contrast, tumorigenic MCF-7 and invasive MDA-MB-231 cells showed no significant differences in their growth rates under all conditions tested (Figure 1a). These results suggested that fibroblast-derived 3D ECMs differentially regulate the growth rates of some, but not all, epithelial cells.MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 exhibit different cell behaviors in response to culturing on 2D or in staged 3D ECMs. The stated cells were cultured on 2D (2D Ctrl), within 3D control (3D Ctrl), or within tumor-associated 3D ECMs (3D TA). a. Growth rates were calculated every 24 h for a period of 72 h. Note that 3D ECMs appear to be growth inhibitory only in MCF-10A cells with slower growth rates induced by tumor-associated 3D matrices. b. phase contrast transmitted light micrographs depicting changes in cell morphologies of the various cell lines in response to the 2D and 3D substrates are shown; scale bar represents 75 \u03bcm. c. Western blot of lysates obtained from the various cell lines cultured in the assorted substrates showing expressions of epithelial marker E-cadherin (E-cad), mesenchymal marker vimentin and loading control glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Note that the 3D ECMs did not alter the original epithelial or mesenchymal characteristics of the assorted cells.Effects of staged 3D ECMs in breast epithelial cell morphologiesSince different cell morphologies have been associated with many tumorigenic characteristics and with a variety of invasive strategies, we proceeded to ask whether staged 3D matrices could differentially influence breast epithelial cellular morphologies. MCF-10A, MCF-7 or MDA-MD-231 cells were cultured overnight on 2D, within 3D control, or within tumor-associated 3D ECMs, and their morphologies were perceptibly assessed using transmitted light microscopy. While cell morphologies were similar on 2D cultures, Figure 1b shows that all cells presented altered morphologies when comparing 2D vs. 3D substrates. Interestingly, while both MCF-10A and MCF-7 seemed to aggregate in cell clusters within 3D microenvironments, their morphologies were very different; MCF-10A became spindle-like, while MCF-7 presented relatively rounded and less spread morphology. In comparison, tumorigenic and invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, adopted spindled morphology in both staged 3D ECMs, as expected from these invasive mesenchymal-like cells. Moreover, matrix-induced morphologies of these epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitioned cells appeared to be enhanced (more spindled) within tumor-associated 3D ECMs when compared to 3D control (see measurements below). It is important to note that in addition to the spindled morphology, MDA-MB-231 cells remained unclustered as opposed to the other two cell lines tested.The epithelial or mesenchymal nature of MCF-10A and MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 and the fact that 3D matrices do not affect their epithelial vs. mesenchymal characteristics were confirmed by Western blot analyses using epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal marker vimentin (Figure 1c).Staged 3D matrices effectively support single-cell MDA-MB-231 and clustered-cell MCF-10A invasionReal time motility (on control 2D), as well as invasive (within staged fibroblast-derived 3D matrices) 6 h period assays, were used to observe correlations between invasive behaviors and substrate-induced morphologies of the cells used in this study. MCF-10As were observed to be motile, on 2D control, and invasive, in both staged 3D ECMs. In addition, although all cells were seeded as individual cells, MCF-10As seemed to cluster and invade through the staged 3D matrices as aggregates or groups consisting of several cells (Additional file 1; Movie 1). In comparison to MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were not very motile under 2D conditions (see Additional files 2 and 3; Movies 2 and 3). However, while both MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells clustered in 3D matrices, MCF-7 did not present any invasive characteristics (Additional file 2; Movie 2). Alternatively, epithelial to mesenchymal transitioned MDA-MB-231 cells presented apparent mesenchymal-like invasive behaviors (e.g., relatively directional cell movement through 3D matrices, see Additional file 3; Movie 3 plus measurements below). These results imply that matrix-induced cell morphologies could be suggestive of breast cancer cell invasive occurrence (compare Figure 1b with Additional files 1, 2 and 3; Movies 1\u20133).Tumor-associated 3D matrix supports sustained Akt/PKB activity regulated by both PI3K and beta1-integrinSince the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB, has been associated with both matrix induced cell survival and invasion, matrix-induced Akt/PKB activity levels were tested. For this, MCF-10A, MCF-7 or MDA-MD-231 were cultured on 2D conditions, or within staged 3D ECMs for a period of 18h. Cells were lysed and levels of active (pAktS473) and total Akt/PKB (tAkt) protein populations were assessed using Western blot analyses (Figure 2a). In control, compared to tumor-associated 3D ECMs, constitutive Akt/PKB (pAkt S473/tAkt) activity levels in MCF-10A and MCF-7 were either down regulated or remained unchanged (O.D = 0.5 and. 0.3 vs. 1.3 and 1.2, respectively), while these levels were clearly up-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells (O.D = 0.8 and 2.8). These results suggested that tumor-associated 3D matrices, but not 3D controls, constitutively activated Akt/PKB in MDA-MB-231 but not in MCF-10A or MCF-7 cells.Tumor-associated 3D matrix induced Akt/PKB activity in MDA-MB-231 is regulated by both PI3K and beta-1 integrin. a. Representative Western blot showing levels of pAktS473 (pAkt), total Akt (tAkt), and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), used as endogenous protein loading control, in lysates from MCF10A, MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cultured on 2D or within staged 3D ECMs. Specific Akt/PKB activity was calculated as the ratio of the scanned optical density (O.D.) of pAktS473/totalAkt (p/tAkt O.D.). The calculated activity ratios were normalized to ratios obtained for each cell line cultured on 2D control conditions and were individually assigned as one arbitrary unit. Note that tumor-associated 3D matrix induces high specific Akt/PKB activity levels in MDA-MB-231 but not in MCF-10A or MCF-7 cells. b. Lysates from MDA-MB-231 cells cultured on 2D or in staged 3D ECMs in the presence and/or absence of 10 and 50 nM Wortmannin (Wt10 and Wt50) and/or 50 \u03bcg/ml mAb13 (mAb13) were proved by Western immunoblotting using antibodies against pFAKY397 (pFAK), total FAK (tFAK), pAKTS473 (pAkt), total Akt (tAKT) and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The percentages of inhibition of FAK (%inh FAK) and Akt/PKB (%inh Akt) activities are shown and were calculated using the corresponding O.D. ratios: pFAKY397/totalFAK and pAktS473/totalAkt. Note that while Wortmannin inhibited Akt/PKB activity, mAb13, alone or in combination with Wortmannin, inhibited both FAK and Akt/PKB activities.Next, tumor-associated 3D matrix induced pathways responsible for the observed constitutive activity of Akt/PKB in MDA-MB-231 cells were analyzed. Since Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and beta1-integrin pathways have been associated with increased levels of Akt/PKB activities, these two Akt/PKB regulators were selectively and/or collectively inhibited while levels of Akt/PKB activity, and of beta1-integrin effector, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), were assessed. Untreated 2D conditions were used for normalization purposes and assigned a value of one arbitrary unit. Results show that PI3K inhibitor, Wortmannin, effectively inhibited Akt/PKB activity, while anti beta1-integrin functional blocking antibody, mAb13, inhibited both Akt/PKB and FAK activities induced by the two staged 3D ECMs. A representative Western blot with indicated percentages of FAK and Akt/PKB inhibitions is displayed in Figure 2b. In addition, Figure 2b shows that both FAK and Akt/PKB activities were also effectively inhibited when combination treatments of Wortmannin and mAb13 were used. Consequently, both Wortmannin and mAb13 were used to analyze a variety of staged matrix-induced cell responses such as cell morphology and various aspects of cell invasion (e.g., velocity, directionality and relative track orientation) in the second part of this study.PI3K and beta1-integrin differentially regulate staged 3D matrix-induced MDA-MB-231 spindled morphologiesTo better understand tumor-associated induced invasive breast cancer cell responses, the morphological features of MDA-MB-231 cells in control (early) vs. tumor-associated (late) 3D ECM under PI3K, and/or beta1-integrin inhibition were quantified. For this, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated overnight within staged 3D ECMs in the presence or absence of Wortmannin and/or mAb13 (DMSO and/or rat antibody were used as negative controls; see Methods for details). As expected, results shown in Figure 3 and quantified in Table 1 confirmed that increased spindled morphologies, measured as median elliptical form factor (mEFF), were indeed observed in tumor-associated when compared to control 3D ECMs (mEFF = 2.2 and 1.7, respectively) while Table 2 showed that this increase was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Moreover, in control 3D matrices, 10 and 50 nM concentrations of PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin show mEFF ratios of 1.5 vs. 1.4, which were statistically lower than mEFF ratios in untreated 3D control (P = 0.0016 and < 0.0001, respectively), yet not significantly different from each other (P = 0.1902). In contrast, in tumor-associated 3D ECMs, low concentrations of Wortmannin appeared to have no effect (mEFF = 2.3 with P = 0.5975) while higher concentrations were needed to attain significant inhibitory mEFF ratios (mEFF = 1.6 with P < 0.0001) when compared to untreated control. Interestingly, blocking of beta1-integrin function by treating cells with mAb13, showed a more effective inhibition of mEFF ratios in tumor-associated (36% inhibition) than in control 3D ECMs (18% inhibition), reaching 1.4 mEFF ratios with statistical P values smaller than 0.0001 in both cases. On the other hand, 50 nM Wortmannin and mAb13 showed no significant differences (mEFF = 1.4 with P = 0.2022) when compared to each other in control 3D ECMs. The effects of these treatments were modest (mEFF = 1.6 and 1.4, respectively) yet still significantly different from each other (P = 0.0005) in tumor-associated 3D ECMs. Since the most effective mEFF inhibitory effects were attained when both PI3K and beta1-integrin were blocked simultaneously, results suggested that both pathways played a role in regulating 3D matrix induced cell morphologies. However, results also suggested that while beta1-integrin more effectively regulated tumor-associated 3D matrix induced MDA-MB-231 spindled morphologies, control 3D matrix-induced morphology seemed to be more sensitive to PI3K inhibition.3D matrix induced morphology measurements; EFF \u00b1substrate\t2D\tcontrol 3D\ttumor-associated 3D\t \ttreatment\tCtrl\tCtrl\tWt 10 nM\tWt 50 nM\tmAb13\tmAb13 +Wt 10 nM\tmAb13 +Wt 50 nM\tCtrl\tWt 10 nM\tWt 50 nM\tmAb13\tmAb13 +Wt 10 nM\tmAb13 +Wt 50 nM\t \tMedian (mEFF)\t1.5\t1.7\t1.5\t1.4\t1.4\t1.3\t1.3\t2.2\t2.3\t1.6\t1.4\t1.4\t1.3\t \t\t \tSample Size\t172\t251\t192\t294\t173\t130\t221\t292\t210\t290\t206\t181\t248\t \t\t \tStd.

MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured overnight on 2D or within staged 3D ECMs, control and tumor-associated matrices, in the presence and/or absence of 10 and 50 nM Wortmannin and/or 50 \u03bcg/ml mAb13. a.

Note that median EFF increases in response to tumor-associated 3D ECMs, and that these EFFs can be inhibited by high Wortmannin or mAb13 treatments while combinations of both inhibitors seemed to inhibit better than each of these alone. See Table 1 for detailed quantitative data, Table 2 for statistical information and Additional Files 4, 5 and 6 (Movies 4\u20136) for additional examples.PI3K and beta1-integrin differentially regulate staged 3D matrix induced velocity, directionality and relative track orientation in MDA-MB-231 cellsNext, we decided to analyze the staged 3D matrix induced invasive characteristics of MDA-MB-231 cells while questioning the roles that PI3K and beta1-integrin play in these invasive behaviors. Three different aspects of staged 3D matrix induced single cell invasion, velocity, directionality and relative track orientation, were measured in response to the presence or absence of PI3K and beta1-integrin inhibitors (Wortmannin and/or mAb13, respectively). For this, six-hour time-lapse videos were created in a semi-high throughput manner thus simultaneously recording the cell's motile behaviors in response to the various experimental settings (see Methods). Additional files 4, 5 and 6 (Movies 4, 5 and 6) contain a representative example for each condition tested.VelocityCell velocities were calculated as microns per hour. As shown in Figure 4 and summarized in Tables 3 and 4, the velocity of cell displacement was significantly slower in 2D when compared to staged control and tumor-associated 3D ECMs (12 \u03bcm/h vs. 23 \u03bcm/h and 19 \u03bcm/h, respectively with Ps < 0.0001). In addition, the relatively high velocities observed in both control and tumor-associated 3D ECMs were not significantly different from each other (P = 0.1606). Measurements under PI3K blockage showed that while 10 nM Wortmannin effectively inhibited cell velocity in 3D control, this concentration had no effect in tumor-associated 3D ECMs (17 \u03bcm/h and 19 \u03bcm/h with P = 0.0023 and 0.5286, respectively). Higher Wortmannin concentrations (50 nM) slightly, yet not significantly, further inhibited cell velocities induced by 3D control, while this concentration caused a statistically significant inhibition of velocity induced by tumor-associated 3D ECMs (15 vs. 16 \u03bcm/h with P = 0.2859 vs. 0.0114, respectively). Interestingly, mAb13 treatments, blocking the function of beta1-integrins, were found to have greater effects in control than in tumor-associated 3D ECMs (9 \u03bcm/h vs. 14 \u03bcm/h representing 60% vs. 26% inhibition compared to untreated, respectively). When both drugs were used in combination, cells in control 3D ECMs were significantly faster compared to mAb13 alone (12 \u03bcm/h and 11 \u03bcm/h with P = 0.0348 and 0.0015, respectively). In comparison, in tumor-associated matrices no additional effects were observed (14 \u03bcm/h and 13 \u03bcm/h with P = 0.8733 and 0.1978, respectively). The results suggested that beta1-integrin regulates the velocity of MDA-MB-231 cells, and that PI3K inhibition somewhat abolished the beta1-integrin regulatory effect in control 3D ECMs, while these two pathways seemed to work in tandem in the regulation of cell velocity induced by tumor-associated 3D ECMs.matrix induced velocity (\u03bcm/h)substrate\t2D\tcontrol 3D\ttumor-associated 3D\t \ttreatment\tCtrl\tCtrl\tWt 10 nM\tWt 50 nM\tmAb13\tmAb13 +Wt 10 nM\tmAb13 +Wt 50 nM\tCtrl\tWt 10 nM\tWt 50 nM\tmAb13\tmAb13 +Wt 10 nM\tmAb13 +Wt 50 nM\t \tMean\t12\t23\t17\t15\t9\t12\t11\t19\t19\t16\t14\t14\t13\t \t\t \tSample Size\t69\t83\t56\t130\t68\t69\t148\t130\t74\t129\t115\t99\t150\t \t\t \tStd.

Bolded data represent conditions in which differences were observed between control and tumor-associated 3D matrix induced velocity due to stated treatments.Staged 3D ECMs induce relatively fast MDA-MB-231 invasion that is differentially regulated by PI3K and beta1-integrinpathways. Time-lapse assays spanning 6 h were carried out as described in Methods, to determine the velocity of MDA-MB-231 cells cultured on 2D or within staged 3D ECMS in the presence and/or absence of 10 and 50 nM Wortmannin and/or 50 \u03bcg/ml mAb13. Cell velocities, calculated in microns per hour (\u03bcm/h), were plotted as individual dots while mean velocities are marked with horizontal lines (see Tables 3 and 4 for quantitative details). Note that Wortmannin and mAb13 treatments induced different effects in velocities of cells invading through control vs. tumor-associated 3D ECMs.DirectionalitySince we have previously shown that fibroblasts invade in a directional manner within control 3D ECMs as opposed to migrating randomly on 2D substrates, and in addition, directionality has been observed in vivo in highly metastatic mammary cells invading through mesenchymal stroma, directionality of cells was measured in staged, control vs. tumor-associated, 3D ECMs. Cell directionality, was assessed by measuring the angle of direction of each cell in segments spanning 10 minutes each. The percentages of cell-directions including angles within 5\u00b0 from the mode angle, in each cell trajectory, were calculated and are shown in Figure 5 while a summary of the data is presented in Tables 5 and 6. Cells with higher percentage of similar angles represent persistent directional behaviors, while lower percentages indicate tracks that followed random directions. Results indicated that while cells moved randomly on 2D conditions (18%) they seemed to invade with a high degree of directionality through both control and tumor-associated 3D ECMs (22% and 26%). Moreover, this increase in directionality was significant between staged 3D matrices (P = 0.0109). Measurements performed under inhibitory PI3K conditions showed that while directionality was modestly to significantly decreased by 10 and 50 nM Wortmannin in control 3D matrices (19% and 18% with P = 0.0219 and < 0.0001, respectively), the inhibitor seemed to have no effect on directionality induced by tumor-associated 3D ECMs (26% and 25% with P = 0.6641 and 0.5551, respectively). On the other hand, while mAb13 seemed to have no significant effect on cellular directionality in the control (19% with P = 0.2395), it appeared to have a profound inhibitory effect in tumor-associated 3D ECMs (18% with P < 0.0001). Combinations of Wortmannin and mAb13 did not change observations obtained using mAb13 as a single treatment. Results suggested that beta1-integrin regulates tumor-associated 3D ECM-induced directional invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while PI3K somewhat regulated the directionality of these cells induced by control 3D ECMs.3D matrix induced directionality (\u00b1%)substrate\t2D\tcontrol 3D\ttumor-associated 3D\t \ttreatment\tCtrl\tCtrl\tWt 10 nM\tWt 50 nM\tmAb13\tmAb13 +Wt 10 nM\tmAb13 +Wt 50 nM\tCtrl\tWt 10 nM\tWt 50 nM\tmAb13\tmAb13 +Wt 10 nM\tmAb13 +Wt 50 nM\t \tMean\t18\t22\t19\t18\t19\t20\t19\t26\t26\t25\t18\t19\t18\t \t\t \tSample Size\t69\t83\t56\t130\t68\t69\t148\t130\t74\t129\t115\t99\t150\t \t\t \tStd.

Bolded data represent conditions in which differences were observed between control and tumor-associated 3D matrix induced directionality due to stated treatments.Tumor-associated 3D ECMs induce directional MDA-MB-231 invasion regulated by beta1-integrin but not PI3K. Time-lapse assays were carried out to determine the directionality of MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence and/or absence of 10 and 50 nM Wortmannin and/or 50 \u03bcg/ml mAb13. Dots plotted in graph indicate percentages of angles positioned within 5\u00b0 from the identified mode angle per cell (data was rounded and therefore appears organized (for additional details, see Material and Methods)). Upper and lower borders of diamond shapes show 75 and 25 percentile populations, respectively, while diamond widths marked with a horizontal line, mark median percentages at 5\u00b0 variance from the mode angle direction. Note that when compared with 2D and 3D matrices, tumor-associated 3D matrices induced greater degree of directionality, which was regulated by beta1-integrin but not by PI3K activity. See Tables 5 and 6 for statistical information.Relative track orientationWe have previously shown that similar to their in vivo counterparts, tumor-associated ECMs present parallel fiber patterns of organization. In addition, it has been suggested that cells utilize matrix-patterned fibers for their mesenchymal type of invasive behavior. Therefore, we proceeded to measure the relative track orientations of cells in all conditions. For this, the mode angle of cell-track orientation was calculated on each recorded region, and all cell tracks in this region were reoriented to fit a common arbitrary mode angle of 0\u00b0. Percentages of cell-tracks sharing common angles were plotted (Figure 6). Conditions inducing 70% or more counts at 20\u00b0 distance from the mode angle were considered as \"organized.\" The results show a high degree of orientation in cells invading through tumor-associated as opposed to control 3D matrices (79% vs. 55%, respectively). In addition, low or high levels of PI3K inhibition did not apparently affect the relative orientation of MDA-MB-231 cells invading through tumor-associated 3D ECMs (74% and 71%, respectively), while beta1-integrin inhibition effectively disorganized their relative orientation reaching only 40% of tracks at 20\u00b0 variance from the mode. Moreover, the relative disorganized pattern seemed to prevail when mAb13 was used in combination with low or high concentrations of Wortmannin (49% or 48%, respectively). As expected, none of the treatments induced relative track orientation in control 3D ECM induced MDA-MB-231 invasion. The results presented herein suggested that tumor-associated, but not control 3D ECMs, induced an oriented parallel pattern of invasion in MDA-MB-231, and that this orientation is beta1-integrin dependent and PI3K independent.Tumor-associated 3D ECMs induce relative organized MDA-MB-231 track orientations regulated by beta1-integrin but not by PI3K pathways. Time-lapse assays were carried out using MDA-MB-231 cells cultured on 2D or within staged 3D ECMs in the presence and/or absence of 10 and 50 nM Wortmannin and/or 50 \u03bcg/ml mAb13. Representative trajectory tracks were attained using Microsoft Excel as described in Methods. Orientation angles of the trajectories relative to the X-axis were rounded to the nearest 20th degree in order to identify a mode orientation angle. This mode angle was arbitrarily set as 0\u00b0 and the original angles were rotated accordingly. Next, a new rounding of the rotated but otherwise intact data was performed only this time it was approximated to the 10th degree (see Methods for additional details). The percentages of angles positioned within 20\u00b0 variance from the mode angle are indicated in the figure. Note that tumor-associated 3D matrices support oriented cell invasive trajectories (greater than 70% organization) in a beta1-integrin but not PI3K dependent manner.DiscussionIt is well established that tumor-associated stromal ECMs influence tumorigenesis. It has been shown that increase in collagen density, as seen in our late 3D matrices, supports tumor formation, invasion and metastases. Moreover, it has been proposed that Activated Stromal Indexes, calculated as ratios between the degree of fibrous mesenchymal collagen and levels of a desmoplastic marker (alpha-smooth muscle actin), can be useful tools for assessing probable neoplastic prognostics. In this study, we observed that assorted cells present different behaviors within reciprocal ECMs. Therefore, the results of this study suggest a need for cellular predisposition to invasion even though classic 2D culturing methods were found to be insufficient for predicting tumorigenicity of cells. This is particularly apparent when comparing 3D to 2D conditions. For example, in 2D conditions, the invasive potential of MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells could not be determined as they exhibited similar behaviors. Nevertheless, it was not surprising to discover that the stage of the 3D matrices further contributed to the induction of in vivo-like cell invasion.It has previously been shown that matrix extracts obtained from murine mammary glands at various developmental stages, differently influence MDA-MB-231 invasion, and that both age and reproductive state of stroma, can differentially affect breast tumor development. In addition, it has been established that diverse pathways affect distinct cell invasion strategies, such as \"mesenchymal invasion,\" characterized by spindled cells that invade following the direction of ECM fibers, vs. \"amoeboid invasion,\" where rounded cells move between fibers in a less directional or more random manner. Interestingly, tampering with mesenchymal invasion causes changes to invasive strategy (mesenchymal to amoeboid), yet fails to block invasion in vivo . Knowing that MDA-MB-231 cells have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, we questioned whether early or late stromal stages (e.g., control and tumor-associated 3D ECMs), could differentially regulate MDA-MB-231's behavior. What is more, it has been suggested that beta1-integrin dependent, yet PI3K independent pathways, could regulate ECM-induced Akt/PKB activity. Therefore, we tested if interfering with pathways known to regulate cell invasion in general (e.g., Akt/PKB) or mesenchymal type of invasion in particular (beta1-integrin), would differentially affect the cells invading through early vs. late stromal ECMs. Figure 7 summarizes our results depicting all the cell trajectory tracks obtained for each condition tested (for representative videos see Additional files 4, 5 and 6; Movies 4\u20136). The relative spread of the star-like graphs in this figure, depicts the cell velocities where bigger stars represent fast cell movements. By looking at the patterns of the tracks, it is evident that conditions sustaining directional movements presented relatively straight line-tracks while wiggle lines represented directions that are more random. In regards to relative track orientations, the agglomeration of tracks near the X-axis shows the degree of tracks that were found to orient towards the most common angle on each experimental condition. Therefore, as a synopsis, we observed that indeed both early (control) and late (tumor-associated) 3D ECMs support a mesenchymal type of invasive behavior in MDA-MB-231 cells by inducing beta1-integrin regulated spindled morphology (Figure 3) and a relatively fast (Figure 4) and directional migration (Figure 5). Inhibition of beta-1 integrin effectively blocked the mesenchymal type of invasion supported by early matrix. Nevertheless, in late matrices, beta-1 integrin inhibition prompted little effect in velocity, while cellular morphology, directionality, and relative track organization of the trajectories were greatly influenced. This data suggests that, in the late-stage matrix, beta-1 integrin inhibition induces a change of invasive strategy. As a result, we believe that it is possible that tumor-associated (late), but not control (early), 3D ECMs support alternative, other than mesenchymal type of MDA-MB-231, invasion. Whether this altered invasive behavior is \"amoeboid-like,\" is out of the scope of this work yet, the fact that the invasive behavior is random (as opposed to directional) and the cells present active blebs only in late 3D matrices under beta1-integrin inhibition (compare Additional file 4 and 5 (Movies 4 and 5)), strongly support this idea. We observed that beta1-integrin and/or PI3K pathways differentially regulate early vs. late stromal matrix induced (in vivo-like) invasive behavior. Furthermore, this work supports the notion that cells can behave differently within early vs. late stromal ECMs, and that both \"cells\" and \"matrices\" need predisposition to attain favorable invasion. For example, inhibition of PI3K or, to a better extent, blocking beta1-integrin function could potentially reduce invasive cell velocities in early (control) 3D matrices, yet combinations of these drugs would be counteractive. On the other hand, in late stage stromal matrices (tumor-associated), this combinatorial approach inhibits velocities to the same extent as beta1-integrin blockage alone. Perhaps, beta1-integrin inhibition in combination with that of additional pathways will prove to be more effective in the future for inhibition of possible alternative invasive strategies.PI3K and beta1-integrin pathways play different roles in regulating 3D matrix-induced breast cancer cell invasion. Representative MDA-MB-231 trajectory tracks were attained as described in Methods. Orientation angles of the trajectories relative to the X-axis were rounded to the nearest 20th degree in order to identify a mode orientation angle. This mode was arbitrarily set as 0\u00b0 and the original angles were rotated accordingly (see Methods for additional details). The resulting tracks were plotted as if all shared a common origin to generate a star like pattern. Graph scales are shown in micrometers to appreciate distances travelled during the recorded 6 h periods. Note that cells invading through tumor-associated 3D ECMs appear to move relatively fast (length of tacks), directional (straightness of tracks) and with a relative greater level of common or parallel orientation (orientation of tracks near the X-axis) when compared to control 3D ECMs. In addition, inhibition of beta1-integrin function (mAb13) effectively blocked cell invasion through control 3D ECMs, as shown by the resulting relatively small star. In contrast, blockage of beta1-integrin activity in these invasive cells triggered a change in the invasive strategy induced by tumor-associated 3D ECMs. This observation is apparent by contemplating the relatively large stars with wiggle tracks, as opposed to straight tracks, that lack organization near the X-axis in all experimental data attained in the presence of mAb13.ConclusionOur data suggests that while both early and later matrices sustain mesenchymal invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, only late stromal 3D matrices support a change of invasive strategy triggered by beta1-integrin inhibition. Therefore, our observations imply that \"staging\" stromal matrices, analogously to clinically relevant \"tumor staging,\" might be an important step in assertively selecting invasive drug inhibitors. In addition, this work presents novel matrix-based assays to score tumor cell invasiveness and stroma permissiveness. These assays can be performed in a relatively short period of time, so that the stage of matrices produced in vitro accurately mimic the in vivo tumor microenvironment of the patient. It is possible that future applications of these assays could be used to score the effectiveness of targeted cancer drugs in inhibiting different aspects of cancer cell metastasis. Hence, this study could one day facilitate the identification of individuals at increased risk of recurrence, which remains a considerable challenge in the field, as well as personalized effective treatments.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsRCC, as first author, made substantial contributions to the conception and design of the manuscript, and either acquired or supervised the acquisition of all data in addition to assisting in the analysis and the interpretation of the data.

Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells.

Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation. A Concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1-cultured medium (CM) after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

E ELISA assay of the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively. (n\u2009=\u20093) *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAs cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent CAFs-inducer, TGF-\u03b2 secretion in 4T1 conditioned medium (CM) was measured by ELISA assay after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Scale bar: 2\u00a0mm. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Unpaired t-test was used for analysis of differences between two groups. Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above.

Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was recorded (Ex/Em\u2009=\u2009360\u00a0nm/430\u00a0nm), respectively after leaving the mixture at room temperature for 12\u00a0h. The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor.

The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score.

Specifically, high rates of metastasis to the lymph nodes, lungs, bone and brain, not the primary tumor, are the leading cause of breast cancer death. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis may lead to more effective strategies for the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer.Growing evidence indicates that malignant breast tissue requires complex local and systemic stromal interactions to provide a tumor-promoting environment during breast carcinoma development and progression. Specifically, tumor stromal cells cross-communicate and develop an aggressive phenotype of cancer cells, which are recognized as an important modulator and even a driver of tumorigenicity. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component of the tumor microenvironment, have been proven to be a major contributor of various processes, such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and drug resistance. These effects are mediated by paracrine stimulation from a variety of growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukins (IL). Our previous study indicated that CAFs stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impaired taxol efficacy in breast cancer by elevating NF-\u03baB/miR-21 signaling. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which CAFs feed the cancer cells and allow them to acquire an aggressive phenotype and the molecular mediators involved in these processes have not been extensively studied.In addition to the several well-documented gene mutations that have been associated with the development of breast cancer, considerable attention is being focused on the participation of epigenetic events, including the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. Highly up-regulated in breast cancer, the lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) mediates H3K27 tri-methylation and the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is considered a key molecule and potential biomarker for breast cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR is reportedly involved in drug resistance and stemness maintenance in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, growing evidence indicates that HOTAIR promotes metastasis breast, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma. Given its critical role during tumor progression, HOTAIR is a novel target for breast cancer therapy.The activation of CDK5 signaling has been implicated in the control of cell motility and metastatic potential, which are significantly correlated with several markers of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that the aberrant activation of CDK5 signaling is associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which was responsible for high-dose taxol-induced invasion and EMT. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of CDK5 remains elusive. Moreover, CDK5 was proven to be essential for TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in breast cancer progression. Strikingly, aberrant CDK5 promoter DNA hypomethylation was identified in the mantle cell lymphoma genome compared with normal naive B cells. These findings indicate an interaction between CDK5 signaling and tumor stromal cells, which may underlie the novel epigenetic mechanism of tumor environment-induced metastasis and hold therapeutic potential in breast cancer.Based on these previous studies, we further demonstrated that CAFs promoted the metastasis of breast cancer cells via paracrine TGF-\u03b21, which is a crucial mediator of the interaction between stromal and cancer cells. Importantly, CAFs transactivated HOTAIR to promote EMT. Strikingly, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4. Additionally, CAFs mediated HOTAIR expression and EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling, and H3K27 trimethylation was highly enriched at the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. Overall, we describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the CAF-induced aggressive behavior of cancer cells, which support the targeting of the TGF-\u03b21/ HOTAIR axis as a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.MethodsCell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The CAFs were isolated and cultured as described previously. CAFs were acquired from four invasive breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), and the use of specimens was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH. CAFs were obtained from tissues that had been cut into small pieces and digested with collagenase type I (1\u2009mg/mL; Sigma) and hyaluronidase (125\u00a0units/mL; Sigma) for 6\u2009h in DMEM without FBS at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After filtering the undigested tissues, the stromal fraction was centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) or RMPI Medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Cytokine antibody arrayThe profiles of cytokines secreted by CAFs were detected in the culture supernatants using a Human Cytokine Array (RayBiotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cytokines with distinct differences in expression were screened out.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The culture medium was removed and used to assess the level of extracellular TGF-\u03b21 with a TGF-\u03b21 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, abcam) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results are expressed in ng/mL.Western blottingThe total protein was extracted with cold radio-immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The cell lysates were separated using 8-10% SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Antibodies against human CDK5, CDK5RAP1, H3K27me3, EZH2 (1:1000 dilutions, Cell Signaling Technology), Egr-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin (1:1000 dilutions, Abcam), and \u03b2-actin (1:4000 dilutions, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. Rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. The antibody-labeled protein bands on membranes were detected with a G-BOX iChemi XT instrument (Syngene).ImmunofluorescenceAfter various treatments, cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100 for 10\u2009min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1\u2009h. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted with antibodies against \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and vimentin (1:100 dilutions, Abcam). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Technologies) secondary antibodies. To detect the formation of stress fibers, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscopes. Cells from three independent experiments in which at least 300 cells were counted were quantified.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the standard protocol. HOTAIR cDNA was obtained from total RNA using the Fast Quant RT Kit (TIANGEN). Real-time PCR was performed using Super Real Pre Mix Plus SYBR Green (TIANGEN) on an ABI-7500 Real-time PCR machine (Life Technologies).The following thermocycling protocol was employed: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 40\u00a0cycles. GAPDH was used as the internal control. Data are presented as fold changes (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct) and were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software V 2.02 (MJ Research).Wound-healing assayApproximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 cells or 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MCF-7 cells were plated in six-well plates after different treatments. A linear scratch/wound was made on the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs of live cells were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification, and the distance migrated was observed after 48\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h.Matrigel invasion assayThe Matrigel invasion assay was performed in 24-well Transwell culture plates. Briefly, 40\u2009\u03bcL of Matrigel (1\u2009mg/mL, BD) was applied to 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane filters. Approximately 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MDA-MB-231 cells or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MCF-7 cells were resuspended and then seeded in 24-well Transwell plates containing FBS-free medium in the upper chamber and complete growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the lower chamber for 24\u00a0h or 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Non-invading cells were removed from the upper surfaces of the invasion membranes, and the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin. The average number of cells per field was determined by counting the cells in six random fields per well. Cells were counted in four separate fields in three independent experiments.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)The expression of HOTAIR in paraffin-embedded sections and cells of different conditions seeded on the sterile coverslips for 48\u00a0h was examined in situ hybridization. First, we deparaffinized and rehydrated the samples. Before digesting samples with proteinase K, we used 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the paraffin-embedded sections and DEPC water to fix the cell samples. We then hybridized samples with a 5\u2019Cy3-labeled modified HOTAIR probe (6\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After completing the hybridization, the samples were successively washed twice with solution buffer (2\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7, chloride sodium citrate buffer) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min each. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using an FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)The EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) was used to perform the ChIP assays. Briefly, 1% formaldehyde was used to fix cells, and 0.125\u00a0M glycine was then used to neutralize the formaldehyde. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer with SDS and protease inhibitors. Soluble chromatins of 200-1000\u00a0bp were collected after sonication and pre-cleared in 1:10 dilution buffer, followed by incubation with IgG, H3K27me3 and EZH2 anti-bodies on a rotating platform overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing the immunocomplexes captured by protein G-Sepharose beads, the bound DNA fragments were eluted for real-time qPCR analysis using ChIP primer.Luciferase reporter assayThe upstream 2.5\u2009kb promoter regions of HOTAIR were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (GV238 vector), and the mutations of predicted SMADs binding sites were also cloned into the same luciferase reporter vector. Cells were co-transfected with SMAD plasmid GV219 vector and HOTAIR plasmid (wild type or mutant) for 24\u00a0h, and the promoter activities were examined with a luciferase assay.Orthotopic nude mouse models and treatmentBALB/c nude mice aged 4-6\u00a0weeks were purchased from the Animal Center at the Cancer Institute at Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Lenti-HOTAIR or Lenti NC and CAFs were injected into the mammary fat pads of each nude mouse at a ratio of 1:3. The mice were imaged for luciferase activity with an IVIS imaging system once per week.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry analysisThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to an immunohistochemistry analysis. After blocking with 3% H2O2 and non-immune rabbit serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by a streptavidin-biotinylated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The chromogenic substrate was developed with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine, andhematoxylin was used for counter staining. The results were visualized using a light microscope.Statistical analysesSPSS 16.0 (IBM, USA) was used for all calculations. All values are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made using Student\u2019s t-test, and differences among groups were assessed with a two-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significance was set to P\u2009<\u20090.05.*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01.ResultsParacrine TGF-\u03b21 was essential for CAFs to promote the metastasis of breast cancer cellsTGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated cells. a Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of CAFs. b The top ten cytokine secreted by CAFs. Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of MCF-7 (c), MDA-MB-231(e) and by treatment of CAF-CM. Relative signal intensity of top ten increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (d), MDA-MB-231(f), compared to the control cellsDuring breast cancer progression, CAFs may supply appropriate signals that may promote the development of aggressive phenotypes in carcinoma cells and establish a complex scenario, which culminates in metastasis. To identify the cytokines secreted by CAFs that enhance tumorigenic ability, the cytokine profiles of cell supernatants from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and treatment with conditioned media of CAFs (CAF-CM) were analyzed using a RayBiotech Human Cytokine Antibody Array. The top four cytokines secreted in the supernatant of CAFs were TGF-\u03b21, IGFBP-4, IGF-1 and PDGF-AA (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in both CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (Fig. 1c, d) as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to control cells (Fig.1e, f).To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, the distribution of TGF-\u00df1 in clinic samples was performed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). It\u2019s well documented that CAFs strongly expressed \u03b1-SMA, whereas were negative for the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin-7 and TGF-\u00df1 showed that the red fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 colocalized with green fluorescence of \u03b1-SMA, but not with cytokeratin-7 in both invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. More important, much more and stronger fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 was detected in invasive breast carcinoma, compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively, these results indicated that TGF-\u00df1may be secreted by CAFs.Paracrine TGF-\u03b21 was enssential for CAFs induced EMT. a The amount of TGF-\u03b21 released into the cell culture supernatant of cells treated with CAF-CM was determined by ELISA. b The wound-healing assay of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor SB431542 (SB) or pirfenidone (PFD), respectively. c SB or PFD treatment impaired the CAF-mediated increase in invading cancer cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. d Western blotting analysis for E-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b2-catenin of cells treated as in (b). e Immunofluorescence staining showed that treatment with SB or PFD increased E-cadherin levels, decreased vimentin and nuclear \u03b2-catenin distribution in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. CAFs promoted F-actin polymerization and stability in cancer cells, whereas treatment with SB or PFD impaired the formation of stress fibers. Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcmDue to the changes of quantity and quality in CAFs from different patients, we extracted CAFs from four invasive breast carcinomas patients to reduce the original difference in this study (Additional file 1: Figure S2). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with conditioned media of CAF1#, CAF2#, CAF3# and CAF4#, respectively. ELISA further confirmed all of the four CAFs populations induced significant increased TGF-\u03b21 level in the supernatants from CAF-CM-treated cells (mean value: 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 6.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.243\u00a0ng/ml in MCF-7 cells; 0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 4.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0ng/ml in MDA-MB-231 cells) (Fig.\u00a02a, Additional file 1: Figure S3). We then further evaluated the role of TGF-\u03b21 in CAFs induced EMT of cancer cells. We found that TGF-\u03b21 treatment achieved similar enhanced the migratory activity of cancer cell, compared with CAF-CM treated cells (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the small-molecule inhibitors of TGF-\u03b21, SB451332 (SB) or Pirfenidone (PFD) treatment abrogated the CAF-CM induced promotion of cell migration. Moreover, all of the four CAFs populations were competent in enhancing the cell invasive ability, while the number of invading cells was deceased 2- to 3.5-fold in SB or PFD treated cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Figure S4). Moreover, SB and PDF treatment markedly rescued the induction of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin expression as well as the repression of E-cadherin in CAF-CM-treated cells (Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescent images showed that SB or PFD treatment decreased the nuclear signals of \u00df-catenin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the nuclear translocation to the cytoplasm was promoted (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the remodeling and polarization of F-actin was observed after CAF stimulation, whereas the formation of a stress fiber pattern was abolished after SB or PFD treatment. These results identified TGF-\u03b21 as a crucial mediator of the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer cells and TGF-\u03b21 was necessary for CAFs to induce EMT of cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT by activating the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cellsCAFs enhanced the expression of the lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cells to induce EMT. a The expression of seveal metastasis associated LncRNAs treated with CAF-CM was measured by RC-PCR. HOTAIR levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells upon treatment with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, SB or PFD was measured by real-time RT-PCR (b) or FISH (c). Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. d Western blotting indicated that the EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression levels were significantly increased in CAF-CM-treated cells. e The expression levels of the indicated epithelial or mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were measured by western blotting. f The depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invaded cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. Quantitation of invasive MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. For each measurement, \u2265\u200910 fields of view with \u2265\u2009100 cells were analyzed; *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01The epigenetic regulation of lncRNA triggered invasion and metastasis in breast cancer. To study the epigenetic mechanism by which CAFs induce EMT in cancer cells, the expression of several lncRNAs were measured by RT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a). Specifically, CAF-CM resulted in the largest increases in HOTAIR expression, 3.5- and 8.7-fold increases inMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to the control cells. Similar to CAF-CM, recombinant TGF-\u03b21 also increased the levels of HOTAIR (Fig. 3b). However, the CAF-CM mediated activation of HOTAIR was attenuated after SB or PFD treatment. FISH images revealed that SB or PFD repressed the nuclear distribution of HOTAIR induced by CAF-CM (Fig. 3c), and Western blotting analysis indicated that the protein levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 were notably increased (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the induction of E-cadherin and repression of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin was observed in HOTAIR knock-down cells (Fig. 3e), and the depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invading cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 3f, Additional file 1: Figure S5). Based on these data, we concluded that CAFs promoted metastasis by activating HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which CAFs activate HOTAIR remain to be addressed.HOTAIR is a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4CAFs activated the transcription of HOTAIR by SMAD2/3/4. a Western blotting analysis of the effect of recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, SB or PFD treatment on the p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. b The HOTAIR expression upon treatment of siRNA against SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 was determined by real time PCR. c SMAD2/3/4 were enriched in the promoter of HOTAIR in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, as determined by a CHIP assay. d A bioinformatics assay showed the predicted binding sites of SMAD2/3/4 within the HOTAIR promoter region. e A mutational analysis of HOTAIR promoter activity. The wild-type and mutant promoter constructs were co-transfected with SMAD2, 3, or 4 plasmids into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assayTGF-\u03b2 is known to assemble a receptor complex that activates Smads thereby assembling multi-subunit complexes that regulate transcription. Western blotting analysis indicated that the levels of phosphorylated of Smad2 protein (p-SMAD2), p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4were significantly elevated in CAF-CM and TGF-\u03b21-treated cancer cells, suggesting that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a04a). However, the repression of p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 was detected in cells treated with SB or PFD. Moreover, RT-PCR showed a 50-60% reduction in HOTAIR expression in cells transfected with SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 siRNA (Fig. 4b). To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying CAF-induced HOTAIR activation, we used ChIP technology to identify the genomic locations bound by SMADs in cancer cells before and after co-culture with CAF-CM. The ChIP results indicated that CAFs stimulate the direct binding of SMAD2, 3, and 4 to the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4c), and a promoter analysis using JASPAR and PROMO indicated several candidate SMAD binding sites in the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4d). The relative profile score threshold set as 80% in JASPAR and the maximum matrix dissimilarity rate set as 15% in PROMO. Accordingly, the deletion of predicted binding sites (Mut-1 and Mut-2) within the HOTAIR promoter region decreased SMAD2/3/4 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the deletion of the remaining mutant binding sites did not result in significant differences compared with control group (Fig. 4e). Therefore, we concluded that SMADs directly bind the promoter site of HOTAIR located between nucleotides -386 and -398, -440 and -452 (the genome coordinates: chr12: 53975342-53975354, chr12: 53975396-53975408), and consequently induced the transactivation of HOTAIR.Based on these results, we elucidated that CAFs transactivated HOTAIR via the secretion TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4.CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signalingCAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling. a Western blotting indicated that CDK5 expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 expression levels were greatly decreased. b The histone methylation status of CDK5 signaling was determined with a CHIP assay, which indicated that H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, whereas the depletion of HOTAIR blocked this function of CAFs. The results are presented as the fold-change over the control. c ChIP analysis revealed that elevated EZH2 was recruited to the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. All experiments were repeated three times. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. negative controlWe previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. Consistent with our previous study, CDK5 protein expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the levels of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 were greatly decreased (Fig.\u00a05a). These findings suggest that the activation of CDK5 was essential for CAF-induced EMT. To investigate the epigenetic events that were involved in the activation of CDK5 in breast cancer, we first examined the histone methylation status using ChIP assays (Fig. 5b). Profiling histone methylation marks on the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter by qChIP showed that H3K27me3 is highly enriched at the promoter of both genes in CAF-CM treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells compared with the control cells. Whereas the depletion of HOTAIR rescued the effect of CAFs, the H3K27me3 levels at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter were remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the recruitment of EZH2 to the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was measured, which indicated that the level of PRC2 components at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was significantly decreased (Fig. 5c). Based on these data, we demonstrated that the activation of CDK5 was required for CAF-mediated EMT. Specifically, CAFs stimulated CDK5 expression by H3K27 trimethylation on the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling.Knock-down HOTAIR inhibited CAF-induced tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivoThe depletion of HOTAIR suppressed CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. a Representative pseudocolor bioluminescence images of tumor size were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors of MDA-MB-231-Luc cells were transfected with control shRNA or shHOTAIR. Each group included eight mice (n\u2009=\u20098). Primary tumor volumes (b) and representative bioluminescence images (BLI) (c) were evaluated. d Lung metastasis was detected by bioluminescent imaging on days 35 and 42. e Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained lung tissues. f The expression of HOTAIR was assessed by FISH. g Representative images of the immunohistochemical staining of CDK5, EZH2, \u00df-catenin, H3K27me3, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 in tissues. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcmTo study the epigenetic mechanism of CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, an MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established in nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging was monitored weekly and indicated that all of the four CAF populations remarkably promoted primary tumor growth, whereas shHOTAIR treatment markedly reduced tumor volume (Fig.\u00a06a-c, Additional file 1: Figure S6). Most importantly, CAFs resulted in dramatic lung metastasis with extensive tumor foci compared to control cells, as determined by quantitative bioluminescence images (Fig. 6d). However, this metastatic phenomenon was attenuated when HOTAIR was knocked down, and H&E staining further confirmed these results (Fig. 6e). Compared to the control group, CAFs enhanced the nuclear staining of HOTAIR, as revealed by FISH, which further confirmed our in vitro study (Fig. 6f). Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed the downregulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and reductions in p-SMAD2-, p-SMAD3-, EZH2- and H3K27me3- positive cells in the shHOTAIR group (Fig. 6g). Taken together, these findings indicate that shHOTAIR treatment efficiently blocked the crosstalk between CAFs and tumor cells, thereby impairing CAF-induced EMT. Collectively, these experiments supported the notion that the secretion TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD pathway in breast cancer cells, resulting in the up-regulation of HOTAIR transcription and histone modification of the CDK5 signaling pathway, thereby promoting breast cancer progression and metastasis.Aberrant HOTAIR correlated with a poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancerOverexpressed HOTAIR correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. a HOTAIR expression was analyzed by FISH. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. b Immunohistochemistry staining detected EZH2, CDK5, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 expression in 59 breast carcinoma samples (39 with lymph node metastasis, 19 in situ carcinoma)To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, we collected 59 breast carcinoma samples and examined markers of CAFs FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA by immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression levels of FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA were significantly up-regulated in invasive breast carcinoma (97.5%, 38 in 39), compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 33.3%, 7 of 20), suggesting that CAFs facilitated tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Compared to DCIS, HOTAIR expression and nuclear staining were higher in metastatic breast carcinoma, as revealed by FISH images, which indicated that the upregulation of HOTAIR strongly correlated with tumor metastasis (Fig.\u00a07a). Furthermore, the expression levels of EZH2 and CDK5 exhibited similar patterns, which further confirmed our in vitro and in vivo studies (Fig. 7b).DiscussionThe proposed model of the paracrine and epigenetic mechanism of CAFs induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. CAFs secreted high levels of TGF-\u03b21, resulting in the transactivation of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells, consequently enhanced metastasisBased on our results, we propose a model of the CAF-mediated upregulation of HOTAIR transcription in breast cancer cells that promotes invasion and metastasis via the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 (Fig.\u00a08). The hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b21 signaling clearly contributes to tumor metastasis and the metabolic reprogramming and activation of CAFs. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 has been linked to poor clinical outcome and is required for the CAF-mediated initiation of efficient metastasis. Consistent with these results, our data further indicate that the key pro-metastatic function of CAFs depends on TGF-\u03b21 secretion (Fig. 2). Specifically, blocking TGF-\u03b21 secretion with SB or PFDefficiently abrogated CAF-mediated metastasis. Our study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 is a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment.Non-coding RNAs have been added to the growing list of gene regulators that contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, mounting evidence has revealed that the up-regulation of HOTAIR contributed to drug resistance and tumor metastasis in various types of solid tumors. In this study, our experiment demonstrated that CAFs upregualted HOTAIR expression via TGF-\u03b21 secretion, supporting its importance in breast cancer progression (Fig. 3b-f). Most importantly, SMAD2/3/4 directly bound the promoter site of HOTAIR, as revealed by CHIP and luciferase reporter assay, suggesting that HOTAIR was a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4 (Fig. 4c and e). These findings suggested that the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs clearly led to the transactivation of HOTAIR expression. And the breast cancer microenvironment plays a key role in maintaining HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. Our studies provide a strong body of evidence to support that the modulation of epigenetic control and targeted alterations of HOTAIR represent novel therapeutic targets in breast cancer.Extensive reports have identified several microRNA induced by CAFs (e.g., miR-26b, miR-148a and miR-133b) that were invovled in tumor progression. Specifically, our previous study verified that CAFs impaired taxol efficacy by activating miR-21 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe that the CAF-mediated expression of long non-coding RNA led to enhanced cell migration and invasion.We previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of CDK5 activation has not been fully elucidated. In cancer, gene expression profiles revealed a loss of tumor suppressor gene expression due to aberrant histone modification. Specifically, Kumar et al. reported that H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter of CDK5 was a key mechanism underlying cocaine-induced plasticity in the striatum. In the present study, we proved that CAFs mediated the transcription of HOTAIR, leading to a strong increase in the H3K27-mediated trimethylation of the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoters, thereby activating CDK5 expression and EMT.Although our study focuses on the TGF-\u03b21, CAFs may also secrete a cocktail of additional pro-metastatic factors, such as IL-6 and IGF-II, to contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, additional crucial lncRNAs involved in the development of breast cancer remain to be investigated.ConclusionsCAFs may orchestrate multiple non-coding RNA and signaling pathways to control several biological processes in a paracrine manner during breast cancer progression. We reported here that secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs was a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal cells and cancer cells to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. Our study revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis, the TGF-\u00df1/HOTAIR axis controls the development and progression of breast cancer, which supports the pursuit of these molecules as targets of breast cancer treatment.Additional fileAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerCAFsCarcinoma associated fibroblastsDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumEMTEpithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionFBSFetal bovine serumHOTAIRHOX transcript antisense RNAPBSPhosphate-buffered salinePCRPolymerase chain reactionPFDPirfenidoneSBSB431542Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12943-018-0758-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Authors\u2019 contributionsMM,CSK and YR conceived and designed this study.

Our results suggest novel targets of CuB in breast cancer in vitro and in vivo.INTRODUCTIONBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Studies suggest that around 232,340 new cases will be diagnosed and around 39,620 women will die due to breast cancer by the end of 2013. The HER2/neu is a proto-oncogene, which is amplified in several neoplasms like breast, salivary gland, stomach, kidney and lung. It is overexpressed in about 30% of breast cancer patients, which leads to poor clinical outcomes. HER2 is a mitogenic tyrosine kinase receptor, known to induce transforming signals and hence directly promotes cell proliferation. The HER2 expression can lead to impaired DNA repair, angiogenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, HER2 has been shown to interact with several other growth promoting mechanisms like TGF\u03b2, estrogen receptor, FOXO1A, Src kinases, ILK and integrins to reinforce oncogenesis and metastasis. Trastuzumab (herceptin) is a specific antibody for HER2 that is used against HER2+ breast cancer. But studies indicate limitations of trastuzumab therapy due to cardio-toxicity and resistance in patients.Integrins is a large family of cell adhesion receptors, which also perform other diverse functions like cell survival and motility. Various integrins have been implicated in tumor cell survival, proliferation and metastasis. Importantly, two major integrin heterodimers ITGAVB3 (\u03b1V\u03b23) and ITGA6B4 (\u03b16\u03b24) have been found to play specific role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. There is a strong evidence that cross-talk between HER2 and ITGA6B4 promotes tumor aggressiveness. ITGB4 (Integrin \u03b24) contributes to HER2 up-regulation in mammary tumors suggesting a strong correlation between HER2 and integrins in mammary tumor development and progression. Identification of novel agents that can target both HER2 and integrin signaling could be beneficial for the treatment of breast cancer overexpressing HER2.Cucurbitacins are triterpenoid steroidal compounds mainly present in the Cucurbitaceae family of plants. Several evidences suggest the cytotoxic properties of Cucurbitacin B (CuB) through cell cycle arrest and STAT3 inhibition in pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the exact mechanism of CuB is not clear.The objective of the current study was to evaluate whether CuB could suppress breast cancer growth by inhibiting HER2/integrin signaling. Our results showed that CuB inhibits HER2 expression in breast cancer cells through ILK1 and YB-1 in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, it was observed that CuB inhibits ITGA6B4 (integrin \u03b16\u03b24) signaling and the subsequent cross-talk with HER2. Our study provides a novel insight into the mechanism of action of CuB along with evidence for the role of HER2-integrin signaling in breast cancer.RESULTSCuB inhibits breast cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosisConsidering breast tumor heterogeneity, we used four different cell lines with diverse phenotype and genotype. Treatment of MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and 4T-1 breast cancer cells with increasing concentrations of CuB significantly reduced the survival of these cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner with an IC50 ranging between 18 \u2013 50nM after 48 and 72h treatment (Fig. 1A - D). Previous studies reported significantly high IC50 of CuB in normal mammary epithelial cell lines as compared to SKBR3 breast cancer cells. To confirm the non-toxic effects of CuB, we evaluated its toxicity in a normal human melanocyte epithelial (PIG1) cells. Our results showed that the viability of PIG1 cells treated with CuB was least affected as compared to the viability of cancer cells (Suppl. Fig 1A). For example, treatment of with 50nM CuB for 72h inhibited the growth of PIG1 cells by 20-30% only. However, the growth of cancer cell lines like SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and 4-T1 were inhibited by 50-70% after treatment with CuB under similar conditions (Suppl. Fig 1B). These results along with previous observations suggest that CuB is relatively non-toxic to the normal cells at the concentrations required for inhibiting the growth of cancer cells.CuB induces cell death in breast cancer cells(A) MDA-MB-231, (B) SKBR3 (C) MCF-7 & (D) 4T-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of CuB for 48h or 72. Cell survival was measured with sulforhodamine B assay to estimate the IC50 values. The experiments were repeated at least three times with 8 replicates in each experiment. Apoptosis induction was measured in cells treated with various concentrations of CuB using Annexin V-FITC assay and Accuri C6 flowcytometer. (E) Representative figure of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CuB (i) 48h and (ii) 72h. (F) Concentration dependent apoptosis induction in various cell lines after 48 and 72h of CuB treatment (i) MDA-MB-231 (ii) SKBR3 (iii) MCF-7 and (iv) 4T-1 cells. Each experiment was repeated more than three times independently. *Statistically significant when compared to control (p<0.05)To explore the mechanism of the growth inhibitory effects of CuB, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 0, 15, 25, 50 and 75nM CuB for 48 or 72h. 4T-1 cells required higher concentration of CuB for induction of apoptosis and the molecular changes hence were treated with 0, 20, 40, 80 and 150nM CuB for 48h. The cells were analyzed for apoptosis using Annexin V assay. As shown in Fig. 1E & F, 75nM CuB treatment for 72h induced apoptosis in about 80% of SKBR3 cells and about 60% in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells. To further investigate the mechanism of apoptosis in CuB treated breast cancer cells, western blot analysis was performed. The western blot data of whole cell lysates from CuB treated MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells showed significant down-regulation of Bcl2 and survivin (Fig. 2A-D). Although, SKBR3 cells expressed low constitutive levels of Bcl2 and survivin, the extent of apoptosis induced by CuB was comparable with other cell lines indicating the role of multiple pathways in CuB mediated cell death. On the other hand, expression of pro-apoptotic BIM was up-regulated along with cleavage of Caspase 8 (Fig. 2A-D). We were unable to detect the cleaved fragments of Caspase 3 and hence looked at full length Caspase 3 (pro-caspase 3). The expression of full-length Caspase 3 decreased in response to CuB treatment in all the cell lines tested indicating apoptosis (Fig. 2A-D). These observations indicate the concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis by CuB in breast cancer cells.Induction of caspase mediated apoptosis by CuB: (A) MDA-MB-231 and (B) SKBR3 (C) MCF-7 and (D) 4T-1 cells were treated with varying concentrations of CuB for 48 or 72hRepresentative blots showing the concentration dependent effect of CuB on Bcl2, BIM, Survivin, Caspase 8 (cleaved) and Caspase 3 (full length). (E) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with Q-VD-OPH, a specific inhibitor for caspase 3, 1h prior to CuB treatment. The cells were collected after 48h treatment and cell lysates were analyzed for BAX cleavage using western blot technique. Histone H3 was used as a loading control. Each experiment was repeated at least three times independently.Interestingly, we observed cleavage of BAX by CuB treatment. Expression of BAX generally increases in response to apoptotic stimuli leading to caspase activation. BAX cleavage mediated by caspases or calpains is known to play a much stronger role in apoptosis. We observed that CuB treatment caused a concentration dependent cleavage of BAX at both 48h and 72h time points in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3, while no cleavage was observed in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A-C). To prove it further, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with caspase 3 inhibitor along with CuB treatment. The results from this experiment showed that caspase 3 inhibitor significantly blocked CuB mediated cleavage of BAX (Fig. 2E). Since MCF-7 is a caspase 3 null cell line, no cleavage of BAX was observed. These results indicate a direct role of caspase 3 in BAX cleavage in our model.CuB treatment suppresses HER2 signalingTo determine the mechanism of cell death induced by CuB treatment, cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting. Our results showed that treatment of MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells with CuB after 48 or 72h of treatment significantly reduced HER2 and EGFR expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A-D). Although both HER2 and EGFR were reduced after 72h of CuB treatment, effect of CuB was more pronounced at 48h in SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells. CuB inhibited HER2 in all the cell lines irrespective of ER or p53 status. Phosphorylated EGFR was undetectable in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells. However, CuB treatment significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of EGFR at Y-992 after 72h treatment in SKBR3 cells (Fig. 3B). CuB treatment also substantially reduced the expression and phosphorylation of Src at Y-416 along with decreased phosphorylation of p130CAS at Y-410. The inhibitory effects of CuB on the phosphorylation and expression of Src varied with duration of treatment in MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A-D). However, longer treatment did not cause any further suppression of phosphorylated p130CAS in any cell line. p130CAS is a downstream effector molecule of Src. Src plays a vital role in the cross-talk of HER2 with integrins in breast tumors. Furthermore, we observed suppression of TNF\u03b1-converting enzyme protease (TACE) by CuB treatment (Fig. 3A-D). The 72h treatment with CuB caused more TACE inhibition as compared to 48h treatment in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A & C). TACE has been implicated in the activation of EGFR and HER2 by TGF\u03b2. Since CuB down-regulated HER2 expression, it was important to test the effect of CuB on the regulatory molecules of HER2. As shown in Fig. 3A-D, treatment of cells with CuB substantially reduced the expression of ILK1 and Twist. It was observed that in MCF-7 cells, CuB treatment reduced ILK1 expression more at 72h treatment as compared to 48h. TWIST suppression was more pronounced at 48h treatment with CuB in all the three cell lines. Furthermore, suppression of YB-1 expression as well its phosphorylation at S-102 was also observed with CuB treatment (Fig. 3A-D). The ILK1/YB-1/Twist signaling axis has been known to regulate HER2 expression in breast cancer cells. Our results showed that higher HER2 inhibition was observed at 48h in only those cell lines where TWIST along with ILK or YB1 were also inhibited. These observations suggest that inhibition of HER2 by CuB was associated with the inhibition of ILK1/YB-1 signaling.Suppression of HER2 and associated signaling by CuB treatment: (A) MDA-MB-231 (B) SKBR3 (C) MCF-7 and (D) 4T-1 cells were treated with varying concentrations of CuB for 48 or 72hRepresentative blots showing concentration dependent effect of CuB on HER2, EGFR, phospho EGFR (Y992) TACE, phosho-Src (Y416), Src, phospho-P130CAS (Y410), ILK1, phosphor-YB1 (S102), YB-1 and Twist. Histone H3 was used as a loading control. Each experiment was repeated atleast three times independently.CuB suppresses ITGA6B4To evaluate the role of CuB on integrin signaling, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells were treated with CuB for 48 and 72h. Our results showed that CuB significantly suppressed the expression of ITGA6 and ITGB4 as compared to other integrins in the cell lines tested in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A-D). The other integrins were either not affected at all or very modest changes were observed by CuB treatment. These results indicate that CuB causes specific inhibition of ITGA6 and ITGB4, which interestingly are overexpressed in breast cancer and interacts with HER2. On the other hand, the pro-apoptotic ITGB1 and ITGB3 were induced in a time-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells after treatment with similar concentrations of CuB. Although, significant induction of ITGB1 was observed at 48h treatment with CuB in MCF-7 cells, cleavage of caspase 8 or apoptosis did not correlated as compared with other cells. The induction of pro-apoptotic ITGB1 and ITGB3 by CuB treatment suggests activation of integrins mediated cell death by CuB in MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and 4T-1 breast cancer cells.CuB suppresses integrin \u03b16/\u03b24 expression: (A) MDA-MB-231 (B) SKBR3 (C) MCF-7 and (D) 4T-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of CuB for 48 or 72hThe proteins in cell lysates were separated using western blot. The blots were immune-probed for the integrins ITGB1 (integrin \u03b21), ITGA5 (integrin \u03b15), ITGAV (integrin \u03b1v), ITGB3 (integrin \u03b23), ITGB5 (integrin \u03b25), ITGA6 (integrin \u03b16), ITGB4 (integrin \u03b24) and Histone H3 was used as the loading control. Each experiment was repeated atleast three times independently.CuB inhibits TGF\u03b2 mediated interaction of HER2 with ITGA6Since TGF\u03b2 is known to activate HER2/integrin signaling, we evaluated the interaction of HER2 with integrins. TGF\u03b2 treatment significantly increased the expression of ITGA6 by about 1.5 fold in MDA-MB-231 and 4T-1 cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, when HER2 was immune-precipitated from TGF\u03b2 treated cells, we observed that TGF\u03b2 treatment increased the expression of ITGA6 associated with HER2 (Fig. 5B). However, this interaction was inhibited by CuB treatment (Fig. 5C). These observations propose a novel mechanism of tumor promotion by TGF\u03b2 by increasing the association between ITGA6 and HER2, possibly due to induction of ITGA6. Our results thus provide a novel insight into TGF\u03b2-mediated physical interaction between HER2 and ITGA6. However, further studies are required to confirm the detailed mechanism and implications of this interaction.CuB inhibits TGF\u03b2-mediated interaction of HER2 and integrin \u03b16(A) TGF\u03b2 treatment induces expression of integrin \u03b16 in MDA-MB-231 and 4T-1 cells. (B) HER2 was immune-precipitated from MDA-MB-231 cell lysate with or without TGF\u03b2 treatment after 48h and the protein was separated using western blot. The blots were probed for ITGA6. IgG was used as the loading control. (C) HER2 was immune-precipitated from cell lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without treatment with TGF\u03b2 and CuB for 48h. The protein was separated using western blotting and the blots were probed for ITGA6 and HER2. IgG was used as the loading control (D) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated alone or in combination with TGF\u03b2 and CuB for 48h. The proteins in cell lysates were separated using western blot. The blots were probed for ITGB4, ITGA6, HER2, TACE, EGFR, phospho paxillin (Y118), phospho YB1 (S102), ILK1, phospho Src (Y416), phospho P130CAS (Y410), Caspase 8 (cleaved) and Caspase 3 (full-length). Histone H3 was used as a loading control. Each experiment was repeated atleast three times independently.To determine the effect of CuB on integrin signaling in presence of TGF\u03b2, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with CuB (50nM) after treatment with TGF\u03b2 (10ng/ml). Our results indicate that TGF\u03b2 significantly blocked CuB-mediated inhibition of ITGA6, HER2, TACE, ILK1 and phosphoP130CAS (Y410) (Fig. 5D).Inhibition of integrin signaling by CuBNext we tested the effects of CuB on downstream signaling of integrins in breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, MCF-7 and 4T-1 cells were treated with various concentrations of CuB for 48 or 72h. As shown in Fig. 6A-D, CuB treatment suppressed the expression and phosphorylation of paxillin at Y-118 (Fig. 6A-D). A significant down-regulation of ILK1 was also observed by CuB treatment. ILK1-paxillin complex regulated by integrins serves as a major mechanism for various cell survival processes. CuB also inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT at S-473 and ERK at T-202/204 (Fig. 6A-D). Both AKT and ERK are important downstream targets of ILK1-paxillin complex. Consistently, CuB treatment suppressed the phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at S-9 while enhancing its protein level in a concentration and time dependent manner (Fig. 6A-D). AKT is known to negatively regulate GSK3\u03b2 in cancer cells. CuB also suppressed ROCK1 and RhoA kinases which play important role in cell motility (Fig. 6A-D). Both the kinases are known to be activated by integrins and are important targets of Akt.CuB inhibits integrin signaling cascade: (A) MDA-MB-231 (B) SKBR3 (C) MCF-7 and (D) 4T-1 cells were treated with various concentrations of CuB for 48 or 72hThe cell proteins were separated using western blot. The blots were immune-probed for phospho paxillin (Y118), paxillin, ILK1, phospho Akt (S473), Akt, phospho ERK (T202/204), phospho GSK3\u03b2 (S9), GSK3 \u03b2, ROCK1 and RhoA. Histone H3 was used as the loading control. Each experiment was repeated at least three times independently.CuB inhibits breast tumor growth in miceTo test the efficacy of CuB in vivo, two breast tumor experiments were performed. In the first experiment, 5X106 MDA-MB-231 cells were injected orthotopically in the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice. Once each mouse attained palpable tumors, mice were randomly divided into two groups with ten mice in each group. Treatment group received 2mg/kg CuB everyday by oral gavage. The tumor growth was monitored by measuring tumor volumes periodically. Our results showed that oral gavage of CuB significantly reduced the growth of breast tumors (Fig. 7A). At day 60 of the treatment, tumor volume in the treated group was reduced by 55% as compared to the control group [249.5\u00b130.3mm3 vs 111.3\u00b118.4mm3; (n=10)] (Fig. 7Ai). The weight of the MDA-MB-231 tumors dissected from treated mice was about 53% less than the weight of tumors from control mice (Fig. 7Aii). The weight of mice did not change significantly with oral gavage, indicating no apparent systemic toxicity in CuB-treated mice (Fig. 7Aiii). In the other experiment, 0.1X106 4T-1 breast cancer cells were injected in the mammary fat pads of female BALB/c mice. 4T-1 cells are highly aggressive and considered to be late stage breast cancer. Once each mouse attained palpable tumors, mice were segregated into two groups with eight mice in each group. 1mg/kg CuB was given intraperitoneally, every third day to the mice of treatment group and the growth of the tumors monitored. The growth of tumors in CuB treated group was reduced significantly as compared to control group (Fig. 7B). For example, at day 28 of the treatment, 4T-1 tumor volume in the treated group was reduced by 39% as compared to control group [2355.3\u00b1236.4mm3 vs 1446.7\u00b1142.6mm3; (n=8)] (Fig. 7Bi). Similarly, the weight of the tumors in treated mice was reduced by 27% (Fig. 7Bii & iv). A transitory reduction in weight was observed in the mice receiving i.p. administration of CuB as compared to control, which ameliorated with time (Fig. 7Biii). Since the weight of the mice dropped initially after intraperitoneal administration, we decided to evaluate the mice of treated group for any signs of gross toxicity. The organs of control and treated mice were weighed once the experiment was terminated. No change in the weight of organs like liver, spleen, kidney, lungs, brain and heart were observed in CuB treated mice as compared to control mice (Table 1). The enzymatic activities of AST, ALT and LDH were also evaluated in the plasma of control and CuB treated mice. Although, no significant change in the activity of ALT and AST was observed, interestingly, plasma LDH level was reduced by 24.3% in the mice of CuB treated group (Table 2). The exact reasons behind the decrease in LDH level by CuB treatment was not clear and require further studies.CuB suppresses breast tumor growth(A) About 5X106 MDA-MB-231 cells were orthotopically implanted in the mammary fat pad of female athymic nude mice. Once each mouse had a tumor of about 50-80mm3, 2mg/kg CuB was administered by oral gavage every day. Tumors were measured periodically and each mouse was weighed every week. Effect of CuB on (i) tumor volume, (ii) tumor weight and (iii) mice weight. (B) About 0.1X106 4T-1 cells were orthotopically implanted in the mammary fat pad of female BALB/c mice. Once each mouse had a tumor of about 30-50mm3, 1mg/kg CuB was injected by i.p route every third day. Tumors were measured periodically and each mouse was weighed every week.

The tumor sections from CuB treated mice showed reduced expression of HER2 and ITGB4 in MDA-MB-231 as well as 4T-1 tumor sections (Fig. 8 A & B). Our western blot results also confirmed that the expression of HER2, ITGA6 and ITGB4 were suppressed in the tumors of CuB treated mice (Fig. 8A & B). Tumor lysates from CuB treated mice also revealed suppression of phospho YB-1 (S-102) and Twist, which are known to regulate HER2 expression in breast cancer cells. In addition to suppression of HER2-associated signaling, CuB treatment also inhibited integrins' downstream signaling molecules like phospho paxillin (Y118) and ILK1 in the tumors. The induction of apoptosis by CuB treatment was confirmed through down-regulation of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase 3 in the tumors of CuB treated mice. Taken together, these results indicate that the breast tumor growth suppression by CuB in vivo was associated with the inhibition of HER2/integrin signaling validating our in vitro observations.In vivo suppression of HER2-Integrin signaling by CuB treatment: Tumors were removed after the termination of the experimentTumors were minced, lysed and analyzed for HER2, ITGA6, ITGB4, phospho paxillin (Y118), phospho YB1 (S102), ILK, Twist, Bcl2 and Caspase 3. Blots were stripped and re-probed with Histone H3 antibody to verify equal protein loading. (A) Each lane of blot represents a tumor sample from individual mouse.

The complex of ILK1 and Paxillin orchestrates the downstream effects of integrins. Symbol represents the targets inhibited by CuB.DISCUSSIONHER2 overexpression is observed in about one-fourth of breast cancer patients and is a major cause for poor prognosis. The crosstalk of HER2 with several other growth signaling pathways results in extremely aggressive form of cancer, imparting high resistance to conventional therapeutic modalities. Our study identified a unique HER2-integrin signaling axis in breast cancer that was inhibited by CuB, a novel steroidal triterpenoid compound.Several previous studies used CuB extracted from plants instead of using commercially available pure compound to evaluate cytotoxicity. Tannin-Spitz et. al. used the plant extract to evaluate the cytotoxic properties of CuB. This study showed an IC50 of 8\u03bcM in MDA-MB-231 cells after 48h of treatment. On the other hand, Promkan et al. observed an IC50 of 70\u03bcM (38.9\u03bcg/ml) after 48h of treatment. In contrast to these studies, our study showed significantly reduced effective concentrations of CuB. The IC50 of CuB after 72h of treatment ranged between 18nM and 50nM in most of the breast cancer cell lines tested. Our results are in agreement with the IC50 observed by Wakimoto et. al., who used pure CuB. Hence, differences in the IC50 of CuB in the published literature could be attributed to the purity of CuB and cancer model. We observed that CuB was effective in 4T-1 cells at slightly higher concentrations as compared to other cell lines. This could be due to several reasons: 4T-1 cells overexpress p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and hence is resistant to several chemotherapeutic agents. It is possible that CuB could be the substrate for P-gp, leading to a requirement of higher concentrations of CuB in this cell line. Secondly, 4T-1 is a very aggressive and resistant cell line as compared to other cells used in our study, thus needing more CuB to suppress its growth.Our studies showed that CuB treatment induced caspase mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Apoptosis was confirmed through cleavage of caspase 8 and inhibition of full-length caspase 3. It is known that Bcl2 and survivin play a crucial role in caspase inhibition and their inhibition leads to activation of caspases. We observed significant reduction of these proteins by CuB treatment. Although, SKBR3 cells expressed low constitutive levels of Bcl2 and survivin, the apoptosis inducing effect of CuB was not compromised in SKBR3 cells, suggesting the role of other intermediary molecules. BAX is an important protein that regulates the activation of caspases and accumulation of BAX leads to apoptosis. On the other hand, several studies have shown that cleavage of BAX mediated by caspases and calpains also plays a critical role in apoptosis.Our results showed a concentration-dependent cleavage of BAX by CuB treatment in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells. However, the cleavage of BAX was not observed in MCF-7 cells. This is not surprising as MCF-7 is a caspase 3 null cell line. Cleavage of BAX by CuB was significantly blocked by caspase 3 inhibitor. These observations suggest a direct role of caspase 3 in BAX cleavage induced by CuB treatment. However, further studies are required to confirm the mechanism and implications of BAX cleavage by CuB.Our results indicated TGF\u03b2 mediated interaction of HER2 with integrins. HER2 utilizes multiple mechanisms to enhance tumorigenicity. Kalra et. al. have shown that ILK1 regulates HER2 expression by coordinating the molecular functions of TWIST and YB-1. In agreement, our results showed that CuB treatment inhibited ILK1/YB-1/TWIST signaling, which can explain the down-regulation of HER2 in our model.Furthermore, the tumorigenicity by EGFR family of receptors is known to be mediated by Src kinase and Src inhibition can lead to suppression of tumorigenicity. Our results demonstrated significant inhibition of Src expression and phosphorylation by CuB treatment. These changes were accompanied with suppression of phosphorylated P130CAS, the downstream effector molecule of Src kinase. Interestingly, TACE dependent ligand shedding is also known to play role in regulating HER2-integrin signaling in breast cancer. We observed suppression of TACE expression by CuB treatment in all the breast cancer cell lines tested. These observations suggest significant influence of CuB treatment on HER2 and related signaling in breast cancer irrespective of genotypes and phenotypes of various breast cancer cells used in our studies.Integrins are the master regulators of various cellular processes. ITGA6B4 has been recently identified to play a significant role in breast cancer progression through diverse mechanisms. ITGB4 is of special prognostic significance in basal type breast cancer exemplified by MDA-MB-231 cells used in this study. Evidence suggests that HER2 is present at the crossroad of integrin signaling in breast cancer. Guo et. al. demonstrated that ITGB4 augments HER2 signaling to promote breast cancer progression, while another study by Wang et. al. demonstrated augmentation of ITGA6B4 by HER2. Furthermore, a study supports the physical interaction of HER2 with ITGA6, ITGB1 and ITGB4, which can be augmented by TGF\u03b2. These studies also suggest that inhibition of the interaction of HER2 with integrins can be exploited for therapeutic advantage. Our studies confirm the interaction of HER2 with ITGA6. Interestingly, we made a unique observation that TGF\u03b2 treatment also increased the constitutive expression of ITGA6, which might be the reason of enhanced interaction of ITGA6 with HER2 by TGF\u03b2 treatment. Nonetheless, this interaction was inhibited by CuB treatment. Our observations confirm the interplay between HER2 and integrin \u03b16\u03b24 in breast cancer cells, while suggesting a direct role of TGF\u03b2 in enhancing the interaction. Our results also suggest that inhibition of HER2 interaction with these integrins can serve as a powerful mechanism for anti-cancer therapeutics.In addition to cross-talk with HER2, integrin heterodimers also enhance cell survival by direct signaling. The cytoplasmic domains of heterodimers of \u03b2 integrins can interact with adaptor proteins like ILK (Integrin linked Kinase) and paxillin to enhance survival signals through AKT and ERK, leading to inactivation of GSK3\u03b2 and activation of Rho kinases like ROCK1 and RhoA. Our data clearly shows inhibition of ILK1, paxillin, Akt, ERK and Rho kinases while inducing GSK3\u03b2 by CuB treatment in breast cancer cells. Our time-dependent study indicated that HER2 inhibition was more prominent at 48h of CuB treatment whereas, inhibition of integrins was more at 72h. Therefore, these results suggest that inhibition of integrin followed HER2 inhibition, indicating a link between these pathways.Interestingly, ITGB1 and ITGB3 have been shown to induce apoptosis through recruitment of caspase8, the process known as integrin-mediated death (IMD). We observed an increase in the expression of ITGB1, ITGB3 and cleavage of caspase 8 by CuB treatment in MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and 4T-1 cells, suggesting CuB mediated IMD. However, further studies are required to confirm this mechanism.Zhang et. al. used 1mg/kg CuB through intraperitoneal injection thrice a week against melanoma tumors. They observed about 50% suppression of tumor growth after 23 days. Kausar et. al. observed that treatment with 1mg/kg CuB every alternate day for 5 weeks reduced the volume of non-small lung carcinoma tumor xenografts by 70%. Furthermore, as shown by Aribi et. al., CuB suppressed MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor volume by 42% and 55% at dose of 0.5 and 1mg/kg (i.p.) respectively after 36 days of treatment. In agreement to this study, we also observed a 55% reduction in tumor volumes when 2mg/kg CuB was administered orally every day for 60 days. In addition, in another orthotopic tumor experiment, we employed murine breast cancer cell line 4T-1, which represents late stage aggressive breast carcinoma, and treated the mice with 1mg/kg CuB i.p., every third day. After 28 days, the average tumor volume in treated mice was found to be about 39% reduced as compared to tumors in control mice. Our two different in vivo tumor experiments confirm the anti-breast tumor properties of CuB. The tumors of CuB treated mice exhibited inhibitions of HER2/integrins signaling, validating our in vitro observations. The two tumor models used in this study displayed significantly different tumor growth kinetics. However, CuB suppressed the tumor growth in both the models by inhibiting HER2/integrin signaling.Taken together, our results indicate inhibition of HER2-integrin signaling as a novel anti-cancer mechanism of CuB in breast cancer cells. The HER2 inhibition correlates with suppression of ITGA6 and ITGB4, which further lead to inhibition of integrin-mediated cell survival through ILK1 and paxillin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells through HER2-integrin signaling inhibition.MATERIALS AND METHODSEthics StatementExperiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards and according to approved protocol by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).Cell cultureHuman breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were purchased from ATCC and recently authenticated by STR analysis by our core facility. SKBR3 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Terumi Kohwi-Shigematsu (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA). These cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% PSN. The 4T-1 cells were purchased from Perkin Elmers (Santa Clara, CA, USA). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% PSN. All the cells used in this study were within twenty passages after receipt or resuscitation. The cells were maintained and passaged in culture as described by us previously.MCF-7 is an ER positive cell line with wild type p53 while MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 are ER negative cells and harbor mutated p53. 4T-1 cells are triple negative and p53 null murine cells representing stage IV metastatic breast cancer.Cytotoxicity StudiesCells were plated at a density of 2000-3000 cells/well in 96 well plates and allowed to attach overnight and treated with different concentrations (0-100nM) of Cucurbitacin B (CuB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for various time intervals. The cells were fixed with ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed and stained with sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye and the optical density was measured in Tris base solution using plate reader, after washing the dye with 1% acetic acid solution as described by us previously.Annexin-FITC apoptosis assayApoptosis assay was performed using a kit (BD Biosciences, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Approximately, 0.1x106 cells were plated in 6-well plate and left overnight for attachment. After treatment for 48 and 72h with 0-75nM CuB, cells were harvested after trypsinization, washed and suspended in binding buffer to have cell density of 1x106/ml. A 5.0\u03bcl of Annexin V-FITC and 5\u03bcl of propidium iodide (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were added to the 100\u03bcl of suspension and incubated for additional 20 min at room temperature in dark. Total sample volume was made up to 200\u03bcl with binding buffer. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometer after vortexing (Accuri C6, MI).Western Blot AnalysisVarious breast cancer cells were treated with varying concentrations of CuB (0, 25, 50 and 75nM except for 4T-1 cells, which were treated with 0, 40, 80 and 150nM) for 48 or 72h. The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 50nM Q-VD-OPH, a caspase 3 inhibitor (Apoptrol, Enon, OH), 1h prior to treatment with CuB and the cells were collected after 48h. In another experiment, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10ng/ml TGF\u03b2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 1h prior to the treatment with 50nM CuB for 48h. Whole cell lysates were prepared using 4% (w/v) CHAPS buffer while tumor lysates were prepared by homogenizing the tumors in RIPA lysis buffer. Proteins from control and treated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the segregated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was developed as described by us previously. All antibodies used in the study were purchased from Cell signaling except HER2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), ITGB4 (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), TWIST (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), phospho Akt (S473) (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and Caspase 3 (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX).Immune-precipitationImmune-precipitation was performed as described by us previously. Briefly, 0.5x106 MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 100 mm petridish and treated with 10ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 1h prior to the treatment with 50nM CuB. After 48h CuB treatment, whole cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer and immune-precipitated with HER2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Immune complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immune-blotted for ITGA6.Tumor therapy modelFemale athymic nude mice (4-6 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Ban harbor, Maine, USA) and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. The use of athymic nude mice and their treatment was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, and the experiments were conducted in strict compliance with the regulations. Mice were given antioxidant-free AIN-76A special diet (TestDiet, Richmond, IN) one week before starting the experiment. Exponentially growing MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested, washed and resuspended in PBS at a density of 50x106 cells per ml with 80% matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). A suspension of 0.1mL containing 5x106 cells was injected in the mammary fat pads of the recipient mice. Tumor volumes and animal weights were measured twice a week as described by us previously. When the tumors reached a size of about 50-80 mm3, mice were randomly segregated into two groups with ten mice in each group. Test group of mice received 2mg/kg CuB in PBS by oral gavage every day till day 60, whereas control mice received vehicle alone. Mice were sacrificed on day 60 by CO2 overdose and death was confirmed by cervical dislocation in accordance with IACUC guidelines. The tumors were dissected out aseptically from each mouse, weighed and snap frozen in liquid-nitrogen for western blot analysis.In another experiment, female BALB/c mice (4-6 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Ban harbor, Maine, USA) and maintained under controlled humidity and temperature conditions. The use of BALB/c mice and their treatment was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, and the experiments were conducted in strict compliance with the regulations. Exponentially growing 4T-1 cells were harvested, washed and re-suspended in PBS at a density of 1x106 cells per ml with 50% matrigel. A suspension of 0.1mL containing 0.1x106 cells was injected in the mammary fat pads of the recipient mice. Tumor volumes and animal weights were measured every alternate day as described by us previously. When the tumors reached a size of about 30-50 mm3, mice were randomly segregated into two groups with eight mice in each group. The treatment group of mice received 1mg/kg CuB in PBS by i.p. injection every third day till day 28. The control mice received vehicle alone. Mice were sacrificed on day 28 by CO2 overdose and death was confirmed by cervical dislocation in accordance with IACUC guidelines. The tumors were removed aseptically from each mouse, weighed and snap frozen in liquid-nitrogen for further analysis.ImmunohistochemistryThe immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as previously described by our lab. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were sectioned into 5\u03bcm thick sections using microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated by performing three washes of xylene for 5 minutes each, two washes of 100% ethanol for 10 minutes followed by two washes of 95% ethanol for 10 minutes and the sections were given two 5 minute washes in double-distilled water (dH2O). Antigens were unmasked by boiling the sections in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) followed by incubating the sections at room temperature for about 30 minutes for cooling down. The slides were washed in dH2O three times for 5 minutes each, then incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution in methanol for 10 minutes followed by two washes in dH2O for 5 minutes each. Tumor sections were then washed twice in wash buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) for 5 minutes each, blocked in 200 \u03bcL of blocking solution (5% goat serum diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin solution in PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature, and incubated with anti\u2013HER2 (1:150) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or anti-ITGB4 antibody (1:150) (Santacruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next day primary antibody was removed and the sections were washed three times in wash buffer for 10 minutes each followed by incubation with Ultravision ONE HRP polymer (Thermofisher scientific, Fremont, CA) for 30 minutes. Subsequently, sections were washed with wash buffer and incubated with DAB Plus chromogen as per the manufacturer's instructions for 15-20 minutes. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated by incubating in 95% ethanol followed by two incubations in 100% ethanol for 5 minutes each and final incubation was done in xylene for 5 minutes. The slides were mounted using Permount (Fisher scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) and analyzed under a phase-contrast Olympus microscope (Olympus America Inc).Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Although hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy have significantly improved efficacy in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy resistance is still a substantial challenge in the face of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which hormone therapy is not available. Chemotherapy resistance is becoming increasingly common and involves a variety of mechanisms, including P-glycoprotein-dependent drug efflux, DNA damage and repair, epigenetic changes and apoptosis disorders. In these mechanisms, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are activated fibroblasts, also play an important role in promoting the drug resistance of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs can lead to chemotherapy resistance in tumor cells by secreting exosomes and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and HGF. CAFs can create obstacles to chemotherapeutic drug delivery. CAFs can lead to leakage in tumor blood vessels and decrease the concentration of intravenous drugs. In addition, CAFs can also increase collagen secretion in solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer, enhance the density of tumor tissues, reduce vascular density, and pressure the tumor vascular system.Atractylenolide-I (ATL-1) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz [Family: Compositae] that has been applied in anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antitumor treatments. ATL-1 has antitumor effects on a variety of cancers, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. ATL-1 can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, ATL-1 was found to reduce the dryness of tumor cells and increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. However, the antitumor mechanism of ATL-1, especially the specific mechanism by which it increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, is still unclear and requires further study. ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. So we wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation in tumor microenvironment.Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the CCN family. Initially, CTGF was found to promote tissue fibrosis and harden tissue structures. As a secreted protein, CTGF also plays important roles in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, CTGF can promote the proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells; on the other hand, CTGF can induce chemotherapy resistance. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with lower CTGF expression are more sensitive to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. CTGF can regulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes in tumor cells. CTGF can also induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. CTGF expression is increased in CAFs and negatively correlated with disease-free survival. It has also been reported that CTGF can induce autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by changing the metabolism of CAFs. CAFs have a role in inducing chemotherapy resistance, which explains the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance induction by CTGF from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment.Our previous clinical trials have proven that Huatan Sanjie decoction based on Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz can significantly increase the sensitivity of patients with TNBC to paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, we examined the effect of ATL-I, which is the main component of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, on oncogene expression in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR. We found that ATL-I could significantly reduce the CTGF mRNA level in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. Through functional experiments, we found that ATL- I could significantly reduce the migration of TNBC cells, downregulate the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. Therefore, we speculated that ATL- I could play a chemotherapy-sensitizing role by downregulating CTGF.Materials and MethodsChemicals and AntibodiesAtractylenolide-I (AT-I, purity > 98%) and paclitaxel (purity > 98%) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

The relative mRNA levels obtained by qRT-PCR were used to calculate the normalized log2 ratios. The calculation process was as follows:The relative mRNA levels of each gene were calculated by 2\u2013\u0394Ct method, whereThen the log2 ratios (mRNA levels with ATL-1 treatment/mRNA levels without ATL-1 treatment) were as follows:whereIt should be noticed that, each of three biological replicates were performed for the group with ATL-1 treatment and the group without ATL-1 treatment. One of the biological replicate in group without ATL-1 treatment was chose as the standard, then the mRNA level of the other two biological replicates without ATL-1 treatment and the three biological replicates with ATL-1 treatment were all calculated the log2 ratio to this standard. The log2 ratio of the standard to itself was zero.At last, all of the calculated log2 ratios were dealt with Z-score normalization:Gi means the log2 ratio of one of the replicate of gene G. Mean and SD were calculated using the six calculated log2 ratios of gene G (three in group with ATL-1 treatment and three in group without ATL-1 treatment). The normalized log2 ratio was then shown in different colors in the heatmap, which was drawn by Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA). Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. The\u00a0gene-specific primer sequences used in the heatmap are listed in  Supplementary Table S2 .Western BlottingEqual amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies against CTGF (1:1000, ab209780), \u03b1-SMA (1:5000, ab124964), FAP (1:1000, ab207178) and \u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, TA-10), and then with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, ZB-2301) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, ZB-2305) antibodies for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate was used to visualize the blots with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system (Hercules, CA, USA). Protein expression levels were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at an appropriate density, resulting in 80% confluence within 16-24 hours. When the cell confluence reached 70-80%, rinsed the cell layer with PBS and cultured the cells in 5 mL fresh serum-free medium. Supernatants were harvested 24 hours later and used for subsequent ELISA. The secreted CTGF protein levels in the medium were measured with a Human CTGF ELISA kit. The total protein concentration was also examined, and then the concentrations of secreted protein of different samples were normalized to corresponding total protein.Lentiviral TransductionThe pLV-EF1\u03b1-CTGF-CMV-Puro lentiviral plasmid (CTGF-OE), negative control lentiviral plasmid (NC), CTGF-specific shRNAs (sh-CTGF), negative control shRNAs and the according lentivirus were purchased from Shanghai GeneChem Co. (Shanghai, China). Viral titres of approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 infectious units/ml were obtained. Lentivirus infection was performed with polybrene according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3-5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and cultured for 16-24 hours. Then, the culture medium was replaced with 480 \u03bcL fresh culture medium and 20\u03bcL polybrene (25\u00d7) per well. Lentivirus was then added to the culture medium at MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 20 (MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells) or 10 (HFF1 and WI-38 cells).Cells were incubated for 16 hours with lentivirus. Then the culture medium containing lentivirus was replaced with 1 mL fresh culture medium per well for the continuous culture. The stably transfected cells were selected by 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for 7 days. The sequences of CTGF-specific shRNAs are listed in  Table S3 .Transwell Migration AssayTranswell migration assays were performed using a 24-well Transwell chamber with a pore size of 8 \u00b5m (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105) were maintained in serum-free culture medium in the upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cancer cells were allowed to migrate for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells that had failed to migrate were removed from the upper chamber with swabs; the remaining cells on the bottom side of the basement membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet. The cells in the lower portion of transwell membrane were counted. A random selection of 3\u20135 fields were photographed and counted under the microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan).Co-Culture ExperimentsCo-culture was carried out as described by Su et\u00a0al.. Co-culture experiments were performed using 6-well or 24-well Transwell chambers with a 0.4-\u00b5m pore size (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Taking 6-well Transwell chambers for example, TNBC cells (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the lower chamber with 2.5 mL culture medium, and fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber with 1.5 mL culture medium. DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was used for HS578T and WI-38 cells co-culture experiments. DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS was used for MDA-MB-231 and HFF1 cells co-culture experiments.CCK8 AssayCell Counting Kit-8 was bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates or 24-well plates at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells/mL with indicated treatment. Six to eight parallel wells were assigned to each group. At different time points, the culture medium was replaced with 100 \u03bcl fresh medium per 96 well or 500 \u03bcl fresh medium per 24 well. Then, CCK-8 solution (10\u2009\u03bcl per 96 well or 50\u2009\u03bcl per 24 well) was added, followed by incubation for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. A multiplate reader (Flexstation\u00ae 3, Molecular Devices, LLC., San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure absorbance at 450\u2009nm.Trypan Blue Exclusion AssayAdherent cells were digested with trypsin into a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was mixed with a 0.4% trypan blue solution at a ratio of 9:1. The live and dead cells were counted within 3 minutes. The proportion of live cells was then calculated. In Vivo AssayMDA-MB-231 cells (6 \u00d7 106) were implanted into the fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/c mice. Tumor volumes were measured every three days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3) = (length \u00d7 height2)/2. When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. once per week. ATL-1 was given at 50 mg/kg i.p. once daily as described by Li Y et\u00a0al.. After 6 weeks of treatment, all the animals were sacrificed. Partial fresh primary tumors were used for primary culture of fibroblasts as described by Calvo et\u00a0al.. Partial primary tumors and mouse organs were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for subsequent analysis.Primary Culture of Cancer-Associated FibroblastsPrimary culture was carried out as described by Calvo et\u00a0al., with some modifications. Tumor samples were cut into small pieces and digested by collagenase/dispase. Then, 44 \u03bcm nylon meshes were used to remove undigested tissue. After centrifuging at 1000 rpm/min for 10\u00a0min, the filtered cells were collected and then re-suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured in the culture dish. Thirty minutes later, the fibroblasts had already adhered to the culture dish, while other cell types remained in suspension. Afterward, the culture media were changed and fibroblasts were cultured for subsequent experiments.Statistical AnalysisData were assessed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Adobe Illustrator CC 2018 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used to represent the data. Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between each two groups. Error bars in the experiments indicate standard deviation (SD). Any values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsATL-1 Inhibited Tumor Cell Migration and Increased the Sensitivity of Tumor Cells to PaclitaxelAs shown in  Figures\u00a01A, B , we found that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 significantly inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays. We chose 50\u03bcM as the ATL-1 concentration for subsequent experiments. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HFF1 and WI38 cells), and then examined the growth effects of ATL-1 on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CCK8 assays. We found 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on TNBC cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a01C ,  S1A ). We then examined the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. We found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel for 48 hrs, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was lower than that of TNBC cells cultured alone (-)( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was higher than that of TNBC cells cultured alone ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). However, we found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel in co-cultured systems, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment was higher than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells with ATL-1 treatment was lower than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). These data suggested that ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on TNBC cells in co-culture systems.ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. Wound healing (A) and Transwell migration (B) assays showed that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 reduced the migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells. (C) CCK8 assays showed that 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells). (D) CCK8 assays showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells) with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (E) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs.

The normalized log2 ratio and p value for significantly downregulated genes were shown in  Table S1 . We found that the CTGF mRNA level was significantly decreased after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs ( Figure\u00a02A ). qRT-PCR and Western blotting verified the downregulation of CTGF at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells following ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a02B, C ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a02D ).ATL-1 downregulates CTGF expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell migration via CTGF. (A) Heatmaps of migration-related gene-expressions from MDA-MB-231 qRT-PCR analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with/without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24\u00a0h.

Mean \u00b1 SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to without ATL-1 treatment by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFWe wondered whether ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration via CTGF. We found that recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) could rescue the downregulation of cancer cell migration by ATL-1 in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays ( Figures\u00a03A, B ). To further determine the role of CTGF, we overexpressed the expression of CTGF with CTGF-OE lentivirus in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a03C ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a03C ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated in CTGF-OE cells ( Figures\u00a03D, E ). We also knocked down the expression of CTGF with shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells ( Figure S2A ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs ( Figures S2B, C ). These data further confirmed that CTGF mediated the inhibitory effect of ATL-1 on tumor cell migration.ATL-1 inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell migration via CTGF. Wound healing (A) and transwell migration (B) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were rescued by rCTGF. (C) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CTGF-OE lentivirus. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. Wound healing (D) and Transwell migration (E) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were attenuated in CTGF-OE cells. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates.

We found that CTGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased by ATL-1 treatment in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a04A, B ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a04C ). To mimic fibroblast transformation in the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts for 2 days and then examined the mRNA and protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA. Firstly, we examined the effect of recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) on the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs in co-culture systems. We found that the treatment with rCTGF (higher than 5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 days could significantly increase the mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, and we chose 10 \u03bcg/mL for the subsequence experiments ( Supplementary Figures S3A, B ). Then, we examined the effects of ATL-1 on fibroblasts transformation. We found that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 2 days dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, which could be rescued by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a04D, E ;  Supplementary Figure S3C ).ATL-1 downregulates fibroblast expression of CTGF and inhibits the ability of breast cancer cells to transform fibroblasts into CAF-like cells. (A) qPCR illustrated downregulation of CTGF mRNA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (B) and ELISA (C) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. qRT-PCR (D) demonstrated that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the mRNA levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. Western blotting (E) demonstrated that co-culture with cancer cells upregulated the protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. Treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the protein levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. rCTGF rescued the downregulation. (-) in (E) represent without ATL-1 and rCTGF treatment. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates.

All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that the addition of ATL-1 could obviously increase the inhibition rates of TNBC cells in the co-culture systems, which could be attenuated by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a05A ,  S4A ). We then overexpressed CTGF expression with CTGF-OE lentivirus in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a05B ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a05B ). We examined the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel with CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that when TNBC cells were co-cultured with NC fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were reduced by ATL-1 treatment. While, when TNBC cells were co-cultured with CTGF-OE fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were no longer reduced by ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a05C, D ;  Figures S4B, C ). We also knocked down CTGF expression with shRNAs in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figure S5A ) and found that the ATL-1-driven chemosensitization in co-cultured systems could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs acting on fibroblasts ( Figures S5B, C ). These data suggest that CTGF secreted by fibroblasts mediates the chemosensitizing effect of ATL-1 on TNBC cells.ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. CCK8 (A) assay showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment and rCTGF treatment for 48 hrs. (B) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF expression was overexpressed in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. (C) CCK8 showed the IC50 of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (D) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone(\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. ATL-1 increased the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel in co-culture systems (NC), which was attenuated by the overexpression of CTGF in fibroblasts (CTGF-OE). (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.Atractylenolide-I Sensitizes Triple-Negative Breast Cancer to Paclitaxel in a Mouse ModelFinally, we analyzed the effect of ATL-1 on chemosensitivity in vivo. We found that in model mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells, paclitaxel treatment inhibited tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases. ATL-1 dramatically enhanced these inhibitory effects ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). However, ATL-1 alone had no effect on tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). Western blotting showed that ATL-1 could reduce CTGF protein levels in primary tumors ( Figure\u00a06C ). In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 alone (ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from control tumors (control) ( Figure\u00a06D ). And primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 in combination with paclitaxel (paclitaxel+ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from tumors treated with paclitaxel alone (paclitaxel) ( Figure\u00a06D ).Atractylenolide-I sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer to paclitaxel in a mouse model. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female Balb/c mice (n = 6).

Long F et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. ATL-1 was found to inhibit melanoma and colorectal cancer cell proliferation via the JAK2/STAT3 or AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Ye Y et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells via ERK/GSK3beta signaling. Ma L et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could attenuate gastric cancer stem cell traits via the Notch pathway. However, the effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied.We found that ATL-1 could significantly increase the sensitivity to paclitaxel in triple-negative breast cancer in co-cultured systems. Huang JM et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 sensitized human ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel by blocking activation of the TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in cancer cells. However, we found that when TNBC cells were cultured alone, ATL-1 was not enough to affect the sensitivity to paclitaxel in TNBC cells. This may be due to the difference in cell types. We are the first to find that ATL-1 could affect chemotherapy sensitivity through fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. We found that ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast transformation into CAFs. Guo Y et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could repress the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys by targeting fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD), as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which supports our findings. We found the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 is inseparable from co-cultured with fibroblasts. We speculate that the addition of ATL-1 could downregulate the expression and secretion levels of CTGF, which could inhibit fibroblasts transform to CAF. The change in fibroblasts\u2019 transformation level could alter some proteins or exosomes secreted by fibroblasts, which in turn affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. The verification of this hypothesis needs further experiments. It has been reported that CAFs could induce chemoresistance by secreting IL-6, IL-8, HGF and exosomes, which explains our findings supporting the conclusion that ATL-1 could inhibit chemotherapy resistance via fibroblasts.To explain the biological function of ATL-1 we have discovered, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. Firstly we examined the genes that were involved in our past or on-going experiments. As shown in  Figure\u00a02A , most of these genes are classic genes closely related to cell migration. The down-regulation of these classic genes by ATL-1 can prove our observation to a certain extent that ATL-1 inhibits cell migration. In addition, most of these classic genes are associated not only with tumor cell migration but also with chemoresistance of tumor cells. They promote chemoresistance by different mechanisms. Because we are going to study the mechanism of ATL-1 on chemosensitization, the examination of these genes can provide ideas for us. For example, SOX9 is a key transcription factor and related with chemoresistance; HMGB2 is known to bind to DNA structure resulting from cisplatin-DNA adducts and affect the chemosensitivity of cells; CD44 is related with stemness of cancer cells; S100A4 and CTGF are related with fibroblast in tumor microenvironment. We chose CTGF for further study because it might help us to explain the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 from aspect of microenvironment and CAF. The effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied. As ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. We wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation via CTGF in tumor microenvironment. As CTGF and CAF in tumor microenvironment have successfully explained the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 in the following experiments, we did not further examine other genes by RNA-seq at that moment.We found that the expression of CTGF in TNBC cells and fibroblasts could be reduced by ATL-1, which led to a decrease in cancer cell migration and an increase in chemosensitivity. Several studies have reported that CTGF can promote the migration of tumor cells, which supports our view. Our data also showed that CTGF expression was significantly higher in fibroblasts than in tumor cells ( Figures\u00a02D ,  4C ). This\u00a0also explains, to some extent, why ATL-1 treatment in co-culture systems could significantly increase chemotherapy sensitivity compared with treatment in single-culture systems of tumor cells. As for how the significant reduction of CTGF secretion level in fibroblasts affected the chemosensitivity of TNBC cells, we have the following two hypotheses. On the one hand, ATL-1 can directly affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy by reducing the secretion of CTGF by fibroblasts. CTGF has been reported to increase drug resistance to paclitaxel by upregulating survivin expression in human osteosarcoma cells. CTGF can promote chemoresistance in glioblastoma through TGF-\u03b21-dependent activation of Smad/ERK signaling. Even in vivo experiments have shown that CTGF antagonism with the mAb FG-3019 enhances the chemotherapy response in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, but to some extent that we think is more important, CTGF can promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs, and CAFs can promote chemotherapy resistance. ATL-1 can inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs induced by CTGF and indirectly increase the chemotherapy sensitivity of tumor cells in a co-culture system. CTGF can induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Tsang M et\u00a0al. found that CTGF is required for the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in a murine model of melanoma. As a downstream effector of the profibrotic molecule TGF-\u03b2, CTGF can promote the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts. All these observations support our findings.CTGF expression was reported to be controlled by TGFB1 signaling in fibroblasts and Hippo-YAP signaling in TNBC cells. In our results, we found that CTGF expression was reduced by ATL-1 in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. But the specific activated receptors and signaling pathways need to be further studied. RNA-seq, KEGG and GO analysis will be need for our further research.Our mice model showed that paclitaxel treatment and paclitaxel combined with ATL-1 treatment could reduce tumor volume and numbers of metastasis. Compared with single paclitaxel treatment, the addition of ATL-1 treatment could further enhance therapeutic effect. This was consistent with our results in vitro. But, we did not see any effect on single ATL-1 treatment on metastasis, though we saw ATL-1 treatment could inhibit TNBC cells migration via CTGF in the in-vitro model. Actually, metastasis is facilitated by at least four essential steps: detachment, migration, invasion and adhesion. These four essential, metastatic steps are inter-related and affected by multi-biochemical events and parameters. Just reducing the migration ability by ATL-1 may not be sufficient to reduce tumor metastasis in vivo models. Paclitaxel can cause the death of tumor cells by disrupting the normal microtubule dynamics required for cell division and vital interphase processes. Paclitaxel can significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and metastatic tumors and has been widely used in clinical practice. Although the reduction of CTGF and fibroblasts transformation induced by single ATL-1 treatment were not sufficient to inhibit tumor metastasis, these two steps played key roles in increasing the sensitivity of paclitaxel chemotherapy, and we have seen the enhanced therapeutic effect of the combination therapy in our in vivo models.In summary, our study demonstrated that ATL-1 could inhibit tumor cell migration via downregulation of CTGF in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, ATL-1 reduced the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts and inhibited fibroblast transformation into CAFs. ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. These results indicate that ATL-1 can increase chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and suppress breast cancer metastasis. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ATL-1.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material .

        "content": "Metastasis is the leading cause of breast cancer-related deaths. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant stromal cell type in the breast tumour microenvironment, may contribute to cancer progression through interaction with tumour cells. Nonetheless, little is known about the details of the underlying mechanism. Here we found that interaction of interleukin 32 (IL32) with integrin \u03b23 (encoded by ITGB3; a member of the integrin family) mediating the cross-talk between CAFs and breast cancer cells plays a crucial role in CAF-induced breast tumour invasiveness. IL32, an 'RGD' motif-containing cytokine, was found to be abundantly expressed in CAFs. Integrin \u03b23 turned out to be up-regulated in breast cancer cells during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). CAF-derived IL32 specifically bound to integrin \u03b23 through the RGD motif, thus activating intracellular downstream p38 MAPK signalling in breast cancer cells. This signalling increased the expression of EMT markers (fibronectin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) and promoted tumour cell invasion. Counteracting IL32 activity, a knockdown of IL32 or integrin \u03b23 led to specific inactivation of p38 MAPK signalling in tumour cells. Blockage of the p38 MAPK pathway also diminished IL32-induced expression of EMT markers and breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Thus, our data indicate that CAF-secreted IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin \u03b23-p38 MAPK signalling.",

CAFs can modulate drug response by different mechanisms including effects on tumour physiology which regulate tumour drug uptake or paracrine signalling altering cancer cell drug sensitivity 2, 3, 4. CAF\u2010derived markers, such as caveolin, stromal phospho\u2010Erk (pErk), and stroma\u2010derived gene signatures have been linked to sensitivity to chemotherapy and endocrine treatment 5, 6, 7.The PDGF family of growth factors, acting through PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase receptors, act as important regulators of CAFs 8, 9. Previous studies have demonstrated that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is linked to shorter survival in population\u2010based breast and prostate tumour collections 10, 11. Potential impact of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive fibroblasts on drug sensitivity is suggested by mechanistic studies, which have demonstrated that PDGFR\u2010signalling in fibroblasts can regulate treatment efficacy by controlling tumour drug uptake in a manner involving regulation of tumour interstitial fluid pressure 12, 13.Tamoxifen treatment represents a major component of clinical management of early breast cancer. Improved methods for identification of responsive patients remain a critical issue. Experimental and correlative studies have suggested a role for CAF\u2010derived markers as biomarkers for tamoxifen benefit 14, 15, 16.This study extends these earlier findings by analyses of the potential of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 as a tamoxifen\u2010sensitivity biomarker through analyses of two randomised study\u2010derived breast cancer collections.Material and methodsCohort 1Premenopausal patients with stage II (pT1pN1, pT2pN0, pT2pN1) primary breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009564) were randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, in the SBII:2 multicentre trial 17. Radiotherapy was delivered after breast conserving therapy and in patients with axillary lymph node metastases; chemotherapy and ovarian suppression was administered to <2% (nine patients). Median follow\u2010up time was 13.6 years for patients without any event. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks were retrieved from 500/564 patients and a tissue micro array (TMA) with two individual cores was constructed 17. Assessment of ER, PR and HER2 were performed according to clinical protocols 18. For ER\u2010 and PR\u2010status the clinically used cut\u2010point of more than 10% was used.Cohort 2The Stockholm tamoxifen trial included a cohort of 1780 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node negative disease and a tumour size not exceeding 30 mm, randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, irrespective of hormone receptor status. Radiotherapy was administered to patients receiving breast\u2010conserving therapy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given in this group of patients. The trial has previously been described in more detail 19. TMAs with three individual cores were constructed from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumours from 912 patients. The assessments of ER, PR and HER2 with immunohistochemistry have been previously described 20.ImmunohistochemistryPDGFR\u03b2 IHC for the pre\u2010menopausal TMA series was performed as described earlier 21. The post\u2010menopausal TMA series was immunohistochemically stained for PDGFR\u03b2 using the anti\u2010PDGFR\u03b2 antibody (#3169, 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) diluted in antibody diluent (Roche) in the Ventana system (Roche) with the Omnimap kit (5266548001, Roche). The secondary anti\u2010rabbit antibody was used according to manufacturer's instructions (5269679001, Roche). For antigen retrieval high pH buffer was used (T6455, Sigma Aldrich). After staining in the Ventana autostainer samples were dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95, 99%) and xylene and mounted using PERTEX (00871, Histolab). TMAs were then scanned at the tissue profiling facility at SciLifeLab, Uppsala University and pictures taken with the Aperio ImageScope software (v.11.2.0.780, Leica Biosystems). Final scores (0\u20133) were derived from two independent readings from JP and CS blinded to outcome data. In cases of dis\u2010concordance between readings (around 10%) slides were re\u2010visited for new consensus\u2010scoring. Cohort 1 was made with two cores/tumour, whereas cohort 2 was made up of three cores/tumour. Mean\u2010values for individual cores of each tumour were used for subsequent correlation and survival\u2010analyses.Statistical analysesThe association of PDGFR\u03b2 with other clinicopathological factors was evaluated using the \u03c72\u2010test. Time for follow\u2010up was defined as the time from randomisation until the first event, loco\u2010regional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to breast cancer. Survival curves and probabilities of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox hazard regression analysis.ResultsAssociations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological characteristics of early breast cancerTMAs from tumours of two different randomised studies on tamoxifen benefit in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal women 18, 19, was subjected to PDGFR\u03b2 IHC analyses and scored as previously described (Figure 1) 10, 11.Tumour stromal PDGFR\u03b2 immunohistochemical staining in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.

In this group, 65% of cases displayed high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression, whereas 42% of the post\u2010menopausal cases displayed high levels of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (Table 1).Clinico\u2010pathological characteristics and PDGFR\u03b2 status in the pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal cohortsPre\u2010menopausal patients stage II\tPost\u2010menopausal patients\t \t\t\tPDGFR\u03b2 n (%)\t\t\t\tPDGFR\u03b2 n (%)\t\t \tn\t<3+\t3+\tSignificance\tn\t<3+\t3+\tSignificance\t \tAll\t360\t127 (35)\t233 (65)\t\tAll\t528\t306 (58)\t222 (42)\t\t \tNode status\t\t\t\t\tNode status\t\t\t\t\t \tN0\t108\t34 (27)\t74 (32)\t\tN0\t528\t\t\t\t \tN+\t251\t93 (73)\t158 (68)\tp\u2009=\u20090.46\tN+\t0\t\t\t\t \tTumour size\t\t\t\t\tTumour size\t\t\t\t\t \t\u226420 mm\t128\t44 (35)\t84 (36)\t\t\u226420 mm\t385\t213 (71)\t172 (80)\t\t \t>20 mm\t231\t83 (65)\t148 (64)\tp\u2009=\u20090.77\t>20 mm\t132\t88 (29)\t44 (20)\tp\u2009=\u20090.023\t \tER status\t\t\t\t\tER status\t\t\t\t\t \tER+\t204\t72 (65)\t132 (70)\t\tER+\t393\t221 (74)\t172 (78)\t\t \tER\u2212\t97\t39 (35)\t58 (30)\tp\u2009=\u20090.41\tER\u2212\t127\t78 (26)\t49 (22)\tp\u2009=\u20090.31\t \tPgR status\t\t\t\t\tPgR status\t\t\t\t\t \tPgR+\t203\t67 (65)\t136 (71)\t\tPgR+\t236\t136 (49)\t100 (50)\t\t \tPgR\u2212\t241\t36 (35)\t56 (29)\tp\u2009=\u20090.49\tPgR\u2212\t241\t140 (51)\t101 (50)\tp\u2009=\u20090.92\t \tHER2 status\t\t\t\t\tHER2 status\t\t\t\t\t \tHER2\u2212\t226\t77 (82)\t149 (85)\t\tHER2\u2212\t420\t245 (87)\t175 (85)\t\t \tHER2+\t43\t17 (18)\t26 (15)\tp\u2009=\u20090.49\tHER2+\t69\t38 (13)\t31 (15)\tp\u2009=\u20090.61\t \tIn the post\u2010menopausal cohort a significant association (p\u2009=\u20090.023) was detected between high PDGFR\u03b2 expression and small tumour size (Table 1). No significant association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological features were detected in the pre\u2010menopausal group.Impact of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression on RFS in tamoxifen\u2010treated ER+ breast cancerA set of analyses, restricted to ER+ cases, were performed which compared treatment effects in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal subsets defined by stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status.As shown in Figure 2A, a significant benefit of tamoxifen treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.026), measured by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses of RFS, was detected in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group. Strikingly, this significant treatment benefit was not seen in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group. This differential effect of tamoxifen in the two marker\u2010defined patient sub\u2010groups was also seen in Cox regression analyses where treatment was associated with a significant HR in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group (HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)), but not in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group (HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)).(A) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with more than 10% expression of ER in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort. (B) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (0.23\u20130.73)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (0.31\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with >75% expression of ER in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.Initial analyses of the complete post\u2010menopausal cohort yielded results with a trend of reduced tamoxifen benefit in the subset with high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (data not shown). Based on findings from earlier meta\u2010analyses that tamoxifen benefit is most prominent in cases with high ER expression novel analyses were performed on the subset of the post\u2010menopausal cohort with more than 75% ER\u2010positive cells (290 cases out of 393). Interestingly, analyses of this sub\u2010group yielded results similar to those seen in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort with significant tamoxifen\u2010benefit, determined both by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses and Cox hazard regression analyses, detected in the PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate group (HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (95% CI 0.23\u20130.73)), but not in the PDGFR\u03b2 high group (HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (95% CI 0.31\u20131.42)) (Figure 2B).Together these analyses thus indicate that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is a marker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen.DiscussionIn contrast to the majority of studies analysing factors associated with benefit of tamoxifen this study describes previously un\u2010recognised associations between a tumour stroma marker and tamoxifen benefit.Support for the notion that stromal fibroblasts can impact on efficacy of drugs targeting malignant cells, have been presented from analyses of series of cases not derived from randomised studies 6, 7. The earlier analyses of the pre\u2010menopausal cohort of the present study which identified pERK as a marker associated with tamoxifen efficacy, is to our knowledge the only other study which have demonstrated associations between a fibroblast\u2010marker and treatment efficacy based on analyses of randomised studies 5. The present findings thus represent a significant addition in the efforts to translate and consolidate pre\u2010clinical findings by analyses of well\u2010annotated clinical samples.The present study identifies associations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit. Earlier studies have shown that stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status is largely independent from stroma abundance in general or stromal \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positivity 10, 22. These findings therefore suggest that the detected association is not related to stroma abundance but rather reflects more specific biology of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells.This study does not address if the detected association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit reflects a direct involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 signalling in tamoxifen effects, or rather is related to other signalling effects of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells. Concerning the former, findings from model studies have demonstrated effects of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 on tumour drug uptake 13, 23, 24. Paracrine signalling from fibroblasts have also been shown to directly affect drug efficacy 2, 25, 26. Previous experiments have indeed demonstrated tamoxifen\u2010protective effects by co\u2010cultured fibroblasts in tissue culture models 14, 15, 16. According to preliminary studies this effect is not related to PDGFR\u03b2 status of fibroblasts, since also fibroblast with down\u2010regulation of PDGFR\u03b2 displayed a protective effect (data not shown). The clinical associations therefore appear more likely to be related to PDGFR\u03b2\u2010controlled drug exposure. Future studies could explore this possibility be measuring tamoxifen uptake, or ER activity, in tumour samples with known stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status from tamoxifen treated cases.Both cohorts represent randomised clinical trials with long time of follow\u2010up, of importance as patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer frequently experience late relapses. With few exceptions the patients received no other systemic treatment than tamoxifen. A limitation is that the study is retrospective and at the time when the trials were implemented less women than today had breast conserving surgery. Type of surgery had however no influence on the results (data not shown).Based on the results from the present study it seems highly appropriate to integrate fibroblast\u2010related markers, in general, and PDGFR\u03b2, specifically, in future prospective efforts to identify tamoxifen\u2010benefit biomarkers.Author contributionsAll authors provided substantial contributions, were involved in preparation of the manuscript and approved the final version Janna Paulsson: data collection, data analyses, manuscript writing; Lisa Ryd\u00e9n: conception of study, data analyses, manuscript writing; Carina Strell: data collection, data analyses; Oliver Frings: data analyses; Nicholas P.

        "content": "Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed on the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) of the tumor stroma. Recently, we reported the preclinical evaluation and clinical biokinetics of a novel <sup99m</supTc-labeled FAP inhibitor radioligand ([<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP). This research aimed to evaluate [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity. [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP was prepared from freeze-dried kits with a radiochemical purity of 98 \u00b1 1%. The study included thirty-two patients diagnosed with glioma (<in</i = 5); adrenal cortex neuroendocrine tumor (<in</i = 1); and breast (<in</i = 21), lung (<in</i = 2), colorectal (<in</i = 1) and cervical (<in</i = 3) cancer. Patients with glioma had been evaluated with a previous cranial MRI scan and the rest of the patients had been involved in a [<sup18</supF]FDG PET/CT study. All oncological diagnoses were corroborated histopathologically. The patients underwent SPECT/CT brain imaging (glioma) or thoracoabdominal imaging 1 h after [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP administration (i.v., 735 \u00b1 63 MBq). The total lesions (<in</i = 111) were divided into three categories: primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III-IV gliomas and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma. Both [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP and [<sup18</supF]FDG detected 26 (100%) PT, although the number of positive LNm and Dm was significantly higher with [<sup18</supF]FDG [82 (96%)], in comparison to [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP imaging (35 (41%)). Peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in a patient with recurrent colorectal cancer were only visualized with [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP. In patients with breast cancer, a significant positive correlation was demonstrated among [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP uptake values (Bq/cm<sup3</sup) of PT and the molecular subtype, being higher for subtypes HER2+ and Luminal B HER2-enriched. Four different CAF subpopulations have previously been described for LNm of breast cancer (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1, which is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2 and triple-negative), confirming that FAP+ is a marker for poor disease prognosis.

Recently, we reported the preclinical evaluation and clinical biokinetics of a novel 99mTc-labeled FAP inhibitor radioligand ([99mTc]Tc-iFAP). This research aimed to evaluate [99mTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP was prepared from freeze-dried kits with a radiochemical purity of 98 \u00b1 1%. The study included thirty-two patients diagnosed with glioma (n = 5); adrenal cortex neuroendocrine tumor (n = 1); and breast (n = 21), lung (n = 2), colorectal (n = 1) and cervical (n = 3) cancer. Patients with glioma had been evaluated with a previous cranial MRI scan and the rest of the patients had been involved in a [18F]FDG PET/CT study. All oncological diagnoses were corroborated histopathologically. The patients underwent SPECT/CT brain imaging (glioma) or thoracoabdominal imaging 1 h after [99mTc]Tc-iFAP administration (i.v., 735 \u00b1 63 MBq). The total lesions (n = 111) were divided into three categories: primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma. Both [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG detected 26 (100%) PT, although the number of positive LNm and Dm was significantly higher with [18F]FDG [82 (96%)], in comparison to [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging (35 (41%)). Peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in a patient with recurrent colorectal cancer were only visualized with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. In patients with breast cancer, a significant positive correlation was demonstrated among [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake values (Bq/cm3) of PT and the molecular subtype, being higher for subtypes HER2+ and Luminal B HER2-enriched. Four different CAF subpopulations have previously been described for LNm of breast cancer (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1, which is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2 and triple-negative), confirming that FAP+ is a marker for poor disease prognosis. The results of this pilot clinical research show that [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT imaging is a promising tool in the prognostic assessment of some solid tumors, particularly breast cancer.1. IntroductionTumors are pathological complexes composed of tumor cells and the tumor stroma or tumor microenvironment (TME), which consists of cellular and acellular components, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), macrophages, blood vessels, pericytes, and extracellular matrices (ECM). In fact, CAFs induce a cancer phenotype and are responsible for the production of proteolytic enzymes, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components. CAFs contribute up to 90% of the macroscopic tumor mass, provide mechanical support to tumor cells and control their survival, metastasis, proliferation, and resistance to therapies. CAFs can have different origins, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, resident tissue fibroblasts and epithelial/endothelial cells, and adipocytes and pericytes that transdifferentiate to mesenchymal cells; therefore, they represent a heterogeneous cell population within the TME.Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a membrane-anchored peptidase expressed by CAFs at the stromal level of various tumor entities and contributes to progression and a worse prognosis. FAP degrades denatured collagens and participates in tumor growth via a non-enzymatic mechanism.Diagnostic FAP inhibitor radiotracers under clinical evaluation use 18F and 68Ga linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine and cyclo-[benzene(trimethanethiol-DOTA)-Met-Pro-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Met] (FAPI-2286) structures, which are radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography), and only one work has reported 99mTc, also linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine for SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging. Internationally, the amount of equipment available for molecular imaging studies is predominantly higher for gamma cameras (SPECT modality), and they represent more than 70% of the total. For SPECT images, the most-employed radionuclide is 99mTc. Therefore, the need for target-specific radiopharmaceuticals labeled with 99mTc is increasing within the field of oncology. Our group previously reported [99mTc]Tc-((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl) boronic acid ([99mTc]Tc-iFAP) as a new SPECT radioligand capable of specifically detecting FAP expressed by CAFs located in the cancer stroma and, to our knowledge, the first ligand based on 99mTc-labeled boron-Pro derivatives. Furthermore, the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP biokinetic\u2013dosimetric evaluation in healthy volunteers and three cancer patients diagnosed with breast, lung, and cervical cancer showed favorable biokinetics and uptake in primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases, achieving high-quality and high-contrast molecular images.This research aimed to evaluate [99mTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity.2. ResultsNo adverse events related to the diagnostic use of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP were observed. Table 1 shows the general characteristics of patients included in the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging evaluation. A detailed cancer staging of patients is shown in Table A1 (Appendix A). Patient imaging results were categorized into two groups. Patients with gliomas (n = 5), with which SPECT and SPECT/MR images were acquired, were identified as the first group. The second group involves all cases (n = 27) of breast, lung, colon, NET, renal cortex, and cervical cancer, in which SPECT/CT and PET/CT images were obtained.[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas (T/Bc range 6.3\u201313.9) (Table 2) and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma (Figure 1). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging resolution and contrast were good enough for the high-grade glioma, which could allow the performing of non-invasive diagnoses to differentiate between low- and high-grade gliomas based on their distinct FAP expression. For all cancer cases, a total of 111 lesions were evaluated, which were classified as primary tumors (PT)(n = 26), lymph node metastases (LNm) (n = 61), and distant metastases (Dm) (n = 24) (Table 3). All primary tumors were detected with both [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and [18F]FDG PET/CT (Figure 2 and Figure 3), which did not occur with LNm and Dm lesions (Figure 4 and Figure 5). That is, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT detected PT (100%), LNm (51%), and Dm (17%) in contrast to [18F]FDG PET/CT, which detected PT (100%), LNm (100%), and Dm (88%) (Table 3). The non-detection of LNm and Dm with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP could be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), including those not detected in NT and lung cancer, but not in 39% of the lesions with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Additionally, none of the Dm lesions detected by [18F]FDG in patients with triple negative and luminal B HER2+ molecular subtypes at the bone, liver, and lung exhibited [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake.These results are expected since FAP expression decreases once the cells succeed to invade. FAP is a protein that promotes metastasis; therefore, once the micrometastasis is established in a distant site from the PT, it loses its FAP expression. The signaling mediated by FAP/integrins/PI3K has a negative effect on IGF2 expression (associated with increased glucose uptake). This fact probably explains why as FAP uptake in Dm decreases, FDG uptake increases. As a unique feature of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP images, a very low background was achieved as previously reported (Figure 3). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake was considerably lower regarding [18F]FDG in patients with cervical cancer and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the adrenal cortex, which agrees with their relatively low FAP expression in comparison to lung and breast cancer (Figure 2). In general, the Dm lesions detected with [18F]FDG did not show [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, except for peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in recurrent colorectal cancer, which only showed [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, but not [18F]FDG uptake (Figure 5). CAFs are abundant in mesothelial metastases, and, through the mesothelial-mesenchymal transformation mechanism, it is likely that in carcinomatosis there is a greater transdifferentiation of mesenchymal cells towards CAFs FAP+.When comparing the values obtained from the average tumor-to-background ratios of the different background sites [T/Bm (tumor/mediastinum), T/Bl (tumor/liver) and T/Bp (tumor/psoas muscle)] for all lesions, the highest values were T/Bp for both imaging methods (Figure 6). Although no statistically significant difference was found, the values of the T/Bp ratios were higher with [18F]FDG than with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (Figure 6). In the T/B data, the same trend is observed in terms of a higher uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the primary tumors compared to that obtained in the lymph node and distant metastases (Figure 6).In the case of breast cancer, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP showed a significant positive correlation between the T/Bp value of the primary tumors and the molecular subtype (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.8085), where HER2+ and Luminal B HER2+ enriched subtypes showed the highest T/Bp ratios (Figure 7). The [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake in HER2+ could be associated to the Erb2-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr654 of \u03b2-catenin, which promotes the activation of Wnt signaling pathways and the consequent promotion of the tumor invasive capacity (FAP expression) through a very common mechanism in breast cancer, the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, induced by the microenvironment, which infers the gain of invasive capacity and the arrest of the cell cycle, while, at the signaling level, it implies the repression of E-cadherin expression through snail/slug. In LN metastases, a decrease in T/Bp ratio was observed and there was no significant correlation among the molecular subtypes (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.4027) (Figure 7). 3. DiscussionThe expression of FAP is an indication that the cell is expressing an invasive phenotype associated with an intense process of differentiation, typical of the first stages of carcinogenesis. During this phase, there is an intense activation of signaling pathways aimed at promoting the differentiation of cell precursors towards the activated fibroblast phenotype. As the tumor evolves, the stroma changes genetically and epigenetically to generate the appropriate niche for its stage. Cellular plasticity allows cells to adapt to their microenvironment through reprogramming processes (phenotypic and genotypic modifications) for tumor progression. RNAs produce epigenetic modifications that alter transcription, activating stem cell transformation and EMT processes (including FAP expression), which are essential for invasion to occur. FAP is overexpressed by CAFs from various tumor entities, making it a promising biomarker and target for many medical interventions. CAF subpopulations (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4) are classified depending on the expression of six markers: integrin b1/CD29, \u03b1-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), PDGFR-\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), CAV1 (caveolin 1), and S100-A4/FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1 (CAF-S1 FAP+).In their study, Kratochwil et al. demonstrated the elevated and selective uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-04 in the stroma of multiple tumors, including breast, lung, colorectal, and NET cancer. However, this research demonstrated the tumor stroma imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP as the first SPECT radioligand based on a boron-Pro derivative.The results showed that the detection of primary tumor lesions with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is consistent when compared with [18F]FDG. However, when detecting LNm and Dm, the superiority of [18F]FDG is clear. This fact can be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), but not in 39% of the tumors with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Thus, our findings are discussed from the perspective of tumor stroma heterogeneity in lesions with enough size to be detected by SPECT. As mentioned, the dynamics of differentiation in the tumor microenvironment are attributed to genetic and non-genetic changes in tumor cells, the composition of the extracellular matrix, cell\u2013cell interactions, and cell heterogeneity. Based on this, it is likely that the increased uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP by primary tumors due to the presence of increased amounts of CAF-S1 FAP+ indicates an active EMT process, which is known to happen in the early phases of carcinogenesis, through which the dissemination of cells from the primary mass to distant sites is promoted. EMT involves the regulation of both intercellular adhesions by decreasing E-cadherin and increasing N-cadherin, as well as substrate adhesions through integrin mediated primarily by TGF-B, \u03b2-catenin, and the Wnt signaling pathway.On the other hand, hypoxic and hypoglycemic tumor stroma synergistically promotes the EMT phenotype in carcinomas. Thus, tumors where GLUT1 expression is commonly increased will also have an inability to express an (invasive) EMT phenotype. Accordingly, it is likely that the lack of uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in LNm and Dm is related to the fact that in this type of lesion there is an increase in the expression of GLUT1 receptors that leads to an increase in glucose metabolism, which produces a rise in the uptake of [18F]FDG and, at the same time, inhibits EMT (including FAP expression). The neoplasm with the largest number of patients in this study was breast cancer, which showed a significant positive correlation in PT between the T/Bp value and the molecular subtypes, with the highest T/Bp ratios for the HER2+ and Luminal B subtypes HER2+. The T/Bp values in HER2+ breast cancer showed a significant decrease in the LN metastases regarding PT (Figure 7), which may be due to crosstalking (cross-regulation), which occurs between integrins and EGFR receptors, such as HER2. Additionally, it is known that the Wnt signaling pathway promotes the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells in a HER2-dependent manner. It was recently confirmed that the expression of HER2 in the cell membrane is heterogeneous and that the accumulation of HER2 occurs in regions where adhesion to the extracellular matrix is dynamic. Therefore, HER2 expression decreases in regions where focal adhesions are concentrated, and the relative local decrease in HER2 expression in LNm, compared to PT, is probably related to the metastatic process. As a relevant point, it is noted that the presence of CAFs in the tumor stroma of breast cancer is associated with resistance to immunotherapy, since the elements secreted by CAFs derived from HER2+ tumors regulate resistance to treatment in a paracrine way. Thus, the decrease in [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake by LNm could indicate greater sensitivity to trastuzumab treatment.Highly-relevant data have been reported on axillary LNm in breast cancer: (1) the stroma represents around 25\u201330% of the invaded areas (regardless of subtype); (2) the predominant CAF subpopulations are CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (the latter being the most abundant); (3) CAFs enrichments are different in LNm compared to PT; (4) the secretion of CXCL12\u03b2 by CAF-S1 and the expression of CXCR4 in cancer cells is involved in the initiation of EMT and in the distant metastatic process, particularly in lung and bone; and (5) the global stromal content in LNm provides a prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients and, therefore, the CAF-S1/CAF-S4 abundance status exhibits a prognostic value, since both present pro-invasive properties with different modes of action; however, CAF-S4 is known to have a greater impact on distant metastatic spread (Dm), particularly on the liver.CAF-S1 FAP+ promotes an immunosuppressive environment by secreting CXCL12\u03b2, promoting the presence of CD4+CD25+ T cells, increasing T cell survival, and promoting the cell differentiation into CD25+FOXP3+ cells. The ability of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to inhibit the proliferation of effector T cells is also enhanced by CAF-S1. CAF-S4 is highly contractile and induces cancer cell invasion in three dimensions through Notch signaling. CAF-S1 FAP+ is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2+ and triple negative), confirming that FAP+ is a poor prognostic marker.Summarizing, the relatively low performance of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in detecting LNm and Dm may be related to the molecular biology of cancer and the proportion of the enrichment of CAF-S1 FAP+, which is not the most abundant in metastatic lesions (LN or distant) (Figure 8). Even when the FAP expression is associated with a phenotype that tends to transmigration and proliferation, attention must be placed on the fact that its expression is temporary and that it depends largely on the tumor microenvironment dynamics; thus, when the characteristics of the tumor stroma are modified, FAP expression and cancer prognosis can change.Our results differ from the work of K\u00f6mek et al., where they showed that PET/CT [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 is superior to [18F]FDG in the detection of primary mammary lesions and metastases (ganglionic and visceral) in twenty patients with breast cancer, both in primary and recurrent lesions, although the average size of the evaluated LNm was 10 mm. On the other hand, Backhaus et al. evaluated the use of PET/MRI with the ligand [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT in 19 women with breast cancer with evidence of high uptake in the primary lesions (mean diameter of 26 mm) and LNm (average diameter of 21 mm). Our results probably vary from the previous research carried out due to the heterogeneity of the sample with respect to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer, the image acquisition time, and the different image acquisition method (SPECT/CT vs. PET/CT vs. PET/MRI). The dynamic behavior of FAP is firmly associated with its functions in the progression phase during cancer evolution (tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, the promotion of tumor proliferation, and immunomodulation), which deserves to be used as a tool for the detection of the heterogeneity of the tumor stroma in the different stages of cancer through molecular imaging with specific radiotracers, such as [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. Therefore, additional clinical studies must be performed, including the results of the ex vivo FAP expression in tumors (immunohistochemical evaluation) to be correlated with the uptake of FAP inhibitory radiotracers. Today, CAFs is receiving considerable attention in the field of cancer biology. Targeted CAF therapy can potentially inhibit metastasis and cancer progression by reducing immunosuppression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic targeting of FAP has been described in different modalities, such as vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and nanoparticles. In preclinical studies, CAF-S1 FAP+ has shown to cause resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and reduce antitumor immunity. CAFs from breast, ovarian, lung, pancreas, and colon cancer have shown expression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2; particularly the CAF-S1 FAP+ subset. Additionally, the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation is an important source of CXCL12 secretion, which plays a crucial role in resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer.Taking into account the deleterious effect of metastases on the survival of breast cancer patients, our data could heighten the interest in evaluating the abundance of the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation, in vivo, in a non-invasive manner, by means of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT in axillary LNm during the initial clinical approach (staging) to determine the prognosis and the benefit of therapies, such as anti-FAP, anti-TGF\u03b2, anti-CXCR4, and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, in combination with standard therapies (Figure 8). More prospective research is needed to enrich the information obtained so far and we believe that future research can be focused on the function of FAP ligands in different molecular and histological subtypes of breast cancer, as well as their potential in detecting relapse of the disease, in the evaluation of the response to therapy and the prognosis of the patient.Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a complication of various malignant tumors and is generally associated with a poor prognosis. The superiority of uptake by [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in peritoneal carcinomatosis, due to recurrent colon cancer observed in the patient included in this study, agrees with the findings previously described, demonstrating a greater sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 for the detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with various types of cancer.The findings observed in patients with glioma coincide with the data previously reported by R\u00f6hrich et al., where they showed little or no uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 in low-grade WHO II gliomas and high uptake in gliomas of high WHO III-IV grade, regardless of HDI status; therefore, its usefulness could lie mainly in the differentiation of tumor recurrence versus post-treatment changes and in surgical and/or radiotherapy planning, for which more prospective studies are needed in this regard.4. Materials and Methods4.1. ReagentsAn iFAP (boron-Pro ligand) lyophilized kit for 99mTc labeling was obtained from the National Institute of Nuclear Research (ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico) with GMP certification. [99mTc]TcO4Na was eluted from a generator (99Mo/99mTc GETEC, ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico). Other reagents were received from Millipore Co. (Burlington, MA, USA). 4.2. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP PreparationAfter the reconstitution of the iFAP lyophilized kit with a [99mTc]TcO4Na/0.2 M phosphate buffer (1:1 v/v, 2 mL, 740 MBq) solution and incubation in a block heater (92 \u00b0C, 15 min), the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP radioligand was obtained with a radiochemical purity (R.P.) greater than 98% (HPLC, Discovery C18 column, 5 \u00b5m particle size, I.D. of 0.46 cm, length of 25 cm; Supelco, Millipore, Burling-ton, MA, USA; coupled to a UV\u2013Vis detector and a radiometric detector), applying the following linear gradient: a flow rate of 1 mL/min, 0.1% TFA/water (A) (from 100 to 50%, over 10 min, maintained for 10 min, 30% over 5 min, and returned to 100% over 5 min) and 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile (B). As previously reported, the lyophilized formulation contains the HYNIC-iFAP (((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)boronic) ligand with a specific alignment to the corresponding regions of the FAP binding site, stannous chloride as a reducing agent, as well as ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) to complete the coordination sphere of the [Tc(V)]HYNIC core (Figure 9).The chemical characterization of the iFAP ligand included analysis by mass spectrometry (UPLC-mass), 1H\u2013NMR, UV\u2013Vis and FT-IR. Radiochemical characterization included reversed-phase radio-HPLC and ITLC-SG (instant thin layer chromatography-silica gel) with the following mobile phases: 2-butanone, 0.1 M sodium citrate, and ammonium acetate-methanol (1:1 v/v), as reported in detail previously.4.3. PatientsThirty-two patients (mean \u00b1 SD age, 50.8 \u00b1 16.7 years; 28 women and 4 men) with different types of cancer (breast cancer (n = 21), lung cancer (n = 2), adrenal cortex NETs (n = 1), colorectal cancer (n = 1), cervical cancer (n = 3) and gliomas (n = 5)) were included.The patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 (n = 5 gliomas) and Group 2 (n = 27 breast, lung, colon, renal cortex NET, and cervical cancer). The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 and with a detailed clinical description in Appendix A (Table A1). All oncological diagnoses were determined histopathologically (Table 2).The patients underwent SPECT/CT 1\u20133 h (with an average of 2 h) after the intravenous application of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5MBq). In Group 1, only of the brain region, and in Group 2, the thoracoabdominal region. The tumor/background ratio is optimal for diagnostic images from 30 min post-injection. However, it was decided 2 h after radiotracer administration to improve the contrast of the images (lesions vs. background). The acquisition protocol and the post-injection waiting time were the same for all types of cancer evaluated. However, in patients with cervical cancer or pelvic etiology, immediate image acquisition was performed post-micturition to reduce the artifact of radiotracer accumulation in the urine.All patients in Group 1 had previous cranial MRI (6 \u00b1 1 days interval) and patients in Group 2 had previous [18F]FDG PET/CT studies carried out (11 \u00b1 12.6 days interval).This research was performed in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the National Cancer Institute (INCan), Mexico. The patients signed an informed consent declaration, and the protocol was approved by the institutional Nuclear Medicine Ethics Committee. 4.4. Image Acquisition[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT images were acquired with a dual-head gamma camera (SPECT/CT, Symbia TruePoint, Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA), with low-energy, high-resolution collimators; parameters: window at 140 keV, matrix size of 128 \u00d7 128, with dispersion correction, 90 images of 8 s, rotation of 360 degrees. For the attenuation correction map, the low-dose CT parameters were obtained. A Butterworth filter (cutoff: 0.5, 5th order) and an iterative method (8 iterations /4 subsets) were used for the reconstruction of the raw data.SPECT/CT images were acquired 2 h after the intravenous administration of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5 MBq). The anatomical region studied in Group 1 was only the brain and in Group 2 it was thoracoabdominal. Activity in regions of interest was quantified, via 3D imaging, as Bq/cm3.All patients in Group 2 had undergone a prior PET/CT (Excel 20) scan (Siemens Medical Solutions), performed at 1 h after [18F]FDG administration (CT: slice thickness of 5 mm, 180 mAs and 120 kVp). Whole-body scans were obtained in 3D mode from the vertex to mid-thighs (2\u20133 min per bed position). PET images were reconstructed using a two-dimensional expectation algorithm of ordered subsets.4.5. Image AnalysisImages obtained with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG were examined on a Siemens VG60 multimodal workstation. Visual and semi-quantitative analyses were performed by two physicians with more than 9 years of experience in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging (workstation with processing software for volumetric analysis).Visual analysis was performed on both groups of patients. Uptake was compared with the morphology of the corresponding lesion using CT and/or MRI, depending on the patient group. The detected lesions were divided into three categories for study: primary tumor (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). The semiquantitative analysis of lesion uptake was obtained by calculating the tumor-to-background ratio (T/B) with spherical volumes of interest (VOIs) to homogenize the data obtained with both radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, in Group 2, the concordance of uptake between both radiotracers was compared by quantifying the number of lesions (PT, LNm, and Dm).4.6. Tumor Tissue SamplesAll patients underwent a biopsy of the primary tumor lesion. Histopathology was used to determine the existence of viable tumor tissue and to verify the diagnosis. The histopathological reports were interpreted by a certified and experienced pathologist.4.7. Statistical AnalysisThe Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the T/Bp [99mTc]Tc-iFAP values and the molecular subtypes of the patients with breast cancer; a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.5. ConclusionsThe results of this pilot study show that SPECT imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is a promising and potentially useful tool in the evaluation of the tumor microenvironment of multiple solid neoplastic entities. Within the different types of cancer that we included, we observed a potential panorama in the prognostic evaluation of recently diagnosed breast cancer, as well as its probable diagnostic superiority in peritoneal carcinomatosis in recurrent colon cancer. [18F]FDG was superior to [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the detection of LNm and Dm. However, with the analyses carried out, we can establish that the role of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is not to displace metabolic molecular imaging, but rather that it serves as a complement for an adequate prognostic evaluation.Further prospective [99mTc]Tc-iFAP clinical studies are needed to define the clinical impact of the non-invasive in vivo detection of FAP in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and its implication in determining candidates for immunotherapy and target therapy combined with conventional therapies.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization, G.F.-F., P.V.-A., E.A.-V. and M.L.-G.; methodology, P.V.-A., M.L.-G., P.C.-T. and B.S.-B.; formal analysis, P.V.-A., C.S.-C., G.F.-F., F.O.G.-P., B.O.-G. and E.A.-V.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.V.-A. and G.F.-F.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.F.-F.; funding acquisition, M.L.-G. and C.S.-C.

Four CAF subpopulations have been reported in the lymph node metastases of breast cancer (CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The most relevant and predominant are CAF-S1 FAP+ and CAF-S4 FAP-. Pelon et al. established a model of clinical application to the knowledge generated from the different subpopulations, in such a way that a prognostic impact is proposed according to the predominance of CAFs as follows: if at the time of diagnosis the patient exhibits low content of CAF-S1 FAP+ in LNm, they present a low risk of late Dm ((a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-), no uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal A breast cancer); on the other hand, if high levels of CAF-S1 FAP+ are demonstrated in LNm, the risk of distant metastasis increases ((b) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(+), uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal B HER2+ breast cancer). Finally, in distant metastatic lesions, only CAF-S4 FAP- is expressed [(c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-) in lung Dm and extremely low uptake in some right axillary lymph nodes that exhibit hypermetabolism with [18F]FDG; likewise, (d) multiple lung and liver metastases did not exhibit uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP].

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

Immunohistochemistry staining of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), Ki-67, podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), S100A4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), PDGFR\u03b2, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2) was performed on tissue microarray consisting of 642 breast cancer cases. Samples were categorized into luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) according to immunohistochemical results, whereas tumor stroma was classified into desmoplastic, sclerotic, normal-like, or inflammatory type based on histological findings. Expression of CAF-related proteins in the stroma differed depending on breast cancer molecular subtypes. All CAF-related protein expression was high (p &lt; 0.05) in HER-2 type, whereas in luminal A, the expression of FAP\u03b1, PDGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2, and NG2 was low, and in TNBC, the expression of podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and S100A4 was low. In the stromal component, CAF-related protein expression differed according to stromal phenotype (p &lt; 0.001). The desmoplastic type showed high expression of podoplanin, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, S100A4, PDGFR\u03b1, and PDGFR\u03b2, whereas the sclerotic type exhibited low expression of FAP\u03b1, PDGF\u03b1, PDGF\u03b2, and NG2. The inflammatory type had high expression of FAP\u03b1 and NG2 with low podoplanin, while normal-like type showed low expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and S100A4. Our results suggested that differential CAF-related protein expression depended on the molecular subtypes and stromal histologic features of breast cancer, indicating that in the future, this system could potentially use these markers for prognosis prediction and targeted therapy of breast cancer.",

The results suggest that the fibrosis and environmental cytokines contribute to the collective invasion of cancers in vivo. INTRODUCTIONTumor invasion is one of the most critical steps in cancer metastasis. However, the mechanism of cancer cell invasion into the connective tissues has not sufficiently been elucidated. For understanding this mechanism, it is essential to clarify the interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironmental factors. 1 ,  2  In addition, simple and physiologically relevant experimental models are required for these studies. Fibroblasts are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment. There are many lines of evidence that fibroblasts around cancer cells, called cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promote tumor invasion and progression by complex interaction with cancer cells. 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6  Cytokines such as transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2), epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1), regulate the epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT), motility, and proliferation of cancer cells, depending on cancer cell types. 5 ,  7 ,  8  Extracellular matrix\u2010degrading enzymes such as MMPs and serine proteinases are also required for cancer cell invasion. 4 ,  5 ,  9  Extracellular matrices such as fibronectin (FN) 10 ,  11 ,  12  and laminins 13 ,  14 ,  15  play fundamental roles in supporting adhesion, survival, and migration of cancer cells. Fibronectin is the major ECM component produced by normal fibroblasts and CAFs. 10 ,  11  There is accumulating evidence that FN is involved in tumor progression, and its tumor\u2010suppressive functions have also been reported. 11 ,  12  Recent in vitro studies have shown that the FN matrix supports cancer cell invasion. 16 ,  17 ,  18  However, some other studies suggest that CAFs support cancer cell invasion by direct interaction with cancer cells. 19 ,  20 ,  21  One of the studies indicated that fibroblasts lead collective cell invasion of epidermoid carcinoma cells in collagen matrix. 21  In this model, fibroblasts tow cancer cells into the collagen matrix by direct cell adhesion through E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin heterophilic interaction.Recently we established a simple 3\u2010D collagen gel culture model to investigate the cancer invasion mechanism. Using this system, we proposed a novel tumor invasion mechanism in which cancer cells invade the collagen matrix while binding to fibroblasts through integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21/FN interaction. 22  In this mechanism, invasive cancer cells, such as lung carcinoma A549 and pancreatic carcinoma Panc\u20101 cells, individually migrate on single elongated protrusions of CAFs on which FN fibrils are densely assembled. However, it seems physically difficult for a cluster of cancer cells to migrate on a single fibroblast fiber. Pathological studies of cancer tissues showed that the migration of cancer cells in clusters, ie collective cancer invasion, occurs more often than the single cell invasion. 23 ,  24 ,  25  In the former cases, cancer cells collectively invade stromal tissues keeping tight intercellular junctions, mostly the E\u2010cadherin\u2010mediated junction. 25  In this study, therefore, we investigated whether our previously proposed mechanism is applicable to collective cancer invasion. We also examined the effects of some cytokines on cancer cell invasion in our model.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsFunction\u2010blocking mouse mAbs against FN (FN12\u20108) and E\u2010cadherin (SHE78\u20107) were purchased from Takara. Other Abs used were described previously. 22  Cytokines and signaling inhibitors were purchased as follows: EGF, TNF\u2010\u03b1, SB431542 (TGF\u2010\u03b2 type I receptor/ALK5 inhibitor), Y27632 (Rock inhibitor), LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), and U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) were from Fuji Film/Wako, and TAPI\u20101 (metalloproteinase inhibitor) was from Funakoshi. The RGD peptide (Gly\u2010Arg\u2010Gly\u2010Asp\u2010Ser\u2010Pro) was purchased from Takara and bovine dermis native collagen from Koken.Human cell lines, colorectal cancer tissues, and culture conditionDLD\u20101 (colon adenocarcinoma) and MCF\u20107 (mammary adenocarcinoma) cells were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research and Bioresources. Green fluorescent protein\u2010labeled Panc\u20101 (pancreas adenocarcinoma), GFP\u2010labeled A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), and WI\u201038 (fetal lung fibroblast) cell lines were used in our previous study. 22  DLD\u20101 cells were labeled with GFP by introducing the pTagGFP2\u2010N vector (Evrogen) with the Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen), and the GFP\u2010expressing cells were selected with Geneticin (Gibco). MCF\u20107 cells were transiently labeled with green fluorescence using Cell Explore Live Cell Tracking Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (AAT Bioquest). Primary cultures of human lung cancer\u2010derived fibroblasts were established in Juntendo University Hospital. The Institutional Review Board at the Juntendo University School of Medicine approved the procedures. The patient provided written, informed consent (No. 20\u00a0042). Experimental procedures were carried out according to the institutional guidelines and those of the 1995 Declaration of Helsinki. In this study, one of the fibroblast lines was used as a CAF. In some experiments, CAFs were transiently labeled with red fluorescence using the same kit as above. All these cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Human cancer specimens were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the Kanagawa Cancer Center (KCC) Hospital (Kanagawa, Japan) between 2006 and 2009 and provided by Human Cancer Tissue Bank of KCC. 22  The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committees of KCC, and carried out as described previously. 22  Cancer cell invasion assay in 3\u2010D collagen gelCollagen gel invasion assay was undertaken as previously reported. 22  Briefly, hybrid spheroids of cancer cells and CAFs were prepared by incubating their mixture (1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well each) overnight on an EZSPHERE 96\u2010well plate (AGC Techno Glass), which effectively prepares homogeneous microspheroids. 26  The resulting spheroids in each well were collected into a 1.5\u2010mL tube and suspended in 100\u00a0\u00b5L ice\u2010cold collagen/medium solution. Each spheroid contained approximately 170 cells on average for each cell type. For the 3\u2010D gel cultures, two layers of collagen gel, ie 70\u00a0\u00b5L lower gel and 50\u00a0\u00b5L upper spheroid\u2010containing gel, were prepared on the 12\u2010mm glass bottom of 35\u2010mm culture dishes (AGC) and incubated in the standard medium for 2\u201014\u00a0days. Phase\u2010contrast images with GFP fluorescence signals were obtained using an Olympus CKX41 inverted microscope. For time\u2010lapse experiments, phase\u2010contrast images with fluorescent signals were obtained using a Keyence BZ\u20109000 digital fluorescence microscope equipped with a CO2 incubator at 60\u2010minute intervals for one representative spheroid.Inhibition assays of 3\u2010D cancer cell invasionTo assay inhibitory activity of Abs, 10\u00a0\u00b5g/mL normal mouse IgG as control, 1.3\u00a0\u00b5g/mL anti\u2010FN mouse mAb (FN12\u20108), 1.3\u00a0\u00b5g/mL anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin SHE78\u20107 mouse mAb, or antiintegrin Abs at a 100\u2010fold dilution were included in both spheroid\u2010containing gel and culture medium. To see the effects of small molecules and cytokines, the factors were added only into culture medium. The RGD peptide was used at 0.3\u00a0mmol/L. Fluorescent images were obtained after 2\u00a0days of incubation. Relative activity of DLD\u20101 cell invasion was quantitated by NIH ImageJ software. One broader area enclosing invaded and noninvaded cells and a spheroid core area were separately set in each fluorescent image of 12\u201015 representative spheroids obtained from triplicate dishes. The tumor cell invasion was determined by subtracting the fluorescent intensity of the spheroid core from that of the broader area.Cell adhesion assays in 2\u2010D culturesAdhesion activity was assayed on 24\u2010well culture plates. Fluorescence\u2010labeled cancer cells were seeded at 2 \u00d7 104 cells/well on a previously prepared confluent CAF layer. To assay inhibitory activity of Abs, cancer cells were pretreated with each Ab at a concentration described above for 30\u00a0minutes and then placed on the CAF layer together with each inhibitor sample. In the case of anti\u2010FN Ab, CAFs were pretreated with the Ab. After incubation for 5\u00a0hours, culture images were taken under a fluorescent microscope and the percentage of spread cancer cells was determined in each image with similar cell distribution.ImmunocytochemistryImmunofluorescent staining was undertaken as described previously. 22  Cultures or frozen tissue sections were fixed with 10% formalin, blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA/PBS. They were treated with the anti\u2010FN mouse mAb FN12\u20108 or the anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin mouse mAb SHE78\u20107 at \u00d7100 dilution at 4\u00b0C overnight and then with the second Ab conjugated with Cy3 (red) or Alexa Fluor 488 (green) at room temperature for 2\u00a0hours. After each treatment, the cultures were extensively washed with PBS. For double immunofluorescent staining, the anti\u2010FN mouse mAb was prelabeled with FITC and applied to the E\u2010cadherin\u2010 or integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21\u2010stained samples. Fluorescent images were obtained under the Carl Zeiss 710 laser scanning microscope with ZEN software.Small interfering RNAs and transfectionGene suppression (knockdown) of integrin \u03b15 in DLD\u20101 cells and FN in CAFs was carried out using pools of four siRNAs and a negative control RNA (Dharmacon SMARTpool; GE Healthcare) as described previously. 22  Two or three days after the transfection, these cells were used to determine the knockdown effects. The downregulation of the targets was confirmed by immunoblotting.Sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting analysis (western blotting)Confluent cultures in 6\u2010cm culture dishes were washed with PBS and dissolved in 0.5\u00a0mL lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X\u2010100. The SDS\u2010PAGE was carried out on Bio\u2010Rad Mini\u2010Protean gels (4%\u201015%). Ten microliters of the SDS\u2010treated cell lysates was applied on each lane. Immunoblotting was undertaken by the standard procedure, and the separated antigens were visualized by the ECL method.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was evaluated with an unpaired, two\u2010tailed Student\u2019s t test. A P value of less than .05 was considered significant. Unless otherwise noted, all statistical data shown are the means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD with indicated n values.RESULTSSingle cell invasion and signal inhibitorsTo compare with the collective invasion, single cell invasion was carried out using GFP\u2010labeled A549 lung cancer cells. When the A549 cells were incubated alone on the low cell attachment microfabricated EZSPHERE plate overnight, they formed cell aggregates or loose spheroids (pure spheroids) (Figure\u00a01A), but they produced solid spheroids when mixed with CAFs (Figure\u00a01B). When the A549/CAF hybrid spheroids were placed into collagen gel, the cancer cells individually migrated on extremely elongated protrusions of CAFs. The fastest cancer cells migrated on the CAF protrusions at speed over 200\u00a0\u00b5m/d (approximately 250\u00a0\u00b5m/d in Figure\u00a01C). When the loose aggregates of A549 cells were placed alone into collagen gel, they very slowly invaded the matrix (below 50\u00a0\u00b5m/d) (Figure\u00a01D).Spheroid formation and single cell invasion in 3\u2010D collagen gel of A549 cells.

Scale lines, 100\u00a0\u00b5mUsing this tumor invasion model, we examined the effects of some signal inhibitors on invasion of Panc\u20101 pancreatic cancer cells (Figures\u00a02 and S1). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited the cell invasion, whereas the TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling inhibitor SB431542 and the Rock inhibitor Y27632 promoted it. The MEK inhibitor U0126 appeared to have a weak inhibitory activity, but the activity of the metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI\u20101 was unclear. The proinvasive activity of SB431542 was also found for A549 cells in our previous study with a different coculture model. 27  These data indicated that this tumor invasion model can be used for surveying various inhibitors and activators.Effects of signaling inhibitors on collagen gel invasion of Panc\u20101 cells. Hybrid spheroids of Panc\u20101 and WI\u201038 cells were incubated for 2\u00a0d with 2\u00a0\u00b5mol/L U0126, 5\u00a0\u00b5mol/L LY294002, 10\u00a0\u00b5mol/L\u00a0mmol/L SB431542, 10\u00a0\u00b5mol/L Y27632, or 2\u00a0\u00b5mol/L TAPI\u20101 in the culture medium.

B, Representative images from each group. Scale line, 100\u00a0\u00b5mCollective invasion of colon cancer cellsWe next attempted to establish a collective cancer invasion model using similar hybrid spheroids. This study used two adenocarcinoma cell lines, DLD\u20101 (colon cancer) and MCF\u20107 (mammary cancer). DLD\u20101 cells were stably labeled with GFP, whereas MCF\u20107 cells were stained with FITC dye before use. Western blotting analysis showed that both cell lines expressed high levels of E\u2010cadherin (Figure\u00a03A, left panels). Integrin\u2010\u03b15 was expressed at a lower level in MCF\u20107 cells than DLD\u20101 cells (Figure\u00a03A, right panels). When incubated alone on the low cell attachment microplates, both cell lines formed solid spheroids as compared with A549 cells, suggesting the E\u2010cadherin\u2010mediated tight cell junction (Figure\u00a03B,C, upper panels, also see Figure\u00a01A). The two cell lines also formed solid spheroids with CAFs (Figure\u00a03B,C, lower panels). When CAFs were labeled with a red fluorescent dye, the resultant hybrid spheroids showed that CAFs were mostly localized in the spheroid core in DLD\u20101/CAF and MCF7/CAF spheroids, whereas they appeared even in the spheroid surface in A549/CAF spheroids (Figure\u00a0S2). Like DLD\u20101 and MCF\u20107, squamous cell carcinoma lines expressing E\u2010cadherin, such as A431, VMRC, and CaSki, formed hard pure spheroids due to their tight intercellular junction, whereas three poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cell lines did not form solid spheroids (Figure\u00a0S3).Expression of E\u2010cadherin (E\u2010Cad) and integrin\u2010\u03b15 (Itg\u2010\u03b15) in DLD\u20101 and MCF\u20107 cells and their spheroid formation. A, Immunoblots for E\u2010Cad (left panels) and Itg\u2010\u03b15 (right panels). GAPDH, internal loading control. Protein loaded per lane: 10\u00a0\u00b5g for E\u2010Cad and 30\u00a0\u00b5g for Itg\u2010\u03b15. B, C, Phase\u2010contrast images (left) and fluorescent images (right) of pure spheroids (upper panels) and hybrid spheroids (lower panels) of DLD\u20101 (green) (B) and MCF\u20107 (green) cells (C). Scale lines, 50\u00a0\u00b5mThe pure spheroids of DLD\u20101 or hybrid spheroids of DLD\u20101 with CAFs were embedded into collagen gel (Figures\u00a04 and S4). In the case of the hybrid spheroids, DLD\u20101 cells collectively invaded the matrix but very poorly and slowly (Figure\u00a04A). Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts also poorly migrated from the spheroids. The poor migration of CAFs was thought to result from their localization in the spheroid core (Figures\u00a03B and S2B). This was contrasted with the case of A549/CAF spheroids (Figures\u00a01B and S2A). We tested the effects of some cytokines and signal inhibitors. The TGF\u2010\u03b2 inhibitor SB431542 clearly promoted the invasion of both DLD\u20101 cells and CAFs (Figures\u00a04B and S4B,F), whereas Y27632, which promoted single cell invasion (Figure\u00a02A,B), did not show the proinvasive effect on DLD\u20101 cells (Figure\u00a0S4C,G). Like SB431542, EGF and TNF\u2010\u03b1 individually stimulated the invasive activity of both cancer cells and CAFs (Figure\u00a04C,D). SB431542 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 appeared to synergistically promote the cancer cell invasion (Figure\u00a04E). As EGF and TNF\u2010\u03b1 are known to induce EMT or stimulate cell motility, 8 ,  28 ,  29  they were supposed to loosen the cell\u2010cell interaction of DLD\u20101 cells, allowing CAFs to migrate from the spheroid core. Indeed, some DLD\u20101 cells migrated as single cells at invasion fronts in the presence of EGF or TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Figure\u00a04C,E, yellow arrows). In any case, the collective invasion of DLD\u20101 cells was associated with elongated CAF protrusions (CAF fibers) (Figure\u00a04A,B,D,E, white arrows). Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 is a well\u2010known EMT inducer. Although TGF\u2010\u03b2 appeared to loosen the intercellular junction of DLD\u20101 cells, it strongly inhibited the collagen invasion of both CAFs and DLD\u20101 cells (Figure\u00a04G). Judging from the spheroid outgrowth, SB431542, EGF, nor TNF\u2010\u03b1 seemed to have significant growth effect on DLD\u20101 cells, at least during the 7\u00a0days of incubation.Collective invasion of DLD\u20101 cells (green) from hybrid spheroids with cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and its influential factors.

Note adhesive pseudopodia in the magnified inset (left panel)We also examined the effect of the anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin Ab on DLD\u20101 cell invasion. This Ab, which blocked the cell\u2010cell interaction in 2\u2010D cultures, rather promoted the CAF\u2010dependent matrix invasion of DLD\u20101 cells even in the absence of SB431542 (Figures\u00a04F and S4D). The single cell migration on fibroblast protrusions was enhanced by the Ab more evidently than EGF or TNF\u2010\u03b1 (Figure\u00a04F, yellow arrows). This indicated that the E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin interaction is not important for the DLD\u20101 invasion in our experimental model. 21  However, DLD\u20101 cells could not migrate from their pure spheroids (Figure\u00a0S4H).When SB431542 and Y27632 were applied to the pure spheroids of CAFs, the former supported the migration of CAFs with larger protrusions than control cells, whereas the latter promoted rapid migration of CAFs with fine and short protrusions (Figure\u00a0S5). Unlike the case of the single cell invasion, the size and strength of Y27632\u2010stimulated CAF protrusions seemed insufficient for supporting the clusters of DLD\u20101 cells (Figures\u00a02, S4,and S5).Interaction between cancer cells and CAFs during collective cell invasionAs shown in Figure\u00a04, the collective invasion of DLD\u20101 cells was found along with elongated CAF protrusions. The migration of multicellular clusters was rarely found on single fibroblast protrusions. In addition, we often observed the migration of single cells or small cell clusters at invasion fronts (Figure\u00a05A, yellow arrows). This caused the separation of the leader cells from the follower cell clusters.Double immunofluorescent (IF) staining for fibronectin (FN) and E\u2010cadherin (E\u2010Cad) of collagen gel culture of DLD\u20101/cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF) spheroids.

Note bundle structures of CAF fibers and intense staining for FN. C, Double IF staining for E\u2010cadherin (red) and FN (green). The boxed field is magnified in the right panel. Scale lines, 100\u00a0\u00b5mThe requirement of stable or mechanically strong CAF fibers for collective invasion was also illustrated by a time\u2010lapse experiment (Figure\u00a04H, Video S1). Cancer cells collectively and slowly migrated, searching for stable CAF fibers. Detachment from CAFs terminated their collective invasion. In this experiment, the migration speed was calculated to be approximately 44\u00a0\u00b5m/d. This is far slower than the speed of A549 cell migration (250\u00a0\u00b5m/d), as shown in Figure\u00a01C.Immunostaining for FN more clearly showed that migrating DLD\u20101 cells adhered to assembled structures of multiple CAF fibers, named bundle structures, which were densely stained for FN (red) (Figure\u00a05A,B). In addition, immunostaining of E\u2010cadherin showed that the majority of cancer cells collectively migrated on the CAF fibers, keeping E\u2010cadherin\u2010mediated intercellular junctions (Figure\u00a05C). These data suggested that DLD\u20101 cells adhered to CAF fibers through interaction with FN assembled on the surface of CAFs, as reported in the single cell invasion. 22  Association of invading cancer cells with FN\u2010rich CAF fibers was further examined in 2\u2010D cocultures by double immunofluorescent staining. When DLD\u20101 cells were placed on a confluent CAF monolayer, they formed E\u2010cadherin\u2010linked cell clusters along with marked FN fibrils (Figure\u00a06A). Peripheral cancer cells in the cell clusters and singly migrating cancer cells showed strong signals for integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21, which were often colocalized with FN fibrils (Figure\u00a06B,C). The possible integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21/FN interaction was also suggested in the immunohistochemistry of human colon adenocarcinoma tissue. Consistent with the 2\u2010D cultures, invasive E\u2010cadherin\u2010linked cancer cell clusters were found in stroma with abundant FN fibrils (Figure\u00a06D). Cancer cells at invasion fronts, which contacted with FN fibrils, showed stronger signals for integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 than those of inner cancer cells (Figure\u00a06E,F). Similar collective invasion was found in all of the 10 colorectal cancers examined. These data supported the possible mechanism that colon cancer cells bind to CAFs through integrin/FN interaction.Collective invasion of colon cancer cells in contact with fibronectin (FN) fibrils in 2\u2010D cultures (A\u2010C) and human cancer (D\u2010F): double immunofluorescent (IF) staining for FN (green) and E\u2010cadherin (E\u2010Cad, red) or integrin (Itg)\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 (red).

D\u2010F, Two close sections of a colon cancer specimen were subjected to double IF staining as indicated. The boxed field in (E) is magnified in (F). Arrows indicate contact sites with FN fibrils. Note that cancer cells at invasion fronts show stronger signals for Itg\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 (E, F). Scale lines, 10\u00a0\u00b5m (A\u2010D, F) and 20\u00a0\u00b5m (E)To verify the molecular mechanism, the DLD\u20101/CAF interaction was investigated by using function\u2010blocking Abs in 2\u2010D cultures. DLD\u20101 cells rapidly adhered to the confluent CAF layer and spread in spindle shapes (Figure\u00a0S6A). This adhesion was strongly inhibited by Abs against integrin\u2010\u03b15, \u2010\u03b15\u03b21, \u2010\u03b21, and FN and by RGD peptide (Figures\u00a07A and S7A). Anti\u2010integrin\u2010\u03b1v and anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin Abs significantly but very weakly inhibited the cell adhesion. These results indicated that DLD\u20101 cells bound to CAFs mainly through the interaction between integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 on DLD\u20101 cells and FN on CAFs. The integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21/FN interaction was also verified in the 3\u2010D invasion assay with DLD\u20101 cells (Figures\u00a07B and S7B). The Abs against integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 and FN, as well as the RGD peptide, significantly blocked the DLD\u20101 invasion in the collagen matrix. Similar to the effects of the function\u2010blocking Abs, knockdown of the integrin\u2010\u03b15 gene in DLD\u20101 cells or the FN gene in CAFs clearly inhibited the adhesion of DLD\u20101 cells to CAFs (Figures\u00a07C and S8). In addition, the two kinds of gene knockdown appeared to inhibit the CAF\u2010dependent collagen gel invasion of DLD\u20101 cells (Figure\u00a07D).Inhibitory effects of function\u2010blocking Abs (A, B) and gene suppression (C, D) on 2\u2010D adhesion to cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (A, C) and on 3\u2010D collagen gel invasion (B, D) of DLD\u20101 cells.

D, Representative images from each group (eight spheroids)Collective invasion of MCF\u20107 mammary carcinoma cellsCancer\u2010associated fibroblast\u2010dependent collective invasion was also examined with MCF\u20107 cells. When the hybrid spheroids of MCF\u20107 with CAFs were embedded into collagen gel, CAFs migrated from the spheroids, supporting the collective migration of MCF\u20107 cells (Figures\u00a08A and S9A). Therefore, the proinvasive effect of SB431542, if any, was not evident. Unlike DLD\u20101 cells, some MCF\u20107 cells migrated individually (Figures\u00a08A,C and S9A, yellow arrows). This might be related to the lower expression of integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 and the lower adhesive activity to CAFs in this cell line as compared with DLD\u20101 cells (Figures\u00a03A, right panel, and S6B). Epidermal growth factor further promoted the single cell invasion along with CAF fibers, probably inducing EMT or stimulating cell motility. The collective invasion of MCF\u20107 cells was always supported by bundles of multiple CAF fibers. This is shown more clearly by a time\u2010lapse experiment (Video S2) and immunostaining for E\u2010cadherin and FN (Figure\u00a08E,F). The immunostaining showed that MCF\u20107 cells with E\u2010cadherin junction migrated on bundles of CAF fibers, forming cell clusters. It is noted that larger bundles of CAF fibers supported the migration of larger clusters of cancer cells. Although EGF promoted single cell invasion, the cancer cells bound to large CAF fibers maintained or reproduced tight cell\u2010cell junctions (Figure\u00a0S9E, white arrow).Collective invasion of MCF\u20107 cells (green) in collagen gel (A\u2010D) and double immunofluorescent (IF) staining for fibronectin (FN, green) and E\u2010cadherin (E\u2010Cad, red) (E\u2010F). A\u2010D, MCF\u20107/cancer\u2010associated fibroblast spheroids were incubated for 3\u00a0d without (A) or with 10\u00a0ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) (B), 10\u00a0mmol/L SB431542 (C), or SB431542\u00a0+\u00a0EGF (D).

The boxed field in (E) is magnified in (F). Scale line, 100\u00a0\u00b5mDISCUSSIONCollective invasion is the major mode of cancer metastasis. 23 ,  24 ,  25 ,  30  This type of invasion is usually observed in E\u2010cadherin\u2010positive epithelial cancers, with some exceptions. 23 ,  25  In this study we tested if this invasion mode can be explained by our previously proposed mechanism for single cell invasion. 22  Our results indicated again that cancer cells invaded the collagen matrix by directly binding to FN fibrils assembled on CAFs. As reported previously, 22  CAFs extended their protrusions to form fiber structures in collagen gel, and FN fibrils were densely accumulated on their surface. The FN fibrils assembled on CAF fibers seemed to be the most preferable substrate for cancer cells in the 3\u2010D collagen matrix. This mechanism seems common to both the single\u2010cell and the collective invasion modes. Integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 is known to be a major receptor for FN.10,11 Our previous and present studies suggest that integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 plays a major role in the binding of cancer cells to the FN fibrils on CAFs, but other types of FN receptors, including integrin\u2010\u03b1v\u03b23, might be important, depending on cell types. Important differences between the two invasion modes were the E\u2010cadherin\u2010based cell\u2010cell connection and the density of CAF fibers supporting the migration of the cancer cell clusters. Both DLD\u20101 and MCF\u20107 cells formed E\u2010cadherin\u2010linked cell clusters, and their collective migration in collagen gel required assembly of multiple CAF fibers (bundle structure) as the stable substrate, although A549 cells individually migrated on single CAF fibers. This seems reasonable when the mechanical capacity of CAFs to hold large multicellular clusters is considered. Conversely, these cancer cells appeared to integrate multiple CAF fibers to form their bundle structures, probably by the strong cell\u2010cell connection.The collective invasion is thought to be controlled by the coordinated interplay between cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010ECM interactions. 24  The leader cells at the invasion front acquire a mechanical traction force to pull the follower cell cluster by adhering to suitable substrates. Recent studies with 3\u2010D collagen cultures have shown that CAFs play important roles in leading collective cancer cell migration. 19 ,  21  One group reported that CAFs lead collective migration of A431 cells by directly binding to the cancer cells through the E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin junction. 21  Consistent with their and our previous findings, the present study showed the importance of the direct cancer cell\u2010CAF interaction in collective cancer invasion. In our models, however, DLD\u20101 cells adhered to CAFs, at least mainly, through integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21/FN interaction. The anti\u2010E\u2010cadherin Ab stimulated the CAF\u2010dependent DLD\u20101 cell invasion, especially their single cell invasion. This is inconsistent with the E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin junction model, 21  but agreed with a recent study that reported that genetic deletion of E\u2010cadherin enhances the invasive activity of ductal carcinoma cells in vitro but reduces tumor growth and metastasis in mice. 31  However, our results do not exclude the possibility that the E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin interaction might be involved in the DLD\u20101/CAF interaction under some specific steps.The present study showed that the speed of collective invasion was far lower than the single cell invasion in the spheroidal invasion experiments. The E\u2010cadherin junction is obviously an impediment for cell migration. How do such cancer cells efficiently metastasize in vivo? Many mechanisms have been proposed for this question. 24 ,  32 ,  33  In these mechanisms, cancer cells transiently, reversibly, or partially undergo EMT during the process of distant metastasis. 32 ,  33 ,  34 ,  35  Such epithelial plasticity was also found in the present study. We found that EGF, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and the TGF\u2010\u03b2 inhibitor SB431542 promoted the collective invasion of DLD\u20101 cells. Both EGF and TNF\u2010\u03b1, which often induce EMT, 8 ,  28 ,  29  enhanced cancer cell migration, possibly by dissociating or loosening their E\u2010cadherin junctions and by enhancing cell motility. It is likely that these and other cytokines in the microenvironment would transiently enhance cell migration by breaking the cell\u2010cell junction during their collective invasion in vivo. After enhanced migration, they would reconstruct tight cell\u2010cell junctions as the cell number increases on the stable CAF substrate. Compared with the two cytokines, the effect of SB431542 was somewhat strange because TGF\u2010\u03b2 is an EMT inducer. However, little is known about the activity of TGF\u2010\u03b2 in 3\u2010D conditions. Although TGF\u2010\u03b2 appeared to loosen the intercellular junction of DLD\u20101 cells, it strongly inhibited the collagen invasion of both CAFs and DLD\u20101 cells. We previously found that SB431542 stimulates HGF expression in fibroblasts and tumor cell invasion in collagen gel. 27  Hepatocyte growth factor promotes migration of normal and cancer cells in 2\u2010D and 3\u2010D conditions, and its expression is negatively regulated by TGF\u2010\u03b2. 36 ,  37  Therefore, SB431542 seemed to enhance the cancer cell invasion by stimulating the outgrowth of CAFs in our 3\u2010D invasion model. Transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 is known to have both tumor\u2010suppressive and proinvasive effects depending on tumor stages and experimental conditions. 2 ,  3  Obviously, extensive and careful studies are needed to elucidate the clinical significance of TGF\u2010\u03b2 inhibitors.It is also noted that in our 3\u2010D invasion models and 2\u2010D cocultures, cancer cells bound to CAF fibers showed elongated shapes and sometimes migrated alone (Figures\u00a05A, 8Ac, S6A,B, and S9A,C). The integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21\u2010mediated adhesion to fibrillary FN facilitates cancer cell invasion by activating FAK, Erk, Akt, and other signal mediators, hence remodeling the cytoskeleton. 22 ,  38 ,  39 ,  40  Thus, the leader cancer cells could gain a traction force to pull the follower cancer cells by FN/integrin signaling. It seems possible that small clusters of such leader cells are separated from the follower cell clusters and seeded into circulation. Such tumor cell clusters in circulation are thought to cause distant metastasis much more efficiently than singly circulating cells. 41 ,  42  Our results are consistent with previous reports showing the importance of integrin expression in tumor prognosis. 43 ,  44  In conclusion, we could recapitulate the collective invasion of colon and breast cancer cell lines in a simple 3\u2010D collagen coculture model with CAFs. The cancer cells collectively migrated through the collagen matrix while binding to bundles of CAF fibers through the integrin\u2010\u03b15\u03b21 and FN interaction. These results reinforce the ideas that fibrosis, altered ECM, and local cytokines contribute to tumor progression. 32 ,  45  Many types of 3\u2010D experimental models for cancer studies have been reported so far. 46  Our experimental model uses two major components in the tumor microenvironment, fibroblasts and collagen, as well as their products. Our invasion assay is simple and rapid and suitable for investigating various interactions between cancer cells and CAFs. This method can be used for investigating the complex mechanisms of cancer invasion as well as for drug screening.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors do not have any financial support or relationship that may pose conflict of interest.Supporting informationREFERENCESThe microenvironment of the tumour\u2010host interfaceThe tumour microenvironment as a target for chemopreventionStromal fibroblasts in cancer initiation and progressionStromal myofibroblasts are drivers of invasive cancer growthThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerMolecular requirements for epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition during tumor progressionHeterotypic signaling between epithelial tumor cells and fibroblasts in carcinoma formationTumor necrosis factor\u2010alpha stimulates the epithelial\u2010to\u2010 mesenchymal transition of human colonic organoidsMatrix metalloproteinases: regulators of the tumor microenvironmentFibronectin fibrillogenesis, a cell\u2010mediated matrix assembly processFibronectin: How its aberrant expression in tumors may improve therapeutic targetingFibronectin in Cancer: Friend or FoeLaminin\u20105: Unique biological activity and role in tumor growth and invasionLaminin 332 in squamous\u2010cell carcinomaHighly sensitive detection of invasive lung cancer cells by novel antibody against amino\u2010terminal domain of laminin gamma2 chainFibronectin\u2010guided migration of carcinoma collectivesCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts lead tumor invasion through integrin\u2010\u03b23\u2010dependent fibronectin assemblyCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts promote directional cancer cell migration by aligning fibronectinFibroblast\u2010led collective invasion of carcinoma cells with differing roles for RhoGTPases in leading and following cellsDirect cancer\u2010stromal interaction increases fibroblast proliferation and enhances invasive properties of scirrhous\u2010type gastric carcinoma cellsA mechanically active heterotypic E\u2010cadherin/N\u2010cadherin adhesion enables fibroblasts to drive cancer cell invasionCancer cell migration on elongate protrusions of fibroblasts in collagen matrixCancer cell invasion and EMT marker expression: a three\u2010dimensional study of the human cancer\u2010host interfaceIlluminating breast cancer invasion: diverse roles for cell\u2013cell interactionsCollective invasion in ductal and lobular breast cancer associates with distant metastasisMicrofabric vessels for embryoid body formation and rapid differentiation of pluripotent stem cellsInhibition of transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 signaling potentiates tumor cell invasion into collagen matrix induced by fibroblast\u2010derived hepatocyte growth factorExpression of laminin gamma2 chain monomer enhances invasive growth of human carcinoma cells in vivoEpithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition stimulates human cancer cells to extend microtubule\u2010based invasive protrusions and suppresses cell growth in collagen gelAn emerging tumor invasion mechanism about the collective cell migrationE\u2010cadherin is required for metastasis in multiple models of breast cancerCancer invasion and the microenvironment: plasticity and reciprocityContext\u2010dependent EMT programs in cancer metastasisMetastatic progression is associated with dynamic changes in the local microenvironmentStromal fibroblasts induce metastatic tumor cell clusters via epithelial\u2013mesenchymal plasticityNegative regulation of hepatocyte growth factor gene expression in human lung fibroblasts and leukemic cells by transforming growth factor\u2010beta1 and glucocorticoidsTransforming growth factor\u2010beta signaling\u2010deficient fibroblasts enhance hepatocyte growth factor signaling in mammary carcinoma cells to promote scattering and invasionIntegrin \u03b15\u03b21 facilitates cancer cell invasion through enhanced contractile forces\u03b15\u03b21\u2010Integrin promotes tension\u2010dependent mammary epithelial cell invasion by engaging the fibronectin synergy siteLeader cells regulate collective cell migration via Rac activation in the downstream signaling of integrin \u03b21 and PI3KCirculating tumor cell clusters oligoclonal precursors of breast cancer metastasisA collective route to metastasis: Seeding by tumor cell clustersIncreased beta1 integrin is associated with decreased survival in invasive breast cancerIntegrin expression profiling identifies integrin alpha5 and beta1 as prognostic factors in early stage non\u2010small cell lung cancerTumor\u2010stromal crosstalk in pancreatic cancer and tissue fibrosisEngineering cancer microenvironments for in vitro 3\u2010D tumor models"

        "content": "Multiple juxtacrine and paracrine interactions occur between cancer cells and non-cancer cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that direct tumor progression. Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) are an integral component of the TME, and the majority of breast tumor stroma is comprised of CAFs. Heterotypic interactions between cancer cells and non-cancer cells of the TME occur via soluble agents, including cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and secreted microRNAs. We previously identified a microRNA signature indicative of hyperactive MAPK signaling (hMAPK-miRNA signature) that significantly associated with reduced recurrence-free and overall survival. Here we report that the hMAPK-miRNA signature associates with a high metric of stromal cell infiltrate, and we investigate the role of microRNAs, particularly hMAPK-microRNAs, secreted by CAFs on estrogen receptor (ER) expression in breast cancer cells. ER-positive MCF-7/ltE2- cells were treated with conditioned media (CM) from CAFs derived from breast cancers of different PAM50 subtypes (CAFBAS, CAFHER2, and CAFLA). CAF CM isolated specifically from ER-negative primary breast tumors led to ER repression in vitro. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of CAF-secreted exosomes in CM and the uptake of these exosomes by the ER+ MCF-7/ltE2- cells. Differentially expressed microRNAs in CAF CM as well as in MCF-7/ltE2- cells treated with this CM were identified. Knockdown of miR-221/222 in CAFBAS resulted in knockdown of miR221/222 levels in the conditioned media and the CM from CAFBAS; miR221/222 knockdown rescued ER repression in ER-positive cell lines treated with CAFBAS-CM. Collectively, our results demonstrate that CAF-secreted microRNAs are directly involved in ER-repression, and may contribute to the MAPK-induced ER repression in breast cancer cells.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play an important role in the initiation, metastasis, and invasion of breast cancer. However, whether autophagy acts as a tumor promotion mechanism by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is still controversial and remains undefined at the mechanistic levels. In this study, we investigated whether autophagy or FAP-\u03b1 is required for the invasion, pulmonary metastasis and EMT of breast cancer cells and underlying mechanism. We employed an in vitro model of NIH3T3 fibroblasts treated with H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub and confirmed that TGF-\u03b21 could convert fibroblasts into CAFs through autophagy under oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Modulation of autophagy by rapamycin, 3-methyladenine or ATG-5 knockdown regulated the expression of CAFs markers, suggesting a role of autophagy in the tumor promotion mechanism of TGF-\u03b21-induced CAFs activation. Furthermore, we established an indirect co-culture model and a mixed xenograft as a corresponding in vivo model. We demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs promote tumor invasion, pulmonary metastasis and EMT, which act through autophagy and overexpression of FAP-\u03b1 in both models, while autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocked these effects induced by TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs. Moreover, the co-localization of LC3\u03b2 and EMT marker vimentin in mixed xenograft also revealed that TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs promote tumor growth, pulmonary metastasis, and EMT program partly through autophagy. In addition, knockdown of FAP-\u03b1 resulted in reversed EMT and abolished tumor invasion and pulmonary metastasis induced by TGF-\u03b21-activated CAFs. Taken together, we conclude that both autophagy and FAP-\u03b1 are required for breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Targeting autophagy or FAP-\u03b1 rather than both can serve as a potential approach to improve the prognosis for human breast cancer.",

It has been shown that ECM plays a crucial role in the tumor progression, mediates invasion, intra- and extravasation of the tumor cells, and can impact anti-tumor immune response and the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy. ECM in the tumor microenvironment can be assessed by different modalities: bulk and cell-specific gene arrays can demonstrate early changes in ECM-related genes (Col I, \u03b1SMA, LOX, etc.), providing mechanistical insights; while measurement of accumulated proteins (collagen, fibronectin, laminin and etc.) can delineate temporal tumor-host interactions; physical properties of ECM, such as elasticity and stiffness, allows for measurement of ECM mechanical function that shown to contribute to tumor aggressiveness. Fibroblasts play a key role in the formation and remodeling of ECM structures in TME. In addition to this well-defined function, in recent years it was recognized that fibroblasts contribution to TME is more complex and dynamic with evidences for both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive actions. These actions are mediated both by cell-cell contacts as well as by secreted factors.Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2) family members, including TGF\u03b2, activin/inhibin and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) participate in a wide variety of biological processes under normal and pathological conditions. Proteins of the TGF\u03b2 family are primarily morphogens and play a crucial role in the embryonic development and adult tissue regeneration and homeostasis. Dysregulation, such as mutations in the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway, is frequently associates with cancer. TGF\u03b2 broad biological effects include regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, apoptosis, immune cell functions, ECM remodeling, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The action of TGF\u03b2 is context dependent, which makes the interpretation of its biological effects difficult and requires consideration of microenvironmental factors such as cell type, developmental stage and interaction with other signaling cascades. Indeed, at the early stages of carcinogenesis, TGF\u03b2 signaling in epithelial cells is tumor suppressive, at later stages, however, it promotes the invasion and metastasis of neoplastic cells. In myeloid cells, a lack of TGF\u03b2 signaling decreases tumor size and the number of metastases, whereas in fibroblasts, decreased TGF\u03b2 signaling correlates with poor prognosis in cancer patients. While TGF\u03b2 demonstrates a strong impact on the main functions of fibroblasts, including proliferation, cytokine secretion, cytoskeletal structure rearrangement and ECM deposition and remodeling, its actions on fibroblasts within complex and dynamic tumor microenvironment, where it can crosstalk with other signaling pathways, still not fully dissected.Previously, our group has shown that TGF\u03b2 signaling on myeloid cells regulates expression and activity of CD73 (Ecto-5\u2032-nucleotidase) and affects tumor progression. CD73 is a membrane protein that, downstream of CD39 (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1), forms a molecular tandem hydrolyzing extracellular ATP and ADP into adenosine. ATP/ADP and adenosine are potent modulators of cell functions, acting in auto- and paracrine manner. Adenosine has been implicated in many pathological processes and is one of the hallmarks of tissue hypoxia, including in cancer. Adenosine exhibits pro-tumorigenic effects in the microenvironment through four types of membrane receptors: A1, A2a, A2b and A3. In our recent work we have suggested a novel adenosinergic mechanism of regulation of TGF\u03b2 actions in the tumor microenvironment evident by the existence of cell-specific molecular loops: the TGF\u03b2/CD73 axis on myeloid cells and the adenosine/TGF\u03b2 axis on fibroblasts. Decreased expression of CD73+ on myeloid cells in the tumor tissue of MMTV-PyMT mice correlated with increased collagen deposition and resulted in decreased tumor growth and metastasis. We found that adenosine was able to decrease TGF\u03b2-induced phosphorylation of Smad proteins in fibroblasts via A2a/A2b receptors. This work is in line with several studies that have previously demonstrated that TGF\u03b2 signaling can be regulated by cAMP-related pathways. Based on our findings, we have suggested that adenosine, generated in the tumor microenvironment by myeloid cells, can shape TGF\u03b2-depended effects of fibroblasts that contribute to the tumor growth and metastasis.To elucidate how adenosine influences TGF\u03b2-dependent fibroblasts functions during cancer progression, we have conducted experiments with mouse mammary fibroblasts and human fibroblast cell lines and have measured their proliferation, as well as secretory, migratory, and contractile fibroblast functions. Moreover, in co-culture experiments, we have confirmed that myeloid cells can affect functions of mammary fibroblasts through adenosine signaling.Materials and methodsGenetically modified miceAnimal studies were approved by Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (IACUC M1600128-01).

Secondary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (Promega, USA) were used in 1:30000 dilution for 2 hours at room temperature. Protein bands were detected with ECL reagent (Thermo Scientific, USA) on ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad, USA). Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH).Analysis of cytokine secretionCell culture supernatants were assayed for CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL12, and VEGF concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems, USA) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol.Proliferation assayFor proliferation assay, 10\u2009000 fibroblasts/well of 96 well-plate were cultured for 24 hr in presence of TGF\u03b2, NECA, or TGF\u03b2+NECA. Fibroblast proliferation was assessed after the addition of 1 \u03bcCi (0.037 MBq)/well of [3H]-thymidine (GE Healthcare, USA) for 18 hours. All measurements were performed in triplicate and presented as mean CPM \u00b1 SE.Real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated from cultured cells using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer\u2019s specifications. cDNA was generated and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) using ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) Primers used in RT-PCR were: CCL5 forward: 5\u2032-GCTGCTTTGCCTACCTCTCC-3\u2032, reverse: 5\u2032-TCGAGTGACAAACACGACTGC; CXCL1 forward: 5\u2032-CTGGGATTCACCTCAAGAACATC-3\u2032, reverse: 5\u2032-CAGGGTCAAGGCAAGCCTC-3\u2032; CXCL12 forward: 5\u2032-TGCATCAGTGACGGTAAACCA-3\u2032, reverse: 5\u2032-TTCTTCAGCCGTGCAACAATC-3\u2032; VEGF forward: 5\u2032-CTGCCGTCCGATTGAGACC -3\u2032, reverse: 5\u2032-CCCCTCCTTGTACCACTGTC-3\u2032; \u03b1SMA forward: 5\u2032-GTCCCAGACATCAGGGAGTAA-3\u2032, reverse: 5\u2032- TCGGATACTTCAGCGTCAGGA-3\u2032; MMP9 forward: 5\u2032\u2013CTGGACAGCCAGACACTAAAG\u2013 3\u2032, reverse 5\u2032-CTCGCGGCAAGTCTTCAGAG\u20133\u2032; \u03b2-actin forward: 5\u2032\u2013GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG\u2013 3\u2032, reverse: 5\u2032\u2013CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT\u2013 3\u2032. Relative mRNA expression in each sample was normalized to \u03b2-actin and presented using the comparative Ct method (2\u0394Ct).Gel contraction assayThe collagen gel was prepared from rat-tail collagen type I (Corning, USA), USA) at 3 mg/ml, 10 \u00d7 Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA), 10 x NaHCO3, and sterile ddH2O. Immortalized mouse mammary fibroblasts (400,000 cells per assay); primary fibroblasts, isolated from mouse mammary gland (200,000 cells per assay); human fibroblasts cell lines (200,000 cells per assay); and CD11b+ cells, isolated from subcutaneous implanted LLC tumors (600,000 cells per assay), were embedded into collagen gels. Cell/gel mixture was placed in 24 well plates for 48 hr. Gels were treated with TGF\u03b2 (1 ng/ml), NECA (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 uM), AMP and ATP (both Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (100 uM) for 16\u201318 hr. After incubation, collagen gel plaques were detached from the bottom of the well for contraction evaluation. The change in collagen gel size (contraction index) was quantified with image analysis software (NIH ImageJ).Migration assayImmortalized mouse mammary fibroblasts; primary mouse fibroblasts, isolated from mouse mammary glands were serum-starved (2% FBS, 12hr) and incubated with NECA and TGF\u03b2 for 16-18hr. After incubation, 30.000 cells were transferred onto cell culture inserts (polycarbonate membrane, 8um pore size, Corning, USA) and left for 3hr (immortalized mouse mammary fibroblasts) or 12 hr (primary mouse and human fibroblasts cell lines) to assess migration. The membranes from the inserts were stained with DAPI, imaged and number of cells was counted.Statistical analysisResults were presented as Mean \u00b1 SEM. Multiple comparisons between groups were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s procedure for multiplicity adjustment. Two-group comparison was performed using two-sample t tests or Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test as appropriate. The gene expression was normalized across all arrays. Gene symbols were assigned using the manufacturer-provided annotation, but the analysis was performed at probe level. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 Software (GraphPad Prism, USA) or R version 3.6.0ResultsAdenosine counteracts TGF\u03b2-mediated effects on protein expression in mouse mammary fibroblastsIn our recently published work, in MMTV-PyMT mouse tumor model, we have determined that impact of TGF\u03b2 on CD73 expression on myeloid cells associates with the ability of adenosine to regulate TGF\u03b2 signaling on mammary fibroblasts. We reported that this paracrine two-cell type (myeloid cell\u2014fibroblasts) negative feedback loop mechanism may contribute to a novel adenosinergic mechanism of TGF\u03b2 regulation in the tumor microenvironment and represents a potential therapeutic target. While we have observed changes in ECM deposition that correlated with decreased tumor growth and metastasis in MMTV-PyMT mouse tumor model, the role of adenosine in the regulation of broad TGF\u03b2-dependent fibroblast functions\u2014migration, contraction, and protein secretion need to be clarified.To determine how adenosine can modulate gene expression profile of fibroblasts, we have assessed CCL5 (RANTES), CXCL1 (KC), CXCL12 (SDF1a), MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9), aSMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). These proteins are known regulators of tumorigenesis and we have successful studied them in the past.We have incubated mouse mammary fibroblasts with TGF\u03b2, NECA and TGF\u03b2+NECA and measured gene expression (Fig 1). NECA was used in 10 uM concentration as previously, resembling the level of adenosine in solid tumors; this concentration activates both A2a and A2b adenosine receptors. We found that NECA counteracts TGF\u03b2 inhibitory effect on CCL5, CXCL12, but lessens upregulated MMP9 (Fig 1A). Interestingly, we observed that NECA, exhibits no effect on \u03b1SMA (ACTA2) by itself, was able to completely abolish TGF\u03b2-induced \u03b1SMA upregulation (Fig 1A). We followed our studies with ELISA assays to confirm RT-PCR data and found same changes for CCL5 and CXCL1 proteins (Fig 1B). While we have observed similar tendency for CXCL12 and VEGF, these changes have not reach significance in NECA + TGF\u03b2 group vs. TGF\u03b2 only. Next, in proliferation assays, we have not found that NECA is able to modulate TGF\u03b2 effect on fibroblast proliferation (Fig 1C). Finally, to dissect adenosine receptor subtype, responsible for mentioned above effects on TGF\u03b2, we have utilized mammary fibroblasts, isolated from WT, A2a-KO, and A2b-KO mice. We observed that effects on CCL5 and ACTA2 were regulated by both A2a and A2b adenosine receptors, whereas effects on expression of MMP9 was modulated through A2b adenosine receptors (Fig 1D).Effect of adenosine on TGF\u03b2 dependent proteins.A) qPCR analysis of immortalized mouse mammary fibroblasts.

Cells were used in passage 1 and incubated with TGF\u03b2 and/or NECA.Adenosine changes TGF\u03b2 induced mammary fibroblasts migration and gel contractionWe found that NECA affects TGF\u03b2 induced \u03b1SMA expression (Fig 1A) indicating that motility and contractility of fibroblasts can be regulated through adenosine/TGF\u03b2 axis. To estimate the contribution of TGF\u03b2 and NECA to these processes we have performed gel contraction and migration assays using mouse mammary fibroblasts. We found that NECA decreases TGF\u03b2- induced gel contraction with EC50 2.4 uM (Fig 2A). Migration assay revealed that TGF\u03b2 downregulates migratory ability, but NECA with EC50 0.27 uM counteracts this effect (Fig 2B). Considering 10-fold difference in EC50 for these two assays we have hypothesized that different types of adenosine receptors are involved in regulation of TGF\u03b2-mediated migration and contraction of fibroblasts. To check this hypothesis, we have utilized primary mammary fibroblasts, isolated from WT, A2a-KO, and A2b-KO mice. We demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-induced gel contraction was modulated by NECA via A2b adenosine receptors, whereas migration was regulated through both A2a and A2b adenosine receptors (Fig 2C and 2D). Overall, TGF\u03b2/adenosine axis regulates not only secretory functions of mammary fibroblasts but is involved in modulation of their migratory and contractility abilities as well. In addition, this mechanism demonstrates dependency on concentration of adenosine and can be mediated through different subtypes of adenosine receptors.Effect of adenosine on fibroblast migration and gel contraction.A) Gel contraction assay of mouse mammary fibroblasts.

Graphs show gel area, mm2 for gel contraction or % of migrated cell over the control group. TGF\u03b2 and NECA concentrations are the same as in A and B.Adenosine regulates TGF\u03b2 actions on mammary fibroblasts through adenylyl cyclase\u2014protein kinase A dependent mechanismIn our previous work, we have demonstrated that adenosine directly impacts TGF\u03b2 signaling evident by reduced pSmad 2/3, a major complex of TGF\u03b2 canonical signaling pathway. To dissect further the receptor subtype, mediated this effect, we show that wild type mouse mammary fibroblasts, incubated with TGF\u03b2 in presence of NECA do not respond by Smad phosphorylation, whereas A2a-KO and A2b-KO fibroblasts retain this response (Fig 3A). To continue to evaluate the molecular interplay between adenosine and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways we have investigated influence of NECA on TGF\u03b2-induced synthesis of collagen 1 (Col I) utilizing pharmacological approach. We have used WT primary mammary fibroblasts and antagonists of A2a (SCH58261) and A2b (PSB603) receptors. Western blot assay demonstrated that TGF\u03b2 induced Col I synthesis affected through A2b receptor (effect PSB603). To look at downstream of Gs and Gq signaling that mediates through adenylyl cyclase (AC) or phospholipase C (PLC) cascade (Fig 3B), we have used activator of AC (Forskolin) and inhibitors of PLC (U73122) and protein kinase A (PKA) (H89). Forskolin recapitulated effect of NECA, blocking TGF\u03b2 ability to stimulate Col I synthesis. We found that PSB603 and H89 were able to recover some of TGF\u03b2-induced Col I synthesis in presence of NECA, whereas SCH58261 did not show this effect (Fig 3C and 3D). These pharmacological studies demonstrate that the adenosine influences TGF\u03b2 actions through activation of adenylyl cyclase and activation of PKA.Molecular mechanism of adenosine in regulation TGF\u03b2 signaling.A) Representative Western blotting for pSMAD3 in mouse mammary fibroblast isolated from WT, A2a-KO, and A2b-KO mice.

Here, we have measured mouse mammary fibroblasts function in a gel contraction assay in respond to co-incubation with CD11b+ cells, isolated from LLC tumors that were s.c. implanted to WT, CD39-KO and CD73-KO mice (Fig 4A) in presence of ATP (substrate for CD39) and AMP (substrate for CD73). Our preliminary data showed that effective concentration of ATP and AMP for gel contraction assay is 100 uM. Myeloid cells (CD11b+) alone do not contract gel with or without ATP/AMP incubation (Fig 4B). Fibroblasts alone respond to TGF\u03b2 by gel contraction with no effect by AMP, but slightly inhibitory effect by ATP (Fig 4B). We observed that co-incubation fibroblasts with CD11b+ cells with AMP and ATP reduces gel contraction in comparison to TGF\u03b2 group. In a group of mammary fibroblasts, co-incubated with CD39-KO CD11b+, we have observed reduction of contractility function only in presence of AMP, whereas in group with CD73-KO CD11b+ cells no changes were seen in presence of AMP or ATP (Fig 4C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that presence of CD39+CD73+ myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment can metabolize extracellular ATP, ADP and AMP into adenosine, which, in turn, can shape TGF\u03b2- induced functions of fibroblasts.Role of myeloid cells on gel contraction.A) FACS plots (DAPI-) before and after isolation of CD11b+ cells from s.c.

Cells were used in passage 1. CD11b cells were isolated from LLC implanted tumors by magnetic microbeads. Fibroblasts and CD11b cells were embedded to collagen gel and cultured 24 hr. TGF\u03b2 (1 ng/ml) and AMP/ATP (100 uM) was added for 6 hr. with following measurement of gel diameter.Adenosine diminish TGF\u03b2 effects on human fibroblastsTo determine if we can recapitulate the findings of adenosine impacting TGF\u03b2 actions on mouse mammary fibroblasts into human fibroblasts, we have used all available to us commercial human fibroblast cell lines: IMR-90 (lung), WS-1 (skin), BJ (skin, foreskin), hTERT (prostate), and WPMY-1 (prostate/stroma). In these comparative studies, we have performed gel contraction assay. We found that all mentioned above cell lines were responding to TGF\u03b2 by gel contraction (Fig 5, top panel), which was reduced in presence of adenosine (NECA) (Fig 5, bottom panel) by 1.8 fold (IMR-90), 3.5 fold (WS-1), 1.6-fold (BJ), 1.25-fold (hTERT) and 2.1-fold (WPMY-1). This effect is comparable to 1.5-fold decrease, observed in mouse mammary fibroblasts (Fig 2). We found selective sensitivity to adenosine among different cell lines with IMR-90 cell line being a most sensitive (EC50 2.86 uM) and WS-1 cells line\u2014a least sensitive (EC50 75 uM). Interestingly, we found IMR-90 was responding to the whole dose range of NECA with similar, albeit, variable response (at the lowest NECA 10\u22128 M: 1.5 fold change from baseline (TGF\u03b2 only), at the highest NECA 10\u22124 M: 1.8 fold change). Altogether these experimental results, combined with data presented in Fig 2, are suggestive that modulatory effect of adenosine to TGF\u03b2 on human fibroblasts is mediated through low affinity A2b adenosine receptor.Adenosine/TGF\u03b2 interaction in human fibroblasts.Gel contraction assay of human fibroblast cell lines.

Cell lines were embedded to collagen gel and cultured 24 hr. TGF\u03b2 (1 ng/ml) and NECA (0.01 uM\u2013 100 uM) were added in same time for 6 hr. with following measurement of gel diameter. Dotted line is the TGF\u03b2 only.DiscussionIn the current work we have provided analysis of the interaction between adenosine and TGF\u03b2 signaling and its impact on fibroblast function. Our group has reported that adenosine modulates TGF\u03b2-regulated protein expression. In addition, we demonstrated that adenosine regulates TGF\u03b2-induced cytoskeletal rearrangements and affects the migratory and contractility functions of fibroblasts. Additional experiments have shown that the observed changes are mediated through A2a/A2b subtypes of adenosine receptors. We have confirmed our hypothesis that myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment by generation of adenosine from extracellular ATP/AMP, can regulate TGF\u03b2-induced functions on fibroblasts through adenosine receptors. A more detailed investigation of the crosslink between adenosine and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways revealed a critical role of AC-PKA. Furthermore, we have reported that these modulatory effects of adenosine/TGF\u03b2 axis are evident in both murine and human fibroblasts.In cancer, tissue fibroblasts play diverse roles and participate in many processes related to the tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Fibroblasts synthesize a wide variety of cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, growth factors and matrix proteins that affect tumor microenvironment composition and activity. We found that NECA increases expression of CCL5 that was downregulated by TGF\u03b2. An et al., reported that CCL5 in the tumor microenvironment is associated with migration and invasion of tumor cells and macrophage phenotype alteration towards pro-tumorigenic. Secretion of CCL5 by fibroblasts in the tumor tissue is associated with changes of tumor cell behavior to more aggressive, the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, and the activation of angiogenesis.Fibroblasts play a key role in the development of tumor ECM by synthesis, folding, and secretion of a wide variety of ECM proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. Many reports indicate that CAFs participate in ECM remodeling acting predominantly as pro-tumorigenic agents. We have discovered a significant reduction of TGF\u03b2-induced expression of MMP9 by NECA. MMP9 participates in ECM remodeling, alteration of cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, and cleavage of membrane surface proteins and is associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. One of the most important pro-tumorigenic characteristics of ECM in the tumor microenvironment is providing mechanical signals for cancer cells and formation of invasion tracks. Current research work has elucidated that adenosine reduces the expression of \u03b1SMA that was upregulated by TGF\u03b2. In addition, a gel contraction assay revealed that NECA reduces TGF\u03b2-activated contraction. During tumor progression, fibroblasts undergo phenotype alterations and are characterized by upregulated \u03b1SMA expression. Expression of \u03b1SMA correlates with contractility of CAFs, which is crucial for mechanical ECM remodeling and is associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis. From another hand, fibroblasts can directly contribute to metastasis by direct involvement into group migration and invasion. Here, we report that NECA can overwrite TGF\u03b2 effect on fibroblast migration upregulating this function. This TGF\u03b2 aberrant respond can be associated with the aggressive behavior of tumors with reduced TGF\u03b2 signaling on fibroblasts.Our data suggest that adenosine regulates TGF\u03b2-mediated functions of fibroblasts mostly through A2a or/and A2b adenosine receptors. Purinergic signaling is a very complex system and includes diverse receptors that are characterized by differing expression on cell types, affinity to their ligands, and downstream signaling machinery. The P1 group includes four G-protein coupled adenosine receptors: A1, A2a, A2b, and A3, that are characterized by different affinities to adenosine. A1, A2a, A3 receptors transduce high affinity (EC50 in range of 0.1\u20130.7 uM) signals, while A2b receptors were suggested as low affinity receptors due they responsiveness to high concentrations of adenosine (EC50 in range 1\u2013100 uM). Importantly, latter conditions are observed only under pathological settings, including in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, our results suggest that the contractility of fibroblasts can be modulated through A2b adenosine receptors, while the migratory function is regulated through A2a and A2b receptors. TGF\u03b2 stimulated MMP9 expression was modulated through A2b receptors, at the same time expression of CCL5 and \u03b1SMA was controlled through both A2a and A2b receptors. In our previous work we have shown that adenosine can reduce the amount of TGF\u03b2-induced pSmad3 in mammary fibroblasts. In this current work we have further analyzed TGF\u03b2 signaling and have demonstrated that adenosine can modulate the phosphorylation of Smad and the synthesis of collagen in A2b-AC-PKA dependent manner. Forskolin, a well-known activator of AC, mimics the effects of NECA and demonstrates a reduction of Col I synthesis induced by TGF\u03b2.Morphogens like TGF\u03b2, Wnt and Sonic Hedgehog are characterized by a complex mechanism of signaling transduction. In addition, their signaling pathways demonstrate multiple crosslinks with each other and with signaling pathways of different active compounds. We have demonstrated that the interaction between TGF\u03b2 and adenosine signaling pathways is mediated in an A2a/A2b-AC-PKA dependent manner. Interestingly, Zhang et al., have reported that the activated Smad3/Smad4 complex can bind to the regulatory subunit of PKA holoenzyme, form a trimeric complex, and result in the activation of PKA without changing the cAMP concentration. Decreased TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 phosphorylation in presence of NECA can be caused by interruptions in TGF\u03b2 receptor binding, Smad2/3 complex interactions or in direct dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteasome degradation of pSmad3. TGF\u03b2 receptor activation can be regulated by a wide variety of intracellular proteins like BAMBI, FKBP12, Smurf, or Smad7. Smad6 and Smad7 (I-Smads) compete with R-Smads for receptor, Co-Smad binding, or participate in receptor degradation and their activation negatively regulates TGF\u03b2 signaling. Smurf E3 ligases affect several levels of the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway, promoting degradation of R-Smads, I-Smads and TGF\u03b2 receptors. Moreover, Smurf2 interacts with Smad7 to promote its binding with the activated TGF\u03b2 receptor complex, which leads to proteasome degradation of both activated TGF\u03b2RI and Smad7. We can speculate that there could be an undescribed mechanism of AC-cAMP-PKA regulation of Smurf activity that can affect Smad signaling. R-Smads can be dephosphorylated with subsequent degradation. Adenosine signaling can induce phosphatase activity increasing Smad2/3 dephosphorylation. TGF\u03b2 induces production of Col I, FN and CTGF by activation of Smad2, Smad3, ERK12, and p38 MAPK phosphorylation. This fact indicates that the A2a/A2b-AC-cAMP-PKA pathway affects the non-canonical shoulder of TGF\u03b2 signaling as well.In this current work, we have demonstrated that myeloid cells, isolated from mouse tumor tissue and co-cultured with mammary fibroblasts, generate adenosine which modulates TGF\u03b2-stimulated gel contraction. The ATP/ADP release into extracellular space can be caused by disrupting the cell integrity or by active secretion. Under normal conditions, accumulation of nucleotides and nucleosides in tissue is minimal and is essential for normal cell functioning. However, during various pathological condition their concentrations in extracellular space can be extreme. Extracellular ATP and ADP signaling is limited by degradation rate that is depends upon expression and activity of several membrane linked ectonucleotidases, including ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (CD39, CD39L, CD39L3), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase CD203a (NPP1), alkaline phosphate (ALP). Resulting metabolite of ATP/ADP hydrolysis is AMP that has no own receptor and hydrolyzes into adenosine by ecto-5\u2032-nucleotidase (NT5, CD73). Our group have demonstrated several types of cells that express CD39 and CD73 in the tumor microenvironment: immune cells (myeloid cells, T-cells), fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and neoplastic cells. In addition, we have identified terminally differentiated myeloid cell (TDMC), that co-express CD39 and CD73 and are a primary source of adenosine in the tumor tissue in a model of breast cancer. Number of research works demonstrated critical role of CD39 and CD73 in tumor development and patients\u2019 survival. In past, we have showed that downregulated expression of CD73 on myeloid cells correlated with reduced tumor growth and metastasis. Intriguing observation in this work was enhanced deposition of collagen in the tumor tissue revealed by histological analysis. We hypothesized that adenosine, produced by CD39+CD73+ cells can modulate TGF\u03b2 signaling on fibroblasts and change their ECM producing ability. In the current work, we are providing more detailed information about the role of adenosine in controlling TGF\u03b2-mediated fibroblast function. We found that adenosine regulates secretory, migratory and contractility functions of fibroblasts in an A2a and/or A2b dependent manner. The microenvironment of solid tumors is often associated with a high concentration of adenosine corresponding to activation of low affinity A2b subtype of adenosine receptors. We have determined that MMP9 expression and contractility function of fibroblasts appear to be regulated solely by A2b receptors. In summary, the data outlines A2b adenosine receptors as mediators of adenosinergic regulation of TGF\u03b2 actions on fibroblasts.To test the hypotheses that discovered mechanism is common for different types of fibroblasts and to demonstrate its transability to human, we have used cell lines generated from human lung (IMR-90), skin (WS-1, BJ), and prostate (WPMY-1, hTERT SMC PM151T) fibroblasts. TGF\u03b2 signaling in cancer-associated fibroblasts plays an important role for their activation, motility, contractile function, production of anti/pro-tumorigenic factors, and ECM synthesis and remodeling. On the other hand, there is an evidence that lack of TGF\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is correlated with poor cancer prognosis. Cheng et al. demonstrated that loss or lack of TGF\u03b2 signaling in mammary cancer associated fibroblasts increase tumor growth and metastasis. Oyanagi et al. showed that inhibition of TGF\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts can enhance migratory and invasive activity of Panc-1 cells in the model of pancreas cancer. Because origin of cancer tissue determines tumor development patterns, function of fibroblasts and TGF\u03b2 signaling in this type of cells can be regulated by different mechanisms. Modulation of TGF\u03b2 effects can be realized in different levels of signal transduction: regulation of accessibility of TGF\u03b2 ligand to its receptor, insufficient downstream signaling, and crosslink with other signaling pathways. Gel contraction assay has demonstrated ability of adenosine to decrease TGF\u03b2 induced contractility in different types of fibroblasts. Further investigation needed to elucidate the role of discovered phenomenon in progression of different types of cancer.The pleotropic functions of TGF\u03b2 during cancer progression is determined by the interplay with other signaling pathways that are activated in the tumor microenvironment or under other pathological conditions. Our data suggests a novel mechanism of adenosine/TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways interaction that defines CAFs phenotype in the tumor microenvironment. Current research work proposes the A2b receptor on fibroblasts as a target for anticancer therapy and can be used as a basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.Supporting
