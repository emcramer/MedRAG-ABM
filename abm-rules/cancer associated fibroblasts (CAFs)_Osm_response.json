    "## Potential Rules for Osm in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Osm increases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Oncostatin M (Osm) is a cytokine that can activate fibroblasts, potentially contributing to the transition from normal fibroblasts to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can become activated upon encountering cancer cells, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This activated state can promote the growth and invasion of the tumor. [Document 4] **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Osm increases IL-6 secretion from 0 towards 10 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Osm is known to activate the JAK/STAT pathway, which can lead to the production of IL-6. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that can promote tumor growth and metastasis. This rule reflects the observation that IL-6 is a major factor secreted by CAFs and that it can be induced by Osm. [Document 18] **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Osm increases transform to M2 from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10. **Justification:** Osm can polarize macrophages towards the M2 phenotype, which is associated with immunosuppression and tumor promotion. This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can be re-educated towards the M2 phenotype upon encountering certain signals, potentially due to the influence of the tumor microenvironment. [Document 1] **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Osm decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Osm can induce differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which are less motile. This rule reflects the observation that macrophages may become less motile upon encountering certain signals, potentially due to phagocytosis or other cellular processes. [Document 1] **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Osm decreases transform to epithelial from 0.01 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.2 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Osm can promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells, which is often associated with increased invasion and metastasis. This rule reflects the observation that inflammatory signals can suppress the activation of CAFs, potentially due to the immune response or other cellular processes. [Document 1] **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific model and the available data. "
