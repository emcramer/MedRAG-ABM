    "## Potential Rules for Postn in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) Here are some potential rules for Postn in CAFs, along with justifications based on the provided research papers: **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Postn increases migration speed. **Justification:** Periostin (Postn) is a secreted protein that plays a role in cell migration and invasion in various cancers, including ovarian cancer (Document [2]). Document [2] states that CAF-derived Postn functions as a ligand for integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, fueling the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. This suggests that Postn could also promote CAF migration. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Postn increases transform to activated. **Justification:** Document [0] states that Periostin (POSTN) is a secreted cell adhesion glycoprotein that plays an important role in proliferation, adhesion and migration processes, as well as in regulation of mechanisms related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Document [1] states that CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. Document [2] states that CAF-derived POSTN functioned as a ligand for integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, fueling the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These documents suggest that Postn could play a role in activating CAFs, potentially by promoting their proliferation, migration, and EMT. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, TGF-beta1 increases Postn secretion. **Justification:** Document [2] states that the pro-metastatic properties and the activation of fibroblasts induced by TGF-\u03b21 partly relied on POSTN. This suggests that TGF-\u03b21 could stimulate Postn secretion in CAFs. **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, contact with neoplastic epithelial cells increases Postn secretion. **Justification:** Document [0] states that POSTN expression was shown mainly in tumour stromal cells, i.e. cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Document [1] states that CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. Document [2] states that CAF-derived POSTN functioned as a ligand for integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, fueling the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway and inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These documents suggest that Postn secretion in CAFs could be influenced by the presence of neoplastic epithelial cells. **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, oxygen decreases Postn secretion. **Justification:** Document [10] states that biglycan (BGN), a soluble secreted protein, is upregulated in CAFs compared to normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs). Document [10] also states that the expression of biglycan was negatively correlated with CD8 + T cells. Document [10] further states that biglycan indicated poor prognostic outcomes and might be correlated with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). These documents suggest that Postn secretion in CAFs could be influenced by oxygen levels, potentially due to its role in immune suppression. **Rule 6:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, contact with dead cells decreases Postn secretion. **Justification:** Document [10] states that biglycan (BGN), a soluble secreted protein, is upregulated in CAFs compared to normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs). Document [10] also states that the expression of biglycan was negatively correlated with CD8 + T cells. Document [10] further states that biglycan indicated poor prognostic outcomes and might be correlated with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). These documents suggest that Postn secretion in CAFs could be influenced by the presence of dead cells, potentially due to its role in immune suppression. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided research papers and may not be exhaustive. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Postn in CAFs and its impact on tumor progression. "
