    "## Potential Rules for Lamb1 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Lamb1 increases migration speed. **Justification:** Lamb1 is a component of the basement membrane, and its expression has been shown to be increased in the stroma of breast cancer tumors [10]. Increased Lamb1 expression in the stroma could create a more permissive environment for fibroblast migration, potentially contributing to the spread of cancer cells. [10, 18] **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Lamb1 increases transform to activated. **Justification:** Lamb1 is a component of the basement membrane, and its expression has been shown to be increased in the stroma of breast cancer tumors [10]. Increased Lamb1 expression in the stroma could promote the activation of fibroblasts, potentially contributing to the formation of a more aggressive tumor microenvironment. [10, 18] **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Lamb1 increases secretion of pro-inflammatory factor. **Justification:** Lamb1 is a component of the basement membrane, and its expression has been shown to be increased in the stroma of breast cancer tumors [10]. Increased Lamb1 expression in the stroma could promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by fibroblasts, potentially contributing to the recruitment of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment. [10, 18] **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Lamb1 decreases secretion of anti-inflammatory factor. **Justification:** Lamb1 is a component of the basement membrane, and its expression has been shown to be increased in the stroma of breast cancer tumors [10]. Increased Lamb1 expression in the stroma could suppress the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors by fibroblasts, potentially contributing to the suppression of the immune response and promoting tumor growth. [10, 18] **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Lamb1 increases transform to M1. **Justification:** Lamb1 is a component of the basement membrane, and its expression has been shown to be increased in the stroma of breast cancer tumors [10]. Increased Lamb1 expression in the stroma could promote the polarization of macrophages towards the M1 phenotype, potentially contributing to increased tumor cell killing. [10, 18] **Rule 6:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Lamb1 decreases transform to M2. **Justification:** Lamb1 is a component of the basement membrane, and its expression has been shown to be increased in the stroma of breast cancer tumors [10]. Increased Lamb1 expression in the stroma could suppress the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype, potentially contributing to reduced immunosuppression and promoting tumor cell killing. [10, 18] **Rule 7:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Lamb1 increases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can become activated upon encountering cancer cells, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This activated state can promote the growth and invasion of the tumor. [1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74] **Rule 8:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Lamb1 decreases transform to epithelial from 0.01 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.2 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that inflammatory signals can suppress the activation of CAFs, potentially due to the immune response or other cellular processes. [1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74] **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific research question and the specific triple-negative breast cancer model you are using. "
