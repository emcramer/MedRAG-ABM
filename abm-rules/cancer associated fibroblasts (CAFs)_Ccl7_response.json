    "## Potential Rules for CCL7 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL7 increases migration speed. **Justification:** CCL7 is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and has been shown to promote the migration and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (Document [1]). This suggests that CCL7 could also promote the migration of CAFs, which are known to be highly motile cells. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL7 increases transform to activated. **Justification:** CCL7 is a chemokine that can promote the activation of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment (Document [1]). This suggests that CCL7 could also promote the transformation of CAFs to a more activated state, which is often associated with increased tumor-promoting activity. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL7 increases secretion of pro-inflammatory factor. **Justification:** CCL7 is a pro-inflammatory chemokine that can promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the tumor microenvironment (Document [1]). This suggests that CCL7 could also promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by CAFs, which could further contribute to the inflammatory environment of the tumor. **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL7 increases transform to M2 from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10. **Justification:** CCL7 is a chemokine that can promote the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype (Document [4]). This suggests that CCL7 could also promote the transformation of CAFs towards an M2-like phenotype, which is often associated with immunosuppression and tumor promotion. **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL7 increases transform to epithelial from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** CCL7 is a chemokine that can promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells (Document [1]). This suggests that CCL7 could also promote the transformation of CAFs towards an epithelial-like phenotype, which is often associated with increased tumor growth and invasion. **Rule 6:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL7 increases transform to mesenchymal from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** CCL7 is a chemokine that can promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells (Document [1]). This suggests that CCL7 could also promote the transformation of CAFs towards a mesenchymal-like phenotype, which is often associated with increased tumor growth and invasion. **Rule 7:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, CCL7 increases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** CCL7 is a chemokine that can promote the activation of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment (Document [1]). This suggests that CCL7 could also promote the transformation of CAFs towards a more activated state, which is often associated with increased tumor-promoting activity. **Note:** These rules are based on the information provided in the documents and are intended to be a starting point for designing your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific model and the specific biological processes you are interested in. "
