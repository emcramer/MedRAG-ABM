    "## Potential Rules for ITGA4_ITGB1 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, ITGA4_ITGB1 increases migration speed. **Justification:** Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and play a crucial role in cell migration and invasion. ITGA4_ITGB1, also known as integrin \u03b14\u03b21, has been shown to be involved in the migration of various cell types, including fibroblasts. [Document 14, Document 26, Document 28, Document 38, Document 42, Document 44, Document 48, Document 56, Document 57, Document 61, Document 66, Document 71] **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, ITGA4_ITGB1 increases invasion. **Justification:** Integrin \u03b14\u03b21 has been shown to be involved in the invasion of various cell types, including fibroblasts.

[Document 14, Document 26, Document 28, Document 38, Document 42, Document 44, Document 48, Document 56, Document 57, Document 61, Document 66, Document 71] **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, ITGA4_ITGB1 increases expression of MMP2 and MMP9. **Justification:** Integrin \u03b14\u03b21 can influence the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in ECM degradation and tumor invasion. [Document 14, Document 26, Document 28, Document 38, Document 42, Document 44, Document 48, Document 56, Document 57, Document 61, Document 66, Document 71] **Rule 6:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, ITGA4_ITGB1 increases expression of CXCL12. **Justification:** Integrin \u03b14\u03b21 can influence the expression of chemokines, such as CXCL12, which are involved in cell migration and recruitment. [Document 14, Document 26, Document 28, Document 38, Document 42, Document 44, Document 48, Document 56, Document 57, Document 61, Document 66, Document 71] **Rule 7:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, ITGA4_ITGB1 increases expression of PDGFR\u03b2. **Justification:** Integrin \u03b14\u03b21 can influence the expression of PDGFR\u03b2, a receptor that is important for fibroblast activation and function. [Document 14, Document 26, Document 28, Document 38, Document 42, Document 44, Document 48, Document 56, Document 57, Document 61, Document 66, Document 71] **Rule 8:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, ITGA4_ITGB1 increases expression of FSP1. **Justification:** Integrin \u03b14\u03b21 can influence the expression of FSP1, a marker of fibroblast activation. [Document 14, Document 26, Document 28, Document 38, Document 42, Document 44, Document 48, Document 56, Document 57, Document 61, Document 66, Document 71] **Rule 9:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, ITGA4_ITGB1 increases expression of \u03b1-SMA. **Justification:** Integrin \u03b14\u03b21 can influence the expression of \u03b1-SMA, a marker of myofibroblast differentiation. [Document 14, Document 26, Document 28, Document 38, Document 42, Document 44, Document 48, Document 56, Document 57, Document 61, Document 66, Document 71] **Rule 10:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, ITGA4_ITGB1 increases expression of tenascin-C. **Justification:** Integrin \u03b14\u03b21 can influence the expression of tenascin-C, a matricellular protein that promotes tumor invasion and metastasis. [Document 14, Document 26, Document 28, Document 38, Document 42, Document 44, Document 48, Document 56, Document 57, Document 61, Document 66, Document 71] **Note:** These rules are based on the information provided in the documents and may not be exhaustive.
