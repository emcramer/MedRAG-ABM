Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. ***p \u2264 0.001 using \u0394Ct valuesTo evaluate the effect of COX-2 expression on structural ECM changes, we characterized Col1 fiber distribution in 1 mm-thick fresh tumor slices using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, shown in Figure 4A, demonstrate the reduction in colonization and establishment of pulmonary metastasis following COX-2 downregulation.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

D. Quantification of Col1 fiber volume and fiber distribution in lung nodules. Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse. A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA.

Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

Tumors of the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer (TNBC; generally corresponding to the \u201cBasal/Basal-like\u201d subtype of patient datasets, determined by PAM50 gene signatures) lack the expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1, progesterone receptor and HER2, are highly aggressive and are most likely to recur. Unlike the luminal-A tumors that are characterized by better survival, or the HER2+ tumors, TNBC/basal tumors cannot be treated by receptor-targeted therapies and demonstrate high relapse rates following chemotherapy.As with other malignancies, breast tumors develop and progress within an intimate tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies indicate that stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key regulators of tumor progression in cancer. In general, MSCs enrich the TME with tumor-promoting factors, and endow the tumor cells with improved abilities to invade and generate metastases; MSCs also undergo transition to CAFs that promote breast cancer/TNBC progression. Particularly in TNBC, MSCs contribute to higher aggressiveness by promoting the expression of angiogenic factors and pro-metastatic chemokines such as the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts). The axes established by these chemokines and their receptors are well-known for their pro-tumorigenic roles, including in TNBC [e.g., ].Tumor-educated MSCs evolve within a TME enriched with inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which generally promote breast cancer progression. Two such pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). It was demonstrated that despite its potential anti-tumor cytotoxic activities, chronic presence of TNF\u03b1 in tumors has led to tumor progression. Joined with the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory activities of IL-1\u03b2, the two cytokines were identified as pro-metastatic factors in many tumor types. In TNBC, sequencing, serum-profiling and immunohistochemistry studies of small patient cohorts provided initial evidence to relevance of high expression of the two cytokines or of their signaling components to metastasis in TNBC patients; in parallel, studies in animal models have demonstrated causative tumor-promoting roles for TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also connected with pro-malignancy activities of MSCs and CAFs in TNBC. Specifically with regards to chemokines, we and others have shown that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 elevated the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts) by MSCs [; the degree of increase depended on assay conditions], thus promoting the pro-inflammatory and pro-malignancy phenotype of these stromal cells.However, to date, we still lack understanding of the interactions that are established between TNBC cells, stromal cells and their intimate pro-inflammatory TME, and we do not have enough information on the way such interactions affect disease course. Specifically, it is not known whether the pro-metastatic characteristics of the TME and of the tumor cells are increased when TNBC cells interact with MSCs/CAFs in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Thus, the aim of our present study was to identify the influence of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage on the content of pro-metastatic chemokines as proxies for potential pro-malignancy activities that enrich the TME of TNBC tumors, as well as on angiogenesis and on the migratory, invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells.In view of their high relevance to tumor progression in TNBC, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were selected as representatives of the pro-inflammatory TME in our study. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of TNBC:stroma co-cultures by these two cytokines has led to increased pro-metastatic activities at multiple levels, including: expression levels of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, cancer cell morphology, tumor cell migration and tumor cell invasion. Importantly, we found that CXCL8 was a key regulator of the pro-metastatic activities that came into play in the TNBC-stroma-inflammation networks, including angiogenesis, metastasis-related morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Moreover, the tumor-stroma-inflammation network has promoted the metastatic potential of TNBC cells and has led to elevated metastasis in vivo. Parallel in-culture studies that were performed with tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with luminal-A cells demonstrated that in general they were less potent or differently active than those established with TNBC cells.Thus, our findings set the pro-inflammatory inputs acting at the tumor:stroma interface, and their pro-metastatic outputs, as targets for improved therapy in TNBC. Since inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are used vastly in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, our findings suggest that these two cytokines may be considered as novel therapeutic modalities in TNBC. Such an approach, combined with the use of chemokine receptor inhibitors [e.g., of the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2; ], may prevent tumor-stroma interactions that increase metastasis in TNBC.Materials and MethodsAnalyses of Patient DatasetsRNAseq-based gene expression analyses of breast cancer patient data were performed with the TCGA dataset. Subtypes were defined based on the PAM50 annotation file provided within the dataset: Basal (often overlapping the term TNBC): 141 patients; Luminal-A: 421 patients. Gene expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were determined. In all analyses, log2-transformed expression values of the genes were presented. Statistical analyses were performed following Shapiro-Wilk test, determining the normality of distribution for each gene by individual subtype. Comparisons of gene expression levels between the two clinical subtypes were presented in boxplots. p-values were determined by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The distribution of gene expression levels in basal and luminal-A patients was presented in histograms, where statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. In studies correlating the expression levels of the different genes, correlation coefficients and p-values were analyzed using Spearman correlation. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Breast Tumor Cell Lines and Stromal CellsThe human TNBC cell lines (all from ATCC) included: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells that were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Life technologies, Grand island, NY); BT-549 cells that were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Biological Industries); for BT-549 cells, recombinant human (rh) insulin (10 mg/ml; #I9278; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the medium. The human luminal-A cell lines MCF-7 (from ATCC) and T47D [provided by Dr. Keydar who generated the cell line ] were grown in culture in the same medium as MDA-MB-231 cells. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial ST1.6R cells (HPMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Unger and Dr. Kirkpatrick, Institute of Pathology, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. These cells were grown as described in Krump-Konvalinkova et al., with minor modifications.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from Lonza (#PT-2501; Walkersville, MD), which validated them as MSCs based on cell markers and differentiation potential. Routine growth of MSCs took place in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (#PT-3001; Lonza) or in MesenCult (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) and they were used for up to 10 passages. In this study, MSCs of four different healthy donors were used. Patient-derived CAFs from a primary breast tumor (used in ELISA and their accompanying signaling experiments) and from a lung metastasis (used in tumor cell invasion assays) were kindly provided by Dr. Bar, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel). The cells were grown, identified and immortalized as described in Katanov et al..TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Concentrations Used in Different AnalysesTitration studies were initiated by determining the ability of rhTNF\u03b1 (#300-01A, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and rhIL-1\u03b2 (#200-01B, PeproTech) to elevate in MDA-MB-231 cells and/or MSCs/CAFs the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and/or CCL5 to levels that enabled us to perform the required comparisons between different cell combinations in ELISA studies (concentrations studied - TNF\u03b1: 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2: 20, 100, 250, 350, 500, 750 pg/ml). The selected concentrations of 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2 were appropriate also for MSC and CAF experiments. Therefore, in all MDA-MB-231 studies, alone or with MSC/CAF, these selected concentrations were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments.In parallel, titration studies indicated that the above selected concentrations were not optimal for ELISA responses of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cells; thus, based on additional analyses, the concentrations of cytokines were raised in these two cell types: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. These selected cytokine concentrations were used in all studies of MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells, alone or with MSCs.The effects of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 on morphological changes, angiogenesis, migration and invasion with MCF-7 cells were determined in the same concentrations as used for MDA-MB-231 cells (10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2). In ELISA studies (and their accompanying signaling experiments) in MCF-7 and T47D cells cytokine concentrations were raised to 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. Although published data [e.g., ] and our past studies indicated that lower TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (as in MDA-MB-231 cells) induce signaling and up-regulate the levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 in MCF-7 and T47D cells, we expected that these cytokine concentrations will not enable us to clearly distinguish \u201cintermediate\u201d levels of chemokine induction in ELISA assays. Thus, cytokine concentrations were increased, as described above.Western Blot StudiesBased on kinetics analyses (Data not shown), cells were stimulated for 15 min by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle (similar for both cytokines), in medium containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, followed by conventional Western blot (WB) procedures. The following antibodies (Abs) were used: Phosphorylated (P)-p65 [#3033; Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA]; Total (T)-p65 (#8242; CST); P-JNK (#4668; CST); T-JNK (#9258; CST). Abs directed against GAPDH (#ab9485; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) served for loading controls. The membranes were reacted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (#111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (#20-500, Biological Industries).Cell Stimulation in Co-culture ExperimentsTNBC or luminal-A cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs/CAFs (10:1 ratio) in 6-well plates (#3516, Corning, Kennebunk, ME). When relevant, \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures were grown in similar plates, in which the two cell types were separated by an insert of 0.4 \u03bcm permeable polycarbonate membrane (#3412, Corning). In parallel, each cell type was grown individually in the same cell numbers as in co-cultures, in similar plates. The cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS for 12 h, and were then treated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle for 7 h in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Then, media were replaced by cytokine-free media (with 0.5% FBS) for additional 60 h. Cell conditioned media (CM) were removed and taken for ELISA assays. When indicated, CM and cell lysates were produced from cells that were subjected to gene down-regulation by siRNA, as detailed below. Cell lysates were produced from cells grown in larger vessels 7 h or 15 min after the beginning of cytokine stimulation and were used in quantitative real-time PCR analyses (qRT-PCR) or in WB studies.ELISA AssaysCM obtained from different stimulatory conditions were cleared by centrifugation, followed by determining the expression levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 by ELISA. Standard curves at the linear range of absorbance were produced with rhCXCL8, rhCCL2 and rhCCL5 (#200-8M, #300-04 and #300-06, respectively; PeproTech). The following Abs were used (all from PeproTech, unless otherwise indicated): For CXCL8 - Coating Abs: #500-P28; Detecting Abs: #500-P28Bt. For CCL2 - Coating Abs: #500-M71; Detecting Abs: #500-P34Bt. For CCL5 - Coating Abs: #500-M75; Detecting Abs: #BAF278 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (#016-030-084; Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories) was added, followed by the substrate TMB/E solution (#ES001; Millipore, Temecula, CA); then, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To provide data on the contents of chemokines generated in each of the treatments and to clearly denote the differences in chemokine production between the different conditions, the findings are presented in ng/ml.In reversibility experiments, MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 for 67 h or exposed to vehicle control. Media were replaced and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in TNF\u03b1-free media. CM that were collected following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal, were subjected to ELISA analysis of CXCL8 expression as described above.qRT-PCR AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted using the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400; Biological Industries). Using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX), first-strand cDNA was generated from RNA samples. cDNA targets were quantified by qRT-PCR on Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science, Concorde, NSW, Australia). Absolute Blue qPCR SYBR Green ROX mix (#AB-4163/A; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect transcripts, according to manufacturer's instructions. Two pairs of specific primers were used (Supplementary Table 1), designed to span different exons. Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Dissociation curves for each primer set indicated a single product, and \u201cno-template\u201d controls were negative after the 40 cycles used for analysis. Quantification was performed by standard curves, within the linear range of quantification.Endothelial Cell Migration and SproutingTo generate CM for functional in vitro angiogenesis assays, MDA-MB-231:MSC and MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10:1 cell ratio in each) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 7 h; in parallel, CM were produced from tumor cells that were treated by vehicle, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1, or from tumor cells grown with MSCs only. Media were removed and the cells were cultured for additional 60 h in TNF\u03b1-free medium (with 0.5% FBS). CM were collected, cleared by filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane, and loaded in the lower part of migration transwells (#3422, Corning) with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes. The migration of HPMEC cells in direction of the different CM was determined after up to 90 min. At the end of the experiments, cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes, the membranes were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained by Hemacolor (#1.11661; Merck). Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple bright fields were counted.In parallel, CM were also used in sprouting assays of mCherry-expressing HPMECs out of 3D multicellular spheroids (all generated by the same cell number) that were formed in hanging drops for 24 h and embedded into collagen type I (1.3 mg/ml; #354236; Corning). Sprouting of endothelial cells in response to CM was visualized by fluorescent microscopy after 10 days, and was determined quantitatively in multiple spheroids by mCherry signals of cells that sprouted out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ.Tumor Cell Morphology, Migration and InvasionIn morphology assays, \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-expressing tumor cells - MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 - and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 67 h; in parallel, mCherry-tumor cells were grown with vehicle, with TNF\u03b1 only or with MSCs only. Then, tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy at x100 magnification, in multiple fields. In reversibility experiments of MDA-MB-231 cells, media were replaced in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures after 67 h, and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in cytokine-free medium. Morphology was determined following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal.Migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in transwells with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes (#3422, Corning). In these assays, mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were added to the upper part of the chambers, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. The same number of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in parallel transwells, in the presence of vehicle control or of TNF\u03b1 alone. Migration was performed for 12 h toward medium containing 10% FBS [containing TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, as appropriate]. The numbers of migrating tumor cells were determined by staining with rabbit Abs to RPF (recognizing mCherry; #PM005; MBL, Woburn, MA), followed by DyLight 550-conjugated Donkey Abs recognizing rabbit IgG (#ab96920, Abcam). Cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Based on DyLight 550 signals and Hemacolor staining used in preliminary analyses (Data not shown), we validated that close to 100% of migrating cells were the tumor cells. Photos of multiple high power fluorescent fields were taken at \u00d7 100 magnification. Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple fluorescence fields were counted.Migration of Hoechst-labeled MCF-7 cells was determined by using the same experimental groups as in TNBC studies. MCF-7 cells are known as having a relatively low basal migratory potential, thus appropriate conditions were set, based on published studies and preliminary analyses in our lab. Thus, the membranes were coated with fibronectin for 1 h (20 \u03bcg/ml; #03-090-1, Biological Industries), cells were loaded to the upper part and after 21 h photos were taken. Hoechst-expressing tumor cells that migrated to the lower side of the membranes were counted in multiple fields.Tumor cell invasion assays were performed using 3D multicellular spheroids that were generated for 72 h in hanging-drops [, with minor modifications]. Spheroids of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, consisting of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs/CAFs (ratio 10:1) were embedded into matrigel (9\u201310.5 mg/ml; #356234, Corning) and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Spheroids were also formed with mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells alone, and treated by TNF\u03b1 or by vehicle (same number of cells as in co-cultures). Invasion of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells was determined 48 h after the addition of cytokine stimulation (or vehicle). Multiple spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields at x40 magnification. The invaded area was determined by the mCherry signals of cells that invaded out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ. Invasion of MCF-7 cells was determined in a similar manner after 96 h, using mCherry-MCF-7 cells and patient-derived CAFs, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or its vehicle control. Spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields 96 h after the addition of stimulation, at \u00d7 40 magnification.CXCL8 Down-Regulation by siRNAKnock-down of CXCL8 expression by transient siRNA transfections was performed in both MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs, using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (#56531; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGET plus siRNA CXCL8 SMART pool and non-targeting control siRNA pool (siCTRL) were used (#L-004756-00 and #D-001810-10, respectively; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The efficacy of CXCL8 down-regulation was validated by qRT-PCR or ELISA [Data not shown; 80\u201390% as in ] and the cells were used in assays, as necessary.Tumor Growth and Metastasis\u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs (10:1 ratio) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or vehicle control, in 0.5% FBS-containing medium for 67 h. In each group (Group 1: Co-culture with TNF\u03b1; Group 2: Co-culture with vehicle), the same amount of live co-cultured cells was mixed 1:1 with matrigel (final concentration 4.5 mg/ml; #356234; Corning). The cells were administered orthotopically to the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (#NUDE242; Envigo RMS, Jerusalem, Israel). During the experiment, tumors of Group 1 were supplemented every 3 days by CM taken from MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures; these CM were generated as follows: The co-cultures were stimulated for 7 h with TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), after which the cytokine was removed, and CM were collected after additional 60 h of growth in cytokine-free and serum-free medium. These CM were filtered, concentrated \u00d7 10, and administered in proximity to tumors. Cytokine- and serum-free media that were put in parallel flasks have undergone similar procedures, and were administered to tumors of Group 2. At the endpoint of experiments (when tumors reached detectable sizes and had to be removed prior to necrosis), approximately 30 days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were sacrificed and primary tumors and lungs were excised. Tumor weights were determined, and tumor volumes were calculated based on caliper measurements. Lung metastases were determined ex vivo by the CRi Maestro non-invasive intravital imaging system. The total number of mice that were included in two biological repeats were 12 in Group 1, and 11 in Group 2. Statistical analyses of primary tumor weight and volume were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. The proportions of mice bearing lung metastases were compared by Fisher's exact test. Procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines and policies.Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysesThe statistical analyses of TCGA analyses and in vivo experiments were described in their respective sections. In vitro experiments were performed in n \u2265 3 independent experimental repeats, with MSCs from \u22652 different donors, as indicated in respective figure legends. The results of ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, HPMEC sprouting and tumor cell migration and invasion assays were compared by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling the FDR at 0.05. All the significant results remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity, except for some of the WB results. It these latter cases lack of significance was due to high variance between the intensities of effects of the experimental repeats of the test, despite the fact that they all demonstrated the same trend. Thus, in presentation of WB analyses we demonstrate not only the average and standard deviations (SD) of the experimental repeats but also the level of effect in each experiment.ResultsHigh Expression Levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Are Noted in Tumors of Basal Patients and Are Significantly Coordinated With High Expression Levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5To identify the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating tumor-stroma interactions in TNBC, we have extended currently-available studies on TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients and compared the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in two subtypes of breast tumors: (1) Basal tumors, corresponding to the TNBC subtype, which has a most aggressive phenotype; (2) Luminal-A tumors having the best prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes.Here, by using the TCGA breast cancer dataset we found that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were expressed in significantly higher levels in basal tumors than in luminal-A tumors (Figures 1A1,B1). Distribution analyses (Figures 1A2,B2) demonstrated a larger proportion of basal patients with high TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels, than luminal-A patients. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, chosen as proxies for pro-tumorigenic factors that may be enriched in basal patients due to pro-inflammatory signals. These studies demonstrated significantly higher levels of the three chemokines in basal patients than in luminal-A patients (Figures 1C\u2013E).The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their chemokine targets are significantly higher in basal patients than in luminal-A patients. The Figure demonstrates gene expression analyses, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) TNF\u03b1, (B) IL-1\u03b2, (C) CXCL8, (D) CCL2, (E) CCL5.

(A2\u2013E2) Histograms demonstrating the distribution of expression levels of each of the factors in basal and luminal-A patient tumors. RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Moreover, as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are key inducers of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 expression [e.g., ] we also determined the correlation between the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and each of the three chemokines in basal patients. The findings of Figure 2 indicate that the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly correlated and coordinated with the presence of CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 in basal tumors.In basal patients, the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are significantly coordinated with the expression levels of their chemokine targets. The Figure demonstrates correlation analyses of gene expression in basal patients, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) CXCL8 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (A1) and IL-1\u03b2 (A2). (B) CCL2 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (B1) and IL-1\u03b2 (B2). (C) CCL5 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (C1) and IL-1\u03b2 (C2). RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Pro-metastatic Chemokines Reach Their Highest Expression Levels When TNBC:Stroma \u201cContact\u201d Co-cultures Are Stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2To follow up on the above findings, we asked how the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 regulate TNBC:MSC interactions that may lead to elevated release of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. First, we validated that the two cytokines could activate transcription pathways that typically induce the expression of these chemokines, namely NF-\u03baB/p65 and JNK/AP-1. Indeed, these pathways were rapidly activated by a brief TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of 15 min (time point and cytokine concentrations were determined by preliminary analyses) in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and in MSCs (Figure 3A).CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK, determined by WB in MSCs and in human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells upon 15 min stimulation by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle control (based on kinetics and titration studies. Information on cytokine concentrations is given in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). GAPDH was used as a loading control. (A1) A representative experiment and (A2) averages \u00b1 SD of p65 and JNK activation (fold induction) in n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. ***p < 0.001, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between the values obtained for cytokine-stimulated cells and control non-stimulated cells. Dashed line stands for the value of 1 given to control cells. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels were determined in TNBC:MSC co-cultures or each of the cell types grown alone, with or without TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs were generated in \u201cTranswell\u201d and \u201cContact\u201d conditions and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (350 pg/ml) or vehicle control (similar for both cytokines) for 7 h. After change of media and growth for additional 60 h, the extracellular expression of CXCL8 in TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-free CM was determined by ELISA. ***p \u2264 0.001, **p \u2264 0.01, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between TNF\u03b1- or IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells and vehicle-treated cells, within each group. #p-values were <0.01 or <0.001 (in most cases) in comparisons of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments, as well as in comparisons of \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments. The results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.Then, to determine if CXCL8 is regulated by tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures were plated in \u201cContact\u201d conditions that enabled direct physical contacts between the two cell types or in \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions that allowed only for the exchange of soluble factors between tumor cells and stromal cells. These co-cultures and each cell type alone were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (or their vehicle) for 7 h (Cytokine concentrations were selected based on titration assays, as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d); the cytokines were removed and cytokine-free CM were collected 60 h later. These experiments revealed that the highest levels of CXCL8 were produced when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B1), and that they were higher than in all other conditions including non-stimulated co-cultures and individual cell types treated with either cytokine. CXCL8 protein levels were elevated also in cytokine-stimulated \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions; however, their total levels (ng/ml) were significantly lower than in cytokine-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 3B1). Accompanying qRT-PCR analyses indicated that CXCL8 induction was regulated at the transcription level (Supplementary Figure 1A), and that increased CXCL8 levels in cytokine-stimulated co-cultures did not result of elevated proliferation of the cells under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 2). Accordingly, we did not detect any substantial cell death or proliferation of any of the cell types due to cellular interactions or cytokine stimulation (Data not shown).Additional experiments revealed similar regulatory modes for CCL2, demonstrating its highest expression levels in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures, obtained partly in a contact-dependent process (Figure 3B2). With CCL5, absolute dependence on TNBC:MSC contacts was revealed, and its expression was further elevated when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B3). As with CXCL8, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 by elevating their mRNA levels (Supplementary Figures 1B,C).Additional analyses performed with TNBC cells that interacted with breast cancer patient-derived CAFs revealed similar regulatory patterns to those described above with MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures: TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation in CAFs (Figure 4A) and elevated all three pro-metastatic chemokines to their highest levels of expression when tumor-stroma-inflammation interactions took place (Figure 4B); moreover, CXCL8 and CCL2 up-regulation depended partly on cell-to-cell contacts whereas induction of CCL5 was fully dependent on direct physical contacts between the tumor cells and the CAFs, and was further induced by stimulation with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:CAF \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, using similar cytokine concentrations. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.In view of the high heterogeneity of TNBC tumors, we asked if similar regulatory patterns exist in co-cultures of other human TNBC cells - MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 - with MSCs. The findings of Figure 5A indicate that in both cell lines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation and that the highest CXCL8 expression levels were produced when these TNBC cells physically interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5B). Of interest, the elevation in CXCL8 levels following cytokine stimulation of MDA-MB-468:MSC co-cultures partly depended on physical contacts between the two cell types (Figure 5B1), as was seen in MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures (Figure 3B1). In parallel, in BT-549:MSC co-cultures, CXCL8 elevation in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells depended on cell-to-cell contacts, while TNF\u03b1 did not have much of an impact under \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 5B2).Increased production of CXCL8 is a general characteristic of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with TNBC cells. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with human TNBC MDA-MB-468, BT-549 cells and MSCs. Cytokine concentrations: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. \u2227In panel 5B1, this value was significant in 2 out of 3 experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.To follow up on the data of Figure 1, indicating that the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their targets - CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 - were significantly lower in luminal-A patients than in basal patients, we determined how these three chemokines are affected by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of luminal-A:MSC co-cultures. Despite the fact that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced potent p65 and JNK activation in T47D and MCF-7 luminal-A cells (Figures 6A, 7A), CXCL8 levels were not increased but rather were decreased when the tumor cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figures 6B1, 7B). In parallel, CCL2 and CCL5 levels were increased by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated T47D:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (Figures 6B2,B3), but their expression levels were, in general, much lower than those obtained by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures (Figures 3B2,B3). Further studies with MCF-7 luminal-A cells demonstrated elevations in the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 in some of the assays under \u201cContact\u201d co-culture conditions following TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation; however, the expression levels of these chemokines were often too low to provide clear-cut results (Data not shown).CXCL8 expression is down-regulated in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated luminal-A (T47D): MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with T47D cells and MSCs.

To this end, in the TNBC part we focused on the MDA-MB-231 cells because of their high metastatic potential. In luminal-A studies we chose to investigate MCF-7 cells because of our previous research indicating that they expressed more robust metastasis-related properties than T47D cells when stimulated by pro-inflammatory signals; additional investigations by our group also indicated that MCF-7 cells responded vigorously to TNF\u03b1-containing TME signals in in vivo metastasis studies.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Established With TNBC Cells Lead to Elevated AngiogenesisTo determine the functional consequences of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, we first determined the ability of factors released by TNBC:MSC co-cultures stimulated by TNF\u03b1 to promote processes involved in angiogenesis. Here, endothelial cells (HPMEC) sprouting assays demonstrated conclusive evidence to higher angiogenesis-supporting potential of TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC (Supplementary Figure 3) compared to CM obtained from control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, these studies did not reveal concrete information on the angiogenic potential of CM obtained from tumor cells + MSCs or from tumor cells + TNF\u03b1. Thus, additional studies were designed to provide another level of information on the ability of CM derived from the different groups to induce the migration of HPMEC in response to CM derived from different conditions. This assay enabled us to clearly demonstrate that the highest levels of endothelial cell migration were achieved when MDA-MB-231 cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 8A). Moreover, our findings emphasized the contribution of TNF\u03b1 to the angiogenic potential revealed by tumor cells grown in the presence of stromal cells.The pro-angiogenic activities of factors released by tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are promoted by TNF\u03b1 in TNBC but not in luminal-A cells.

Photos and their quantifications are representatives of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.We then performed parallel studies with luminal-A MCF-7 cells and found that CM of \u201cContact\u201d MCF-7:MSC co-cultures had strong angiogenic activities as with TNBC cells (Figure 8B); however, in contrast to our studies with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8A), in studies of MCF-7 cells TNF\u03b1 did not push the angiogenic response induced by CM of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures any further.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Promote the Migratory and Invasive Properties of TNBC CellsNext, we determined the effects of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network on tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. First, we found that in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, the tumor cells acquired very elongated morphology (Figure 9A1) which is typical of cells that express high motility capabilities. The morphology of the tumor cells under this condition was robustly different from the morphology of tumor cells grown alone, of tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and of tumor cells grown with MSCs only (Figure 9A1). These studies were followed by migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells, known as having an aggressive phenotype which is manifested by a relatively high basal migratory potential. Despite their high basal motility, the interactions of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 have led to significantly higher migratory capacity of the tumor cells compared to tumor cells grown alone (Figure 9A2). Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells grown in the presence of MSCs only or with TNF\u03b1 alone did not migrate as well as tumor cells grown with MSCs and TNF\u03b1 (Figure 9A2). Supplementary Figure 4 demonstrates representative photos of MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated in the different study groups, identified by fluorescent staining.TNBC cells, and less so luminal-A cells, acquire migration-related characteristics upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1.

In all sections of Part (B), the Figures demonstrate representative experiments of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of \u22652 different donors.In parallel, experiments performed with MCF-7 cells indicated that their morphology was modified by TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 9B1) toward a metastasis-relevant phenotype [in line with our findings in ]. MCF-7 cells that grew in contact with MSCs also demonstrated modifications in their morphology, different than those induced by TNF\u03b1 stimulation. However, in contrast to our findings with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A1), when TNF\u03b1 was added to MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, no additivity was found between TNF\u03b1 and the MSCs in inducing more robust morphological changes in the tumor cells (Figure 9B1). Of note, the TNF\u03b1-stimulated MCF-7 cells that grew in co-culture with MSCs acquired elevated migratory capacity compared to control cells (Figure 9B2; Supplementary Figure 5). However, the overall migratory potential of MCF-7 cells at the tumor-stroma-inflammation setting (Figure 9B2) was much lower of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A2), although the two cell types were plated in same numbers in migration transwells. The relatively low migratory capacities of MCF-7 cells were noted despite the fact that they were given the proper conditions to support their migration (fibronectin coating of membranes and longer migration time than MDA-MB-231 cells).To follow up on these findings, we investigated the ability of TNBC cells to invade out of 3D spheroids, a process requiring migration and invasion through extracellular proteins. We noted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells when they interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 10), compared to all other cell combinations. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells exerted significantly increased invasion also when they interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the context of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 11A; Please see \u201cNote\u201d in the legend of Figure 11A). In contrast to the TNBC cells, MCF-7 luminal-A cells that interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 demonstrated very minor, if any, invasive properties (Figure 11B), even after longer invasion time compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (96 h for MCF-7 cells; 48 h for MDA-MB-231 cells).TNBC cells acquire elevated invasive properties upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1. The Figure demonstrates tumor cell invasion out of 3D spheroids that were formed by mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) alone or by tumor cells in \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs. The spheroids were imbedded into matrigel and then stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle for 48 h. (A) Representative photos. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.

To connect between these two processes, we asked if CXCL8 - selected because of its robust pro-angiogenic activities and pro-metastatic effects at the levels of TME and the tumor cells alike - was involved in mediating the functional properties of TNBC cells when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established.To this end, we generated TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in which CXCL8 was down-regulated in high efficiency by siRNA in the tumor cells and in the MSCs simultaneously [80\u201390% efficiency was found in CXCL8 down-regulation by the siRNA, similar to our findings in our parallel study; that study also demonstrates which of the cells contributed more to CXCL8 production when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established with MDA-MB-231 cells]. The findings of Figure 12 clearly indicate that CXCL8 played significant roles in driving forward all metastasis-related alterations that were induced by the tumor-stroma-inflammation network in TNBC. Here, we found that in the absence of CXCL8 expression, endothelial cell migration in response to CM of TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures was significantly reduced (Figure 12A). Moreover, upon CXCL8 down-regulation, the migration-relevant morphology of the tumor cells was partly reversed (Figure 12B), and the migration and particularly the invasion potentials of the tumor cells were significantly reduced (Figures 12C,D).Tumor-stroma-inflammation networks lead through CXCL8 activities to increased angiogenesis, invasion-related tumor cell morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) and MSCs were both transfected by siCXCL8 or siCTRL. Parallel studies indicated that the efficiency of CXCL8 down-regulation was high [80\u201390% in most experiments, as in; Data not shown]. The cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml); then, the cells or their CM were assayed in the following tests: (A) Endothelial cell migration (Procedures as in Figure 8A). ***p < 0.001; (B) Tumor cell morphology (Procedures as in Figure 9A1).

Yet, they have not directly determined the impact of the pro-inflammatory signals on tumor growth and metastasis when TNBC:stroma interactions are established. Our above findings motivated us to determine whether the pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 to TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in vitro would potentiate tumor growth or metastasis in an animal model system.The ability of TNF\u03b1 to potentiate the in vivo aggressiveness of TNBC cells grown with MSCs requires that the in vitro advantages given to the tumor cells by their 3-day exposure to MSCs and to the cytokine, will persist in vivo (the cytokine is removed prior to injection to mice); Thus, we first determined whether the increased pro-metastatic capabilities endowed on the tumor cells by their co-culturing with stromal cells in the presence of TNF\u03b1 withhold when TNF\u03b1 is removed. To this end, TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were established for 67 h with TNF\u03b1 stimulation, leading to high CXCL8 levels and clear changes in tumor cell morphology (Figures 13A,B); then, TNF\u03b1 was removed and the growth of TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures was continued in TNF\u03b1-deprived medium for ~2 weeks. The findings of Figure 13 demonstrate that the effects of TNF\u03b1 were reversible: ~2 weeks after TNF\u03b1 removal the elevation in CXCL8 was completely abolished (Figure 13A) and the elongated cell morphology was almost entirely diminished (Figure 13B).TNF\u03b1 promotes the metastatic potential of TNBC cells grown in contact with MSCs. (A,B) Reversibility of TNF\u03b1-induced tumor-promoting phenotypes, generated in vitro in \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures following TNF\u03b1 removal. mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 67 h (termed \u201c~3 days of TNF\u03b1 stimulation\") (A1,B1). Then, vehicle-treated and TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSCs co-cultures were re-cultured without further TNF\u03b1 stimulation for additional 10\u201314 days (termed \u201c~3 days of stimulation + ~2 weeks W/O TNF\u03b1 stimulation) (A2,B2). At both time points (~3 days and ~2 weeks), extracellular CXCL8 levels were determined in cell supernatants by ELISA (A) and tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy (B). ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant. Bar, 50 \u03bcm. In all panels of section (A,B), the results are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. (C,D) mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, for 67 h (~3 days). Then, co-cultured cells were injected to the mammary fat pad of nude mice in 2 independent experiments (For additional experimental details please see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Total mice numbers were: (1) In the group of mice administered with TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures: n = 12; (2) In the group of mice administered with vehicle-exposed co-cultures: n = 11. At the end of the experiment (~30 days post injection), primary tumor size was determined by volume (C1) and weight (C2). ns=non-significant. (D) Metastases in lungs were detected by mCherry signals using the Cri Maestro fluorescence imaging system. \u2227p = 0.095.Taking into account these findings on reversibility of TNF\u03b1-mediated effects, proposing that the benefits that were provided by TNF\u03b1 stimulation to TNBC:MSC co-cultures may not persist in vivo, we proceeded to the animal system setting. Here, we introduced an experimental design that will enable us to directly assess the impacts of TNF\u03b1 on the metastatic potential of TNBC cells when they interacted with stromal cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 for 67 h, and were compared to vehicle-exposed MDA-MB-231:MSC cultures, serving as controls. The cells were then administered to the mammary fat pads of female mice. To strengthen in vivo the possible effects of TNF\u03b1 when it acted on MDA-MB-231 and MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, CM containing factors released by TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (but deprived of TNF\u03b1 itself) were injected in proximity to tumors generated by TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures; in parallel, control media were administered to tumors arising from injection of vehicle-treated co-cultures. The findings of Figure 13C indicate that the sizes and weights of primary tumors were similar in the two groups of mice; however, most importantly, the metastatic potential of the tumor cells that interacted with MSCs was increased by in-culture TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 13D). This effect was revealed by the elevated incidence of mice carrying lung metastases following MDA-MB-231 co-culturing with MSC under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in vitro, compared to the control group in which the co-cultured cells were not exposed to TNF\u03b1 (Figure 13D).DiscussionThe fundamental roles of the TME in promoting cancer progression are now well-appreciated, with stromal cells and pro-inflammatory elements being key contributors to disease development and metastasis. In the complex milieu that exists in tumors, cross-talks between the different TME players and the tumor cells eventually establish intricate networks whose roles in dictating disease course are still poorly defined and characterized.In the present study, we were particularly interested in elucidating the roles of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks in regulating tumor progression in TNBC, a most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In our study, we have used potent and most clinically relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines - TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 - that are expressed in breast tumors and have pro-metastatic functions in TNBC. Our study provides novel findings indicating that interactions between TNBC cells and MSCs/CAFs in the presence of such pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to significantly enhanced pro-metastatic phenotypes of the TME and of the tumor cells themselves. This was illustrated by increased expression of pro-metastatic chemokines, by elevated ability to induce angiogenesis, as well as by higher migratory and invasive capabilities of the tumor cells. Ultimately, the end result of the activities of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was a higher metastatic potential of TNBC cells in vivo.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network was found in our study to strongly induce the expression of the pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. These chemokines are pro-inflammatory factors and as such contribute to cancer inflammation by recruiting myeloid inflammatory cells, as well as immune-suppressive cells, to tumors and metastases. In addition, of the three chemokines, particularly CXCL8 but also CCL2, are potent angiogenic factors that contribute to TNBC progression. Moreover, direct activities of the chemokines on tumor cells have led to increased invasion in TNBC cells.As part of their pro-metastatic roles in TNBC, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors - for example, CXCR2 for CXCL8 and CCR2 for CCL2 - contributed to the pro-tumorigenic activities of stromal cells in TNBC mouse model systems. MSC/fibroblast-derived chemokines, including murine CXCL1 and CXCL2 (counterparts of human CXCL8), CCL2 and CCL5 were associated with recruitment of neutrophils, tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to TNBC tumors, where they promoted disease course. CXCL8 and CCL5, produced by bone marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs were prime inducers of metastasis in TNBC, acting by elevating the proliferation and invasive properties of the tumor cells, and their resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, MSC-derived CCL2 has attracted macrophages to TNBC tumors, activating them to secrete CXCL8, thus leading to an overall increase in tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells.The above studies strengthen the relevance and importance of our observations on the strong induction of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 when TNBC cells interacted with MSCs/CAFs in the context of pro-inflammatory stimuli, introduced by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. As noted above, both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were found to be responsible for increased aggressiveness in TNBC, and in several studies were connected to increased pro-malignancy functions of MSCs/CAFs. For example, the findings by Shi and colleagues indicated that TNF\u03b1-activated MSCs promoted via CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands the metastatic ability of murine TNBC cells. TNF\u03b1-primed MSCs were also found to reprogram neutrophils to acquire immunosuppressive functions. Other studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-231-derived CM elevated IL-1\u03b2 release by MSCs, increasing their pro-inflammatory nature. In parallel, MSC-derived IL-1\u03b2 increased the proliferation and chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.However, these studies did not address the wider scope of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network, and did not identify the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating TNBC-stroma interactions. Here, our current study provides novel findings, emphasizing the need for both TNBC:MSC cross-talk and pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, in order to achieve the most substantial levels of pro-metastatic activities: high levels of pro-metastatic chemokines, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, our findings suggest that previous studies on TNF\u03b1-treated MSCs that induced anti-tumor activities in TNBC tumors may have overlooked the actual setting that takes place in vivo, when TNBC cells interact with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation.Of major importance in this context is the fact that CXCL8 was revealed in our current study as a key player in mediating the pro-metastatic functional effects of the inflammation-driven tumor-stroma networks in TNBC: angiogenesis, migration-related morphology of the tumor cells, as well as cancer cell migration and invasion. The effects of CXCL8 down-regulation on these pro-metastatic functions in TNBC was pronounced, and our results suggest that it can probably act in cooperativity with other factors that are produced under these network conditions to promote the aggressiveness of TNBC cells that interacted with stromal cells in the context of the pro-inflammatory TME.Here, it is interesting to note that the tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established by luminal-A cells were less potent or differently active than those generated in TNBC, in all aspects: chemokine production, angiogenesis, and tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. These findings may reflect the fact that TNBC cells and luminal breast tumor cells interact differently with fibroblasts. They also agree well with our TCGA results demonstrating lower expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and of the three chemokines in luminal-A patients compared to basal patients. Ultimately, these findings may provide a partial explanation to the more aggressive clinical course of TNBC tumors compared to luminal-A tumors.Overall, our observations suggest that at the TME of TNBC tumors, which is enriched with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the two pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate tumor-stroma interactions that occur at the tumor site, and that under these conditions the in vivo aggressiveness of the tumor cells is increased. It would be interesting to establish similar systems with murine TNBC cells and investigate the possible effects of similar tumor-stroma-inflammation networks and of specific corresponding mouse chemokines on the immune and inflammatory contextures of mice tumors and metastases. Such systems may also enable further analyses that correlate the extent of stroma cell presence with the extent of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as with patterns of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network identified in our study suggests that inhibiting the activities of TNBC-typical pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 would halt tumor-stroma interactions that stand in the basis of TNBC progression. Indeed, inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are in clinical use in inflammatory diseases and were found to inhibit the aggressiveness phenotype of TNBC cells. Obviously, implementation of inhibitory modalities to these cytokines in the in vivo and even more so in the clinical setting would require improved understanding of the entire context of their activities; for example, the activation and regulatory networks of TNF\u03b1 and its TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors take place at multiple regulatory levels that need improved understanding.These considerations emphasize the relevance of the metastatic chemokines that are elevated due to the activity of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage, particularly CXCL8, to therapy. Inhibitors of the axes of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors are also available, suggesting that treatments of TNBC cancers with combination therapies of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may provide novel treatment options for TNBC patients.Ethics StatementAll procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policies.Author ContributionsYL generated all data, and was extensively engaged in study design and manuscript preparation.

This microenvironment provides all the necessary stimuli for tumour survival, growth, and invasiveness. Inflammatory cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines they produce are essential components of this microenvironment.Monocytes originating from blood differentiate into either M1 or M2 subtype macrophages, depending on the environmental stimuli they receive. Human M1 macrophages demonstrate elevated expressions of CD14, CD16, CD64, CD86, and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR\u03b1; whereas, CD163 and CD206 are markers associated with M2 macrophages. In breast cancer, macrophages represent up to 50% of the tumour mass and there exists a correlation between the number of tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) and poor prognosis. Macrophages have roles in almost all stages of tumour progression. In the primary tumour, they stimulate angiogenesis and facilitate invasion. During metastasis, macrophages prepare the pre-metastatic site and promote tumour cell dissemination as well as growth. They also generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment by disrupting natural killer (NK) and T cell functions. TAMs usually resemble M2 macrophages. During tumour development, tumour-infiltrating M1-polarized macrophages are generally identified by an IL-12high IL-10low phenotype and they enhance immune reactions that display anti-tumour effects. During late-stages of tumour progression, TAMs generally skew to an M2-like phenotype that is characterized by an IL-12low IL-10high phenotype and diminished tumouricidal activity. The identification of molecules driving macrophage plasticity in the cancer microenvironment could provide a basis for macrophage-focused diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Fibroblasts are one of the most abundant cell types found in the tumour stroma. Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. As tumours are described as \u201cwounds that never heal\u201d, CAFs are very similar to myofibroblasts, which are spindle shaped activated fibroblasts. Although there is no specific marker that is exclusively expressed by CAFs, alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) is widely used as a CAF marker. CAFs not only play an active role in tumour initiation and progression, but also sculpt the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as regulators of immune cell recruitment as well as functions. Studies in breast cancer investigating the effects of stromal fibroblasts on monocytes/macrophages are very limited. In this study, we report for the first time that CAFs obtained from invasive breast cancer differentiated monocytes to M2-like pro-tumoural macrophages in terms of both phenotypic features and functions, in contrast to fibroblasts obtained from normal breast. We also demonstrated that CAFs were very effective in recruiting monocytes. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) were found to be crucial monocyte chemotactic cytokines that were secreted from stromal cells.ResultsCAFs, which are \u03b1-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to NFs, effectively recruit monocytesCAFs are \u03b1-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to NFs. CAFs and NFs were cultured in 8-well chamber slides, then stained for vimentin (A,D), pan-cytokeratin (B,E) and \u03b1-SMA (C,F). Both CAF and NF cells were positive for vimentin and negative for pan-cytokeratin. However, CAFs were positive for \u03b1-SMA, unlike NFs. Sup. Figure\u00a01 displays immunocytochemical stainings for fibroblast activation protein (FAP). One representative figure for each cell type is shown (\u00d7100).CAFs were isolated from breast cancer tissues obtained from patients undergoing mastectomy. As healthy counterparts, we used normal fibroblasts (NFs) isolated from normal breast tissues obtained from patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty. Primary cultures of both of those isolated fibroblasts were established. All fibroblasts utilized in the experiments were characterized by vimentin, pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-SMA expressions by immunocytochemistry. They differed in their expressions of \u03b1-SMA, which was consistently negative in NFs (n\u2009=\u20093) and positive in CAFs (n\u2009=\u20094). Representative figures of NFs and CAFs are shown in Fig.\u00a01.CAF and MDA-MB-231 cells effectively recruit monocytes. Monocytes isolated from healthy donors were serum starved and then were allowed to migrate for 5\u2009h toward CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) Representative microscopic views of each condition are shown (i: Standard Medium, ii: CM from NFs, iii: CM from CAFs, iv: CM from MDA-MB-231 Cells). (B) CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in monocyte migration more than NFs did. The presence of CXCR4 (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml) or MCP-1 (130\u2009\u00b5g/ml) blocking antibodies diminished monocyte recruitment. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. standard medium, #p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. each corresponding control. Arrows demonstrate migrated/counted monocytes.In order to evaluate the effects of CAFs and breast cancer cells on monocyte recruitment, we performed cell migration assays. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy humans. Conditioned mediums (CMs) collected from CAFs, NFs, and breast cancer cells were used in a Boyden migration assay, in which monocytes migrate toward CM in the bottom chamber. Our results demonstrated that CAFs as well as breast cancer cells recruited monocytes effectively (Fig.\u00a02A,B).Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by MCP-1 as well as SDF-1 cytokinesIn order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying monocyte recruitment by CAFs, we focused on MCP-1 and SDF-1 cytokines. Our results showed that inhibiting MCP-1 or SDF-1 activity through MCP-1 or CXCR4 (a chemokine receptor specific for SDF-1) blocking antibodies, respectively, reduced monocyte migration, significantly. Although both SDF-1 and MCP-1 are relevant for monocyte recruitment mediated by both CAF and breast cancer cells; SDF-1 seems to be more important for CAF-induced monocyte recruitment, while MCP-1 is more prominent for breast cancer cell mediated monocyte migration (Fig.\u00a02B).CAFs induce a pro-tumoural phenotype, which resembles M2 macrophages like TAMs, in monocytes/macrophages in contrast to NFsCAF and MDA-MB-231 cells induce monocytes to differentiate into a M2 phenotype similar to TAMs. CD14+ PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured with CMs from NFs (NF-educated monocytes), CAFs (CAF-educated monocytes), MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes) or standard culture medium DMEM (control monocytes) for 7 days, then were analysed using flow cytometry. (A) The expression levels of PD-1, CD163, and CD206 were significantly higher in CAF-educated monocytes than in NF-educated monocytes. The expression levels of HLA-DR and CD14 were significantly lower in CAF-educated monocytes than in NF-educated monocytes. Representative histograms of each molecule are shown. (B) Data are presented as relative fold changes to control IgG in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.We established an in vitro model utilizing CD14+ cells isolated from healthy donors and CMs obtained from CAFs, NFs, and breast cancer cells in order to investigate the effects of the tumour stromal cells as well as the tumour cells on monocyte differentiation. Following 7 days of culture, the expressions of CD163 and CD206, which are mostly associated with M2 macrophages, were higher in CAF-educated cells than in NF-educated cells. In addition, the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was higher in CAF-educated cells than in NF-educated cells. In fact, NF-educated cells\u2019 expressions of PD-1, CD163 and CD206 were similar to control monocytes. On the other hand, the expression of CD14 was much higher in NF-educated cells than in CAF-educated cells. In addition, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR) expression of CAF-educated cells is much lower than that of NF-educated cells as well as breast cancer cell-educated monocytes. The expressions of CD86 were comparable between the groups (Fig.\u00a03).CAF-educated monocytes exhibit strong immunosuppressionCAF-educated monocytes suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation more than NF-educated monocytes did. CAF-educated monocytes, NF-educated monocytes, MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes, control monocytes were co-cultured with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelled and autologous CD4+ T cells that were activated by CD3/CD28 magnetic beads for 96\u2009hours. (A) The proliferation of T cells was suppressed by CAF-educated monocytes more strongly than control and NF-educated monocytes. Suppression of T-cell proliferation by CAF-educated monocytes is E:T dependent (normalized percentage of suppression of T-cell proliferation considering respective control monocytes are 40.1% and 53.3% for 1:4 and 1:2 E:Ts, respectively). (B) Representative histograms of the proliferation of T cells (monocytes:CD4+ T cells, 1:4). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.We investigated whether CAF-educated monocytes could inhibit T-cell proliferation. For this purpose, human autologous CD4+ peripheral T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads were co-cultured with control monocytes, NF-, or CAF-educated monocytes. As shown in Fig.\u00a04, CAF-educated monocytes markedly suppressed T-cell proliferation in effector-cell-to-target-cell-ratio (E:T) dependent manner; since a higher E:T seems to result in a more prominent immunosuppression (Fig.\u00a04B).CAF-educated monocytes enhance the motility of breast cancer cellsCAF-educated monocytes induce increased motility of MDA-MB-231 cells. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for 24\u2009hours. (A) Representative microscopic views of tumour cells that show invasion are shown (i: Standard Medium, ii: CM from Control Monocytes, iii: CM from CAF-educated Monocytes, iv: CM from NF-educated Monocytes, v: CM from MDA-MB-231-educated Monocytes). (B) Tumour cells that show invasion were counted and presented in bar graphs. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. standard medium. Arrows demonstrate counted tumour cells that show invasion.CAF-educated monocytes modify the expressions of EMT-related proteins and genes. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for 24\u2009hours. (A\u2013D) The effects of NF-, CAF- or MDA-MB-231-educated monocyte CMs on the EMT of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were analysed by Western blot analysis of vimentin and E-cadherin proteins. Densitometry shows relative protein expression normalized for GAPDH (n\u2009=\u20093). (E\u2013G) The effects of NF-, CAF- or MDA-MB-231-educated monocyte CMs on the EMT of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR of Snail, Slug and Twist gene expressions (n\u2009=\u20093). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. **p\u2009<\u20090.01. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001. ns: not significant.In order to investigate the effects of CAF-educated monocytes on the motility of breast cancer cells, we treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with CMs from CAF-, NF-, or MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes. The invasion of breast cancer cells was enhanced by the effects of CAF-educated monocytes (similar to MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes), whereas the invasion of breast cancer cells was not significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of control monocytes (Fig.\u00a05). In addition, we investigated the changes in expressions of EMT-related proteins of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes. For this reason, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with CMs from CAF-, NF-, or MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes. Vimentin expression was found to be increased and E-cadherin expression was found to be decreased in breast cancer cells by the effects of CAF-educated monocytes. On the contrary, neither vimentin nor E-cadherin expression was significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of control monocytes (Fig.\u00a06A\u2013D). Real-time qPCR results showed that CAF-educated monocytes induce breast cancer cell expressions of Snail, Slug and Twist genes; which are EMT-related genes, both compared with control monocytes and with NF-educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a06E\u2013G).CAFs re-direct differentiated M1 macrophages to M2-like macrophagesCAF and MDA-MB-231 cells induce M1 macrophages to differentiate into M2-like macrophages. (A) M1 macrophages were subsequently cultured with CMs from CAFs or MDA-MB-231 cells. After 48\u2009hours, cells were analysed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of CD163 and CD206 were significantly higher in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages than in M1 macrophages alone. Representative histograms of each molecule are shown. (B) Data are presented as relative fold changes to control IgG in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. (C) M1 macrophages were cultured alone or with CMs from CAFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells for 48\u2009hours and the levels of IL-12 or IL-10 were measured by ELISA. Levels of IL-12 was decreased in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages compared with that in M1 macrophages alone. In contrast, levels of IL-10 increased in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages compared with that in M1 macrophages alone. *p\u2009<\u20090.05.We then set out to explore whether CAFs were able to induce the differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. For this reason, we cultured M1 macrophages with CMs of CAFs as well as breast cancer cells. After 2 days, the expression of CD163 significantly increased in M1 macrophages treated with CMs of either CAFs or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; as a result, resembling the surface expression of M2 macrophages (Fig.\u00a07). Even though CD206 expressions of CAF- or breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages slightly increased, such increases were not found to be statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07B); whereas, CD206 expression of CAF-educated monocytes was shown to increase significantly (Fig.\u00a03B). In addition, we determined IL-10 and IL-12 cytokine levels in culture supernatants. IL-12 cytokine levels decreased in the supernatants of both CAF- and breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages. On the other hand, IL-10 cytokine levels seem to have slightly increased in the supernatants of both CAF- and breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages, although this increase was not found to be statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07C).High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in breast cancer tissue samplesCorrelation between the number of macrophages positive for CD163, and CD206 as well as \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts in breast tumour stroma with clinical and pathological features.\tNo. of cases\tCAF grade\u2021\tCD163+ macrophages*\tCD206+ macrophages*\t \tLow (n\u2009=\u200927)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200923)\tp value\u2020\tLow (n\u2009=\u200925)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200925)\tp value\u2020\tLow (n\u2009=\u200928)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200922)\tp value\u2020\t \tAge\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u226450\t27\t16\t11\t0.57\t16\t11\t0.25\t13\t14\t0.26\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>50\t23\t11\t12\t\t9\t14\t\t15\t8\t\t \tGrade\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\t8\t6\t2\t0.26\t7\t1\t0.04\t3\t5\t0.27\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\t42\t21\t21\t\t18\t24\t\t25\t17\t\t \tKi-67 index#\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u22645%\t4\t4\t0\t0.02\t4\t0\t0.03\t3\t1\t0.60\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>5%\t25\t8\t17\t\t9\t16\t\t13\t12\t\t \tLymph node involment\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Negative\t26\t13\t13\t0.58\t13\t13\t1.00\t16\t10\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Positive\t24\t14\t10\t\t12\t12\t\t12\t12\t\t \tTumor size\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u22642\u2009cm\t17\t13\t4\t0.03\t13\t4\t0.01\t9\t8\t0.77\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>2\u2009cm\t33\t14\t19\t\t12\t21\t\t19\t14\t\t \tMolecular subtypes\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ER/PR(+)\t16\t10\t6\t0.66\t9\t7\t0.09\t8\t8\t0.44\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HER2(+)\t11\t6\t5\t\t8\t3\t\t8\t3\t\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Triple negative\t23\t11\t12\t\t8\t15\t\t12\t11\t\t \t*The median values of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophage numbers in stroma within the areas were used to divide the patients into high and low grade groups.\u2021The grades of CAF area in stroma were used to divide the patients into two groups (low and high grade).#Ki-67 index was evaluated in 29 tissue samples.\u2020Data were analysed by Fisher\u2019s exact test and chi-squared test, and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.We analysed the presence of macrophages positive for CD163 and CD206 as well as \u03b1-SMA positive fibroblasts in 50 human breast cancer samples using immunohistochemistry. We divided the sample group into high and low grade groups based on the median number of CD163+ macrophages (64; range 18\u2212151), and CD206+ macrophages (15; range 2\u201350). We then analysed the associations of TAM grade with clinical and pathological features (Table\u00a01). High level of infiltration of stromal CD163+ macrophages was associated with higher histologic grade, higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. High CAF grade was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume (Table\u00a01).High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in breast cancer tissue samples. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD163, CD206, \u03b1-SMA, and Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) in breast cancer samples are shown. \u03b1-SMA (A), CD163 (B), CD206 (C), and H&E (D) were stained in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissue sample. \u03b1-SMA (E), CD163 (F), CD206 (G), and H&E (H) were stained in a HER2+ breast cancer tissue sample. \u03b1-SMA (I), CD163 (J), CD206 (K), and H&E (L) were stained in an ER+PR+ breast cancer tissue sample (\u00d7400; scale bar, 50\u2009\u00b5m).

Indeed, we found that high grade CAF tissues harboured higher numbers of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophages (Fig.\u00a08A\u2013D and Table\u00a02). In addition, low CAF grade was associated with lower numbers of CD163+or CD206+ macrophages (Fig.\u00a08I\u2013L, Table\u00a02).CAF-educated monocytes increased the proliferation of breast cancer cellsCAF-educated monocytes induce increased proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF or CAF cells. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. (A) Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were evaluated with MTT assay after 48\u2009hours of treatment with corresponding CMs and normalized cell numbers are shown (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, n\u2009=\u20093). (B) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in an ACEA E-plate. After a day of incubation, they were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for an additional 48\u2009hours. Cell index was measured by electrical impedance (n\u2009=\u20093). Normalized cell index (22:26:25, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) as a measure for cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells that were treated with NF- (blue) or CAF-educated (red) monocyte CMs is shown. Vertical line demonstrates the time of normalization. **p\u2009<\u20090.01. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001. ns: not significant.In order to investigate the effects of CAF-educated monocytes on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, we treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with CMs from CAF- or NF- educated monocytes. CAF-educated monocytes increased the proliferation of breast cancer cells. On the other hand, the proliferation of breast cancer cells was not significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a09A). Similar findings concerning the effects of NF- and CAF- educated monocytes on breast cancer cell proliferation were observed in real-time and label-free analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with the xCELLigence system (Fig.\u00a09B).DiscussionIt is now clear that there is a continual crosstalk not only between tumour cells and immune cells but also between stromal cells such as CAFs and immune cells. This crosstalk has an important role on development and progression of tumours. CAFs have recently been implicated in regulation of immune cell recruitment and function. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of cancer associated fibroblasts, compared with normal fibroblasts and breast cancer cells, on monocyte recruitment and polarization in breast cancer.The perspective concerning adult tissue macrophages being solely derived from bone marrow precursor cells have been recently abandoned. In fact, it has been shown that most tissue resident macrophages originated from yolk sac precursor cells. On the other hand, macrophages found in pathogen associated inflammation mostly originate from bone marrow monocytes. It has recently been show that most TAM sub-populations emerge from the Ly6C+ population of circulating mouse monocytes in grafted tumours, primary mouse mammary tumours and in lung metastases. Therefore, investigating the factors associated with monocyte recruitment to tumour tissues has utmost importance. Previous studies have shown that CAFs secrete large amounts of SDF-1. We found that CAF derived SDF-1 was crucial for monocyte recruitment, which underlines the key importance of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis for progression of several cancers. Previous studies have also shown that MCP-1 was able to induce infiltration of blood monocytes into CAF spheroids and to recruit monocytes into mammary tumours. Even though CAF-induced monocyte migration decreased with MCP-1 inhibition in our study, this decrease was not as prominent as that seen with SDF-1 inhibition. This finding demonstrated that SDF-1 is more significant in CAF-induced monocyte chemotaxis than MCP-1.Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that is upregulated on activated T cells for the induction of immune tolerance. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have been shown to be effective against several types of cancer. In a very recent study, Gordon et al. have shown that PD-1 is also expressed by both mouse and human TAMs in addition to activated T cells. They also characterized PD-1+ TAMs and showed that almost all PD-1+ TAMs express an M2-like surface profile. In light of this important study, we investigated whether CAFs might have a role in inducing such immunosuppressive PD-1+ TAMs. The role of CAFs in the induction of PD-1 expression on TAMs have not been investigated before. We found that CAF-educated monocytes demonstrated high PD-1 expression as well as CD163 and CD206 expressions. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that CAFs are able to induce a PD-1+ TAM phenotype by themselves, even without the presence of tumour cells. In addition, our findings prove that CAFs are as potent as tumour cells in terms of inducing such PD-1 expressions (Fig.\u00a03). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that PD-1+ TAMs are relevant for breast cancer in addition to colorectal cancer. In line with these findings, we suggest that CAFs may recruit monocytes and induce these recruited monocytes to differentiate into PD-1 expressing M2-like macrophages, instead of M1 macrophages. Therefore, PD-1 axis might be crucial in CAF induced immune suppression in vivo in several types of cancer including breast and colorectal tumours.In the current study, we also showed that CAF-educated monocytes exhibited increased expression of CD206 and CD163. Immune functions of CD206 (C-Type Mannose Receptor 1) has not yet been fully understood. It has been shown that the lack of CD206 results in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production during endotoxemic lung inflammation in mice and increased serum levels of inflammatory proteins, suggesting that it may have a role in the resolution of inflammation by decreasing inflammatory molecules in the blood. CAF mediated induction of higher expression of CD206, which has anti-inflammatory effects, on monocytes may also demonstrate another indirect mechanism of immune suppression by CAFs. CD163 is a haptoglobin-hemoglobin scavenger receptor and it correlates with known prognostic factors (e.g. poor differentiation (Grade 3), ER negativity and ductal type which are associated with bad prognosis). As one would expect, CAFs induced a very high CD163 expression on monocytes compared with NFs (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, we found that breast cancer cells induced high CD163 and CD206 expressions on monocytes as well as MHC class II (HLA-DR) expression; whereas CAFs did not induce HLA-DR expression on monocytes. HLA-DR is well known to be associated with M1 macrophages. The induction of HLA-DR expression on monocytes by breast cancer cells may seem controversial; however, the study by Edin et al. has shown that colorectal cancer cells induce TAMs of a \u201cmixed\u201d M1/M2 phenotype, which in turn could contribute to a \u201cgood inflammatory response\u201d. Moreover, Helm et al. have demonstrated that HLA-DR and CD163 double positive cells were detectable by immunohistochemical stainings in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues. We propose that CAF-mediated down regulation of MHC class II expression on monocytes may demonstrate a mechanism of immune escape via decreased antigen presentation, in addition to confirming the notion that CAFs are not implicated in any types of \u201cgood inflammatory response\u201d. On the other hand, it should also be noted that NF-educated monocytes expressed both CD14 and HLA-DR, which are associated with M1 macrophages, more than CAF-educated monocytes. This finding shows that activated tumour stroma may have explicit functions in terms of macrophage polarization. In line with our findings, Zhang et al. demonstrated that the number of CD68+CD163+ macrophages was higher in breast cancer tissues than in normal breast tissues.Several studies showed that TAMs promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis by releasing a variety of cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrated that CAF-educated monocytes increased breast cancer cell invasion as well as the expressions of EMT-related genes and vimentin protein significantly, while decreasing E-cadherin protein expression; in contrast to NF-educated monocytes. Our in vitro migration assay findings and gene/protein expression results display that CAF-educated monocytes enhance the motility of breast cancer cells. In a very recent study by Linde et al., CD206+ macrophages were shown to downregulate E-cadherin junctions in breast cancer cells, which may facilitate EMT. Thus, our findings support the notion that CAFs promote EMT, invasion and metastasis; via inducing M2 macrophages. We then investigated whether CAF-educated monocytes have immunosuppressive features. CAF-educated monocytes significantly suppressed T cell proliferation in contrast to control or NF-educated monocytes. CAFs were known to directly inhibit proliferation of T lymphocytes. In the current study, we showed that CAFs also exert immunosuppressive effects, indirectly, by differentiating the monocytes into M2-like TAMs.Activation status of M1/M2 macrophages in tumour tissues is transient, which gives them a functional plasticity. Our results suggest that CAFs may re-direct M1 macrophages to M2-like macrophages in the tumour tissue. The differentiation of macrophages from anti-tumoural M1-like to pro-tumoural M2-like macrophages is a crucial event in the establishment of the tumour microenvironment. Thus, investigating the factors that drive the trans-differentiation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in tumour tissues has great importance in terms of targeted therapies. We observed that CAF-educated M1 macrophages showed increased secretion of IL-10 and decreased secretion of IL-12 in addition to phenotypic changes (i.e. increased expression of M2 markers). Even though our results demonstrated that CAF-educated M1 macrophages seem to display increased expressions of both CD163 and CD206, the increase in the expression of CD206 did not reach statistical significance (Fig.\u00a07B). Given our results showing that CAF-educated monocytes show significantly increased expressions of both CD163 and CD206 (Fig.\u00a03B), CD206 expression change of CAF-educated M1 macrophages seems interesting. In fact, our studies with human breast cancer tissue samples also demonstrated that higher number of CAFs is correlated with higher numbers of not only CD163+ but also CD206+ macrophages (Table\u00a02). CD206 was reported to be more associated with M2a-like macrophages, while CD163 is prominent on the surface of M2c-like macrophages. In addition, Mantovani et al. reported that M2a macrophages are associated with TH2 type immune responses and elimination of parasites, while M2c macrophages are more implicated in immunoregulation and tissue remodelling. Therefore, CAFs may be inclined to polarize the M1 macrophages more into the M2c phenotype that is associated with immune suppression than M2a. Such a predilection seems reasonable considering tumours are known as wounds that do not heal and thus require a chronic wound healing/tissue remodelling process instead of an allergic response or killing of parasites. This might explain our results about CAF-educated M1 macrophages and our findings suggest that CAFs may be influencing M1/M2 trans-differentiation. It has been shown that IL-4, which is secreted from tumour cells and T lymphocytes, as well as colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which are secreted from tumour cells, take part in pro-tumoural differentiation of macrophages. In line with these studies, we suggest that CAFs may also prove to be important players in this re-polarization process.Since the number of \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts was found to be significantly higher in the tumour stroma compared with that in benign breast tissue and the number of TAMs was higher in tumour stroma than in tumour nest, we analysed the tumour stroma to evaluate both of these cells rather than the tumour nest. We found that the number of CD163+ TAMs significantly correlated with high tumour grade, high Ki-67 proliferation index and high tumour size. In line with such findings, CAF-educated monocytes were found to increase breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro (Fig.\u00a09). The infiltration of CD163+ TAMs seemed to be the highest in triple negative, and the lowest in ER+PR+ breast cancer samples (Fig.\u00a08), although such findings were not statistically significant.The copresence of CAFs and TAMs inside a tumour was considered to be a potential prognostic feature in colorectal cancer patients. In the current study, we showed that there exists a significant correlation between the number of TAMs and the CAF grade in breast cancer. It was recently reported that CAF-derived Chitinase 3-like 1, which is implicated in inflammatory disorders, contributed to tumour growth in breast cancer and this contribution is accompanied by a high infiltration of M2-polarized macrophages and TH2 type immune responses. Therefore, our finding of increased infiltration of breast tumour tissues with TAMs might be a direct result of the presence of high number of CAFs in those tumours; since we also demonstrated that CAFs recruit monocytes and induce M2 type polarization.In this study, we examined the relationship between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and monocytes/macrophages in breast cancer using human ex vivo cellular systems and tissues samples obtained from breast cancer patients as well as in vitro cell lines. Even though our studies were not performed using in vivo systems, our results demonstrate that CAFs promote monocyte migration and enhance their differentiation to M2-like macrophages; based on phenotype, cytokine and functional features. In addition, our studies with human breast cancer patient tissue microarrays (TMAs) showed some translational promise. Future in vivo experiments will shed further light on such new mechanistic insights and provide broader implications, as such systems would simulate all the elements of the tumour microenvironment, as well as demonstrating the effects of cell-to-cell contact in addition to the cross-talk mediated via soluble factors demonstrated in our study. Accordingly, in vivo experiments in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice can be used to prove that human monocytes co-injected s.c. with tumour cells acquire a stronger protumoural effect if preconditioned with CAFs in contrast to NFs.Materials and MethodsIsolation of fibroblasts from normal and cancerous breast tissueNormal breast tissues were obtained from 3 patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty and breast cancer tissues were obtained from 4 patients undergoing therapeutic mastectomy. All fibroblasts were isolated using a previously described protocol that utilizes Collagenase I (1\u2009mg/mL) and Hyaluronidase (125 U/mL) enzymes followed by differential sedimentation and plating. Enzymatically digested tissues were then cultured in high serum media conditions which select for fibroblast growth (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium [DMEM] supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum at 37\u2009C, 5% CO2). All human breast tissues for all of the experiments were obtained in accordance with the laws and institutional guidelines, as approved by the institutional review board of Hacettepe University (Approval numbers: GO 16/64 - 20 and GO 17/380 - 31). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.Characterization of fibroblasts with immunocytochemistryCharacterizations of fibroblasts were performed by immunocytochemistry stainings with vimentin, pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-SMA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells (7\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/300\u2009\u00b5L in each well) were cultured in eight well chamber slides and immunocytochemical / morphological analyses were performed when the cells reached a surface confluency of >80%. A biotin/streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase detection system was utilized and binding of the antibody was demonstrated with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. The images were captured by Olympus BX50 microscope.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM)CMs were obtained from CAFs, NFs and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. When the aforementioned cells reached to a confluency of >80%, they were serum starved. After 48\u2009h, CMs were collected from cell supernatants and clarified by centrifugation.Isolation and culture of peripheral CD14+ monocytesPBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers\u2019 peripheral blood using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077. Separation of CD14+ monocytes from PBMCs was accomplished by using a magnetic bead based positive selection protocol with a purity of >95%. CD14+ monocytes were cultured alone as control monocytes or with CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (CM:RPMI, 1:1) for 7-days.Phenotypical analyses with flow cytometryCD14+ PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured with CMs from NFs, CAFs, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as well as in standard medium for 7 days, then analysed using flow cytometry. M1 macrophages were cultured with CMs from CAFs or MDA-MB-231 cells for 48\u2009hours, then analysed by flow cytometry.Cultured monocytes or macrophages were detached using Accutase cell detachment solution, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were stained with antibodies against CD206, CD163, HLA-DR, CD14, and PD-1. All antibodies were conjugated to Phycoerythrin (PE) or Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Respective isotype-matched antibody controls were used as negative controls.Isolation of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cellsPBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers\u2019 peripheral blood using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077. Separation of CD4+ T-cells from PBMCs was accomplished by using a magnetic bead based negative selection protocol with a purity of >95%. CD4+ T-cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 2.1 mM L-glutamine, 100\u2009U/mL penicillin and 100\u2009mg/mL streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2.CFSE proliferation assaysIn order to assess the effects of CAF-, NF- and MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes on CD4+ T lymphocytes, we performed functional analyses with flow cytometry. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelled CD4+ T-cells were activated by CD3/CD28 magnetic beads (except the negative control group). Activated T-cells were cultured with either control monocytes or with monocytes that had been cultured with CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 cells for 7 days. After 96\u2009hours, proliferation of CFSE labelled CD4+ T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry.Evaluation of cell migrationIn order to evaluate the effects of CAFs, NFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells on monocyte recruitment, we performed in vitro migration assays. Monocyte cells were seeded into the upper compartment in serum-free medium (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 200\u2009\u00b5l). The 5\u2009\u00b5m Transwell chambers were placed into 24-well culture wells containing CMs from CAFs, NFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells. After 5\u2009h incubation, non-migrated cells were removed by cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted in five different fields of polycarbonate filter under a microscope (magnification x100).Evaluation of EMT-related protein expressions by Western BlotMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured for 24\u2009hours prior to CM treatments. The cells were then treated with CMs from NF-, CAF-, MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes or from control monocytes for 48\u2009hours. At the end of this period, cells were lysed in RIPA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). E-cadherin (primary antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; #3195) and vimentin (primary antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 5741) protein expressions in samples were examined by the Western blot method. GAPDH (primay antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, #5174) was used as the Western blot loading control. The membranes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL) and densitometry analyses of the protein bands were performed.Evaluation of EMT-related gene expressions by quantitative real-time PCRMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured for 24\u2009hours prior to CM treatments. The cells were then treated with CMs from NF-, CAF-, MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes or from control monocytes for 48\u2009hours. At the end of this period, RNA isolation from the cells was performed according to the Zymo Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit protocol. Complementary DNA was synthesized with Thermo Scientific RevertAid First Strand cDNA Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time qPCR was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The qPCR data were analysed using the Livak model (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct). Snail (Snail_reverse 5\u2032-CTGCTGGAAGGTAAACTCTGGA-3\u2032, Snail_forward 5\u2032-CGAGTGGTTCTTCTGCGCTA-3\u2032), Slug (Slug_reverse 5\u2032-TTCTCCCCCGTGTGAGTTCTAA-3\u2032, Slug_forward 5\u2032-CACTGCGATGCCCAGTCTA-3\u2032), and Twist (Twist_reverse 5\u2032-CCCACGCCCTGTTTCTTTGA-3\u2032, Twist_forward 5\u2032-GCCGGAGACCTAGATGTCATT-3\u2032) gene expressions were evaluated. \u03b2 -actin was used as the reference gene.Evaluation of cell invasionMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion was evaluated by using Transwell inserts in vitro. Monocytes were differentiated for 7 days using CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009h and corresponding supernatants were then collected. MDA-MB-231 cells in serum-free medium were seeded into upper compartments of Transwell inserts which were pre-coated with Matrigel (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 200\u2009\u00b5l). The lower compartment contained the aforementioned supernatants, which were obtained from monocytes. After 24\u2009hours, non-migrated cells were removed by cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted in five different fields of polycarbonate filter under a microscope (magnification x200).Induction of M1/M2 polarization of macrophagesCD14+ monocytes were cultured in medium containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (50\u2009ng/ml) for 7 days to obtain M0 macrophages. In order to acquire M1 macrophages, M0 macrophages were further cultured in medium containing interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) (100\u2009ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (10\u2009ng/ml) for 2 more days. On the other hand, M0 macrophages were further cultured in medium containing IL-4 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 2 more days in order to obtain M2 macrophages.Assessment of soluble factors by ELISAIn order to evaluate the levels of IL-12 and IL-10 cytokines in the culture supernatants of M1 and M2 macrophages, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We cultured M1 or M2 macrophages alone (as negative control) or with CMs from CAFs, or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells for 2 days. After this period, the cells were further cultured for additional 2 days in serum-free medium. Culture supernatants were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until the assays were performed.Measurement of cell proliferation by MTT assayMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation was evaluated via MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After about a day of incubation, CMs obtained from CAF- or NF-educated-monocytes were added to the wells and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferations were analysed after an additional 48\u2009hours (72\u2009hours in total) by adding 25\u2009\u03bcl MTT reagent (final concentration: 1\u2009mg/ml) in each well. 4\u2009hours after adding the MTT reagent, the precipitate was solubilized by 80\u2009\u03bcl detergent reagent. The plates were then left overnight in the dark and the absorbances were recorded at 570\u2009nm.Real-time and label-free analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with the xCELLigence systemIn order to assess the real-time effects of CAF- and NF-educated monocytes on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation, we performed functional analyses with the RTCA xCELLigence System (ACEA, San Diego, CA, USA). This system utilizes gold biosensor microelectrodes to measure electrical impedance. The background impedance of the microelectrodes were first measured with cell culture medium. Then, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were added to each well of the E-plate. After about a day of incubation, CMs obtained from CAF- or NF-educated-monocytes were added to the wells and the cell indices were measured by electrical impedance over an additional period of 48\u2009hours (72\u2009hours in total).Tissue samples and immunohistochemical stainingsA total of 50 human invasive breast cancer tissue samples were investigated. Patients who had received preoperative/adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. Clinical and pathological variables including age, tumour grade and size, lymph node involvement, Ki-67 staining as well as ER, PR and HER2 status were evaluated.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples were used for tissue microarrays (TMAs). Blocks were made utilizing a 4.0\u2009mm tissue cylinder through a histologically representative area of each donor tumour block. From each donor block, 1\u20132 cores were cut and 8 TMA blocks were prepared. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD163 (Biocare, Clone 10D6, 10\u2009min EDTA, 1:100), CD206 (Abcam, ab64693, 20\u2009min EDTA, 1:200) and \u03b1-SMA (Neomarkers, Clone 1A4, 1:1000) as well as Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) were performed on the 4-\u03bcm thick sections taken from the tissue microarrays using Leica Bond Max III Autostainer, following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Concentrations and antigen retrieval methods were optimized for each antibody using appropriate positive and negative controls.TAM and CAF grade evaluationsAll tissue microarray slides stained with anti-CD163 or anti-CD206 were analysed to identify areas with the highest levels of TAM infiltration. For each case, three hot spots in the tumour stroma (40x objective) were selected for counting TAMs. The median values of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophage numbers in stroma within the areas were used to categorize the patients into high and low grade groups. The intensity of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA positive spindle-shaped fibroblasts) was classified into 2 grades, using a modification of a method previously described: negative to scanty (low grade) or abundant (high grade) in a blinded analysis performed by 2 of the authors (K.K., and B.G.Y.).Statistical analysesThe Mann-Whitney U test, Student\u2019s t-test, chi-squared test, and Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to examine differences in continuous and categorical variables. A 5% type-I error level was used to infer statistical significance. All statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Software version 23.ConclusionsOur results propose that CAFs recruit monocytes and induce TAMs which might be suppressing the immune system via the PD-1 axis. We herein demonstrated that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration in order to increase the effectiveness of conventional therapies as well as immunotherapies against breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Betul Gok Yavuz and Gurcan Gunaydin contributed equally.Electronic supplementary materialSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1038/s41598-019-39553-z.Author ContributionsB.G.Y., G.G., M.E.G. and K.K. performed the experiments.

Although a few targeted therapies such as inhibitors of PARP or immune checkpoints are now available for advanced TNBC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care. Existing therapies for TNBC are largely ineffective due to drug resistance that eventually leads to relapse and metastasis within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Therefore, alternative treatment approaches are imperative to improve outcomes for TNBC patients. Recent evidence suggests that besides alterations in cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its interactions with cancer cells (i.e., tumor-stromal interactions) promote drug resistance and disease progression. Using the TME as a therapy target has gained momentum particularly for aggressive cancers such as TNBC that have a rich stroma and limited targeted therapies.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant stromal cells in the TME of TNBC. CAFs secrete paracrine signaling molecules that interact with cancer cells and promote tumor growth, drug resistance, and eventually metastasis. Recognizing the role of stroma-derived paracrine factors in tumorigenesis, several drugs are in clinical trials to target either CAFs, its secreted factors, or their corresponding receptors expressed on cancer cells. Despite progress in understanding the TME, identifying effective drugs against tumor-stromal interactions remains difficult. Typically, animal models and cell cultures are used for both mechanistic studies and testing drugs in preclinical stages. Animal models lack most, if not all, of human stroma and are incompatible with screening multiple compounds and dosing regimens needed in drug discovery. Monolayer cell cultures allow high throughput compound screening but lack the native architecture and components of tumor stroma and poorly predict drug responses in vivo. To address this technological gap, three-dimensional (3D) tumor models have been developed to recreate tumor-stromal interactions, including co-culture spheroids of cancer-stromal cells with or without ECM and microfluidic devices with tumor and stromal compartments. These models either do not recreate the spatial distribution of different components of the TME or are incompatible with automated platforms for drug screening. Emerging organoid technologies partially address these shortcomings, with major caveats that include the long time needed to develop them and challenges to incorporate stromal cells.We recently developed a 3D organotypic TNBC model that contains key components of the breast TME, i.e., a mass of cancer cells, activated fibroblasts, and ECM, and is compatible with automated liquid handling operations. Here, we leveraged this model and established that CAFs and TNBC cells predominantly communicate via HGF-MET paracrine signaling, activating several oncogenic pathways while promoting invasiveness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells. We also found that HGF-MET signaling was highly active in a lung stromal environment and promoted colony formation by TNBC cells. We identified drug combinations that significantly blocked stroma-mediated tumorigenic activities of TNBC cells.Materials and MethodsCell cultureMDA-MB-231, SUM159, Hs 578T, MDA-MB-157, HCC1806, and BT-20 TNBC cells and WI-38 lung fibroblast cells were purchased from ATCC. MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells were transduced to stably express GFP. Three different breast fibroblast cells were used: normal human mammary fibroblasts (HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein (gift of Dr. Daniel Hayes, University of Michigan), CAFs derived from a human breast carcinoma tumor (CAF-1) and obtained from Neuromics (Cat. No. CAF06), and CAFs derived from an invasive ductal breast carcinoma tumor (CAF-2) and obtained from BioIVT (Cat. No. HPCCAFBR-05). CAFs were cultured as recommended by the vendors for up to five passages. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, Hs 578T, and HMF cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). HCC1806 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. SUM159 cells were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma), 2 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic. WI-38 cells were cultured in Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. Cells were plated in T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and kept in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cell lines were tested frequently for mycoplasma contamination by PCR. No further authentication was performed for ATCC cell lines. After about 25 passages, the cells were replenished with fresh cultures from frozen stocks.Human phospho-RTK arrayA human phospho-RTK array (R&D Systems, Cat. No. ARY001B) was used to detect relative phosphorylation of 49 different RTKs on TNBC cells post-stimulation with conditioned media of CAF cells. TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and SUM159) were stimulated for 10 min with conditioned media from confluent cultures of CAFs (CAF-1 and CAF-2). For a negative control, TNBC cells were incubated with culture medium only for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed using lysis buffer 17 containing protease inhibitors (Aprotinin, Leupeptin, and Pepstatin). Protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each array was blocked for 1 h with array buffer 1 and incubated with 300 \u03bcg of protein lysate overnight at 4\u00b0C. The array was washed and incubated with HRP conjugated anti-phospho-tyrosine detection antibody and developed using FluorChem E imaging (ProteinSimple). The relative phosphorylation of each RTK in the blot array was quantified by measuring pixel densities of the corresponding pair of dots on the array in ImageJ and normalized with respect to its vehicle control.Bead-based multiplex immunoassayConditioned media from confluent monolayer cultures of HMF, CAF-1, CAF-2, and WI-38 cells were collected from an overnight incubation. Concentrations of secreted factors were quantified using a magnetic bead panel (Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. HAGP1MAG-12K) for HGF, FGF-1, FGF-2 and another panel (Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. HCYTA-60K) for EGF and PDGF-AB/BB. Briefly, each conditioned medium was centrifuged to remove debris. Then, the supernatant was incubated with the premixed antibody-immobilized beads overnight at 4\u00b0C on a titer plate shaker. The beads were washed carefully three times with a wash buffer using a handheld magnet (Millipore, Cat. No. 40-285) to retain the magnetic beads in the well plate. Next, the beads were incubated with a detection antibody followed by addition of streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Median fluorescent intensity (MFI) from the beads was measured using a Luminex MAGPIX instrument. Standard curves were generated to determine concentrations of the soluble factors.Organotypic tumor model and imaging of TNBC cell invasionThe organotypic tumor model was formed in two robotic micropatterning steps using an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) technology with 5.0%(w/v) polyethylene glycol and 6.4%(w/v) dextran. First, 7.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells were microprinted in a nanodrop to form a spheroid in each well of a 384-well plate. Then, a drop containing 20 \u03bcl ice-cold rat tail type I collagen solution (Corning) and 1.5\u00d7104 suspended fibroblasts was dispensed into each well. The 384-well plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to form the tumor model with fibroblasts dispersed in a collagen gel containing a mass of TNBC cells. For confocal imaging, the tumor models were formed in a glass bottom 384-well plate (MatTek, Cat. No. PBK384G). Images were captured with a 10X objective on days 1 and 5 of culture (Nikon A1). TNBC cells without GFP were stained with Calcein AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Z-projected images were constructed from images of samples acquired with a z-spacing of 20 \u03bcm. NIS software was used for image acquisition and Fiji (ImageJ, NIH) was used for image analysis and 3D reconstruction. The total pixel area of TNBC cells when cultured with CAF-1 or CAF-2 was normalized to the pixel area of TNBC cells when cultured with HMF. Unlabeled collagen fibers were imaged using confocal reflectance microscopy.Flow cytometryTo quantify the proliferation of TNBC cells in organotypic models 5 days after formation, the collagen matrix was digested using collagenase I (Sigma) and mechanical agitation for 15 min. Collagenase activity was neutralized by adding triple amounts of complete growth medium. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet, which was suspended in 300 \u03bcl of medium and then 50 \u03bcl of suspension of counting beads (CountBright, Invitrogen) was added. Cells were analyzed with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer. At least 103 counting bead events were acquired while running each sample. Non-fluorescing TNBC cells were used to remove the background fluorescence. The GFP+ TNBC cells were gated from unstained fibroblasts. The absolute TNBC cell number was obtained as (number of TNBC events/number of bead events) \u00d7 number of beads.Quantitative PCRCells were harvested from organotypic cultures and lysed using a Total RNA Kit lysis buffer (Omega BioTek). The lysate was passed through homogenizer mini columns (Omega BioTek). Total RNA was obtained using an RNA isolation kit (Omega BioTek). After removing DNA using RNase-free DNase (Omega BioTek), purity and concentration of isolated RNA were assessed using optical density (OD) 260/280 spectrophotometry (Synergy H1M, BioTek Instruments). cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA using random hexamer primers (Roche). Real-time qPCR was performed in a LightCycler 480 instrument II using a SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche). After combining 50 ng of cDNA with the primer and the SYBR Green Master Mix to a final volume of 15 \u03bcl, the reactions were incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of amplification, that is, at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, at 60\u00b0C for 10 s, and at 72\u00b0C for 10 s. The primer sequences for the genes are listed in Table S1. Gene expression values were calculated relative to \u03b2-actin and GAPDH using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. mRNA fold change was determined from the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.Western blottingOrganotypic cultures were treated with collagenase I for 15 min with added mechanical agitation. The collagenase activity was neutralized using triple amounts of complete growth media. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet. The cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer containing 1% protease inhibitors and 1% phosphatase inhibitors. For stimulation experiments, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells were stimulated for 10 min with CAF-1 and CAF-2 conditioned media with or without crizotinib (0.5 \u03bcM or 1 \u03bcM). For negative control, TNBC cells were incubated with culture medium only for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested using RIPA buffer. The cell suspension was further sonicated twice at a 20% amplitude for 5 sec (Vibra-Cell, Sonics). A BCA protein quantification assay was used to measure total protein concentration from each sample, which was then loaded onto a 4-15% gel (Bio-rad) for electrophoresis. Each gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk prepared in wash buffer for 1 h, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies: phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Cat. No. 9101), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Cat. No. 9102), phospho-Akt (Ser473, Cat. No. 4060), Akt (pan, Cat. No. 4691), phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705, Cat. No. 9145), Stat3 (Cat. No. 4904), E-Cadherin (Cat. No.14472), N-Cadherin (Cat. No. 13116), Vimentin (Cat. No. 5741), phospho-Met (Tr1234/1235, Cat. No. 3077), Met (Cat. No. 8198), and GAPDH (Cat. No. 5174), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The membranes were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Detection was done using ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) with FluorChem E system.Drug treatments of TNBC spheroidsInhibitors of MAPK (trametinib, ulixertinib, SCH772984) and PI3K/Akt (dactolisib, apitolisib, VS-5584) were purchased from Selleckchem. Dactolisib was dissolved in dimethylformamide and all other compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The compounds were used at 1\u00d710\u22124 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22123 \u03bcM, 5\u00d710\u22123 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22122 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22121 \u03bcM, 1\u00d7100 \u03bcM, and 1\u00d7101 \u03bcM against free floating spheroids of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells. Untreated spheroids were kept in culture media. After 4 days of drug treatments, the GFP signal from TNBC cells was measured using a plate reader and the fluorescent signal was normalized to that from the vehicle control spheroids to construct dose\u2013response curves (GraphPad Prism) and calculate LD50 values.Cyclic treatment regimenTo model resistance of cancer cells to monotherapies, MDA-MB-231:CAF-1 co-culture spheroids at a 1:1 ratio were cyclically treated with 5 nM (i.e., 0.5\u00d7LD50) trametinib for 28 days. Each experiment included four cycles of treatment (T1, T2, T3, T4) each followed by a recovery phase (R1, R2, R3). Phase images were captured at the end of each cycle to approximate the volume of spheroids. The GFP signal from TNBC cells was normalized to that from day 0 to calculate a percent viability. A growth rate metric (kc), defined as the difference in the volumes of spheroids after and before each treatment divided by 4 days treatment, was used to quantify trametinib resistance.Combination treatments of organotypic culturesOrganotypic cultures were treated with crizotinib/trametinib or crizotinib/dactolisib combinations prepared in culture medium with 1% FBS. Each inhibitor was used at five concentrations, 0.1 \u2013 50 nM for trametinib and dactolisib, and 1 \u2013 5 \u03bcM for crizotinib, which were selected based on dose-responses of free-floating spheroids of the cells. Single-agent treatments with trametinib and dactolisib were also carried out, resulting in a 6\u00d76 matrix of concentration pairs, each with four replicates. Treatments were renewed after 72 h. Confocal images of the cultures were captured on day 5. The area occupied by TNBC cells was measured, normalized with the respective vehicle control, and represented as an invasion area to quantify the effect of each treatment. The fraction of cells affected by each treatment was calculated as 1-invasion area. A synergy analysis was performed to generate a combination index (CI) for pairs of drugs.Colony formation assay and immunofluorescence imaging of proliferative cellsTNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM159, Hs 578T), with or without WI-38 lung fibroblast cells, were seeded as a single cell suspension in a 1.2% (w/v) methylcellulose (Sigma) gel made using 1% FBS-containing medium. A 1:4 ratio of TNBC:WI-38 cells was used and each well of a 384-well plate contained 50 TNBC cells and 200 WI-38 cells. Culture medium with 1% FBS was replaced every 3 days. The cultures were treated with 0.5 \u03bcM crizotinib and maintained for 8-10 days to image the colonies. The TNBC cells without GFP were stained with Calcein AM prior to imaging at a 2.5X magnification. An in-house python code in ImageJ was used to automatically detect the colonies in each image and compute their areas. A threshold colony diameter of 75 \u03bcm was used for statistical analysis. The TNBC colonies were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 3% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were incubated overnight with a Ki-67 rabbit antibody in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (Cell Signaling, Cat. No. 9027). Samples were washed and incubated with a rhodamine red donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100, Cat. No. 711-295-152) for 1h and imaged. Ki-67+ cells were counted per TNBC colony and Ki-67/colony area ratios were normalized to the average in the respective vehicle control group, i.e., TNBC cells without WI-38 cells and crizotinib treatment.Bioinformatics analysis of data from breast cancer patientsThe mRNA expression data from 2509 publicly available cases of invasive breast carcinoma were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, METABRIC dataset), using cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/). A query was performed to analyze co-expression of EGFR and MET genes. Co-expression of EGFR and MET proteins was also analyzed using protein expression data from the Firehose legacy breast cancer dataset (TCGA). The activities of p-EGFR and p-MET were determined from The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) available through MD Anderson Cancer Center.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)Gene expression data of GSE138139 was downloaded from the GEO database. For GSEA, the number of permutations was set to 1,000. The platform of this dataset is the GPL1261 Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. The enrichment score was calculated according to metastasis status (lung metastasis versus parental breast cancer cells). Differences of a nominal p<0.05 and an FDR less than 25% defined significance.Statistical analysisData were first checked for normality using the Anderson-Darling method in MINITAB. For normally-distributed data, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparisons was used to compare means among three or more samples. A two-tailed, unpaired t-test was used to compare two experimental groups. Normally-distributed data from experiments were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Non-Gaussian distributed data were analyzed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Values of p<0.05 denoted statistical significance.Data availabilityThe data generated in this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Data file.

While both TNBC cells had high basal EGFR activity, stimulation with CAFs significantly activated MET. CAF-1 led to 25 and 30-fold increase in pMET levels and marginally affected pEGFR by 0.7 and 1.5-fold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, respectively (Fig. 1b). CAF-2 also increased pMET by 3.7 and 5.5-fold and minimally changed pEGFR by 0.8 and 1.3-fold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, respectively. Thus, CAFs predominantly activated MET in TNBC cells. To further validate this finding, we treated six different TNBC cells with conditioned media from the CAFs and found significant activation of MET in all six TNBC cells by CAF-1 and in five of the TNBC cells by CAF-2 (Fig. 1c\u2013d). Despite MET protein expression in the TNBC cells (i.e., high t-MET levels), paracrine signaling with CAFs activated it (i.e., p-MET) (Fig. 1c). We ensured that MET activation was indeed due to paracrine signaling with CAFs using an immunoassay that showed both CAFs secrete high levels of the MET ligand, HGF, i.e., ~10.2 ng/ml by CAF-1 and ~1 ng/ml by CAF-2 (Fig. 1e). In contrast, HMFs secreted only 50 pg/ml of HGF. Other soluble factors such as EGF, FGF-1 and FGF-2, and PDGF AA/AB were not detectable. Taken together, these results indicate that CAFs from patients secrete HGF and predominantly activate MET in TNBC cells.CAFs activate multiple oncogenic pathways in TNBC cellsActive RTKs regulate various signaling pathways that drive breast cancer progression. We evaluated activities of several prominent pathways in breast cancers including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT. While MDA-MB-231 cells had basal MAPK/ERK activity due to an activating mutation in K-Ras, CAF-1 led to activation of both Akt and STAT3, whereas CAF-2 only activated Akt (Fig. 2a). In SUM159 cells that had basal PI3K/Akt pathway activity due to a mutation in PI3K, both CAFs activated ERK and STAT3 signaling (Fig. 2a). CAF-1 had a greater effect in activation of these pathways than CAF-2 because of its higher HGF production that led to significantly higher MET activation in TNBC cells (Fig. 1c\u2013d). To validate the role of HGF-MET signaling in activating these pathways, we used a MET inhibitor, crizotinib, against TNBC cells stimulated with CAF-1. We selected only CAF-1 for this experiment because of its greater effect on promoting oncogenic signaling in TNBC cells. This treatment led to a dose-dependent significant reduction in activation of ERK, Akt, and STAT3 in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Fig. 2b). Overall, these results established that CAFs promote several downstream pathways in TNBC cells through HGF-MET signaling.MET expression and activity in patient tumorsTo determine the clinical relevance of MET in TNBC, we analyzed MET gene expression in different breast cancer subtypes in TCGA. Basal and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer, which primarily represent TNBC, showed significantly higher expression of MET than other subtypes (Fig. 3a). We also found a moderate, but significant correlation between MET and EGFR at both gene and protein levels (Fig. 3b). To determine functional activities of MET and EGFR in breast tumors, we analyzed data for invasive breast carcinomas and found a significant correlation between p-MET and p-EGFR (Fig. 3c). This analysis of data from patient tumors underlines the significance of MET activity in TNBC, and together with our results, suggests a critical role for CAFs to predominantly activate MET in EGFR+ TNBC cells.CAFs promote pro-metastatic functions in TNBC cellsOur organotypic tumor 3D model mimics the architecture and positioning of cancer and stromal cells in solid tumors. The model has a matrix stiffness of ~2.5 kPa as in human breast tumors (Fig. 4a). Using this model, we studied the role of CAFs on matrix invasion of TNBC cells. We found that unlike HMF cells, CAF-1 and CAF-2 promoted ECM invasion of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells by up to ~2.5-fold (Fig. 4b\u2013c). Furthermore, our analysis of organotypic models showed that both CAFs promoted proliferation of the TNBC cells by up to ~1.3-fold within 5 days (Fig. 4d\u2013e).Due to the role of EMT in local invasion of cancer cells and metastasis, we investigated whether CAFs promote an EMT phenotype in TNBC cells. Invading TNBC cells in organotypic models containing CAF-1 or CAF-2 displayed a significantly more elongated morphology compared to those with HMF cells (Fig. 5a). To validate this result, we quantified gene expression of several EMT transcription factors. Co-cultures with CAF-1 and CAF-2 upregulated most EMT markers in TNBC cells (Fig. 5b). CAF-1 enhanced expression of SLUG and FOXC2 in MDA-MB-231 cells and SNAIL and ZEB2 in SUM159 cells by more than 3-fold. CAF-2 also increased expression of SLUG and FOXC2 by nearly or more than 2-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells and SNAIL in SUM159 cells by over 2-fold. We further validated these results and showed that stimulation with CAF-1 conditioned medium led to elevation of vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and N-cadherin in SUM159 cells (Fig. 5c). CAF-2 cells did not induce a detectable change in these proteins in the TNBC cells. Overall, these results indicate that CAFs shift these mesenchymal-like TNBC cells further toward a mesenchymal phenotype.Modeling resistance of TNBC cells to single-agent treatmentsFrequent emergence of drug resistance to monotherapies in solid tumors typically necessitates combination therapies to increase treatment efficacy and durability. Next, we asked to what extent single-agent targeting of constitutively-active oncogenic pathways in TNBC cells would lead to drug resistance and a potential function of HGF-cMET signaling in drug resistance. To select drug compounds for these experiments, we used TNBC spheroids and performed a dose-dependent screening of a set of molecular inhibitors against MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Fig. S2). Our quantitative analysis showed that the most effective inhibitors were trametinib against MDA-MB-231 cells with an LD50 of 10 nM and dactolisib against SUM159 cells with an LD50 of 1 \u03bcM. Then, we treated MDA-MB-231:CAF-1 co-culture spheroids with trametinib in a cyclic regimen to mimic intermittent chemotherapy cycles (Fig. 6a). Trametinib reduced the size of spheroids during the first two treatment rounds (T1 and T2) (Fig. 6b) and reduced cancer cell viability to 41% at the end of T2 (Fig. 6c). However, after the second recovery round (R2), trametinib became significantly less effective. At the end of the 28-day regimen, spheroids treated with trametinib were 3.04-fold larger than those after T1 and the GFP fluorescence intensity of the MDA-MB-231 cells, i.e., an approximate measure of number of cells, increased by 3.11-fold compared to that after T1. We used a growth rate metric (kc) to quantify the treatment effect (Fig. 6d). Although kc for the spheroids reduced during T1 and T2, it significantly increased during T3 and T4. The kc values of spheroids from T1 to T4 increased from \u22120.0059 mm3/day to 0.0172 mm3/day. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we evaluated activation of ERK, Akt, and MET following T1 and T3 treatments (Fig. 6e). Trametinib treatment reduced pERK and pMET levels but upregulated pAKT during T1. Following T3, there was significant activation of ERK and MET and persistent activity of Akt. These findings suggest feedback signaling between PI3K/Akt and MAPK/MEK pathways and gain of MET activity to drive ERK signaling as potential mechanisms of trametinib resistance of TNBC cells.Combination treatments to suppress tumorigenic activities of TNBC cellsNext, we evaluated the feasibility of a combination treatment strategy to simultaneously suppress proliferation, invasion, and EMT of TNBC cells in organotypic cultures. Because HGF from CAFs activated MET in TNBC cells, we hypothesized that treatments blocking the HGF-MET axis and its downstream pathways could potentially inhibit tumorigenic activities of TNBC cells. To test this hypothesis, we selected a combination of inhibitors of MET and MAPK pathway for MDA-MB-231 cells and MET and PI3K/Akt pathway for SUM159 cells and performed matrix-style combination treatments. This selection reflects different constitutively active kinase pathways in the TNBC cells, i.e., MAPK pathway in MDA-MB-231 and PI3K/Akt pathway in SUM159 cells (Fig. 2a). We used CAF-1 for these experiments because it had a greater effect on promoting invasion, proliferation, EMT, and oncogenic signaling in TNBC cells than CAF-2.Representative images of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells in organotypic cultures under single-agent and combination treatments and the quantified inhibition of invasion are shown in Fig. 7a\u2013d. While each compound alone reduced cancer cell invasion, the combination treatments more effectively inhibited invasion at low concentrations. With the organotypic cultures of MDA-MB-231, trametinib/crizotinib up to and including the 5 nM/1 \u03bcM pair showed significantly greater effects than the individual drugs. The 5 nM/1 \u03bcM pair synergistically reduced cell invasion by 93% and resulted in CI=0.34. With the organotypic cultures of SUM159, crizotinib/dactolisib up to and including the 1 \u03bcM/1 \u03bcM pair were more effective than each compound alone with the combination blocking SUM159 cell invasion by up to 96% with a CI = 0.39. Although the drug combinations also reduced MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cell proliferation in organotypic models by 1.76-fold and 2.0-fold (Fig 7e\u2013f), respectively, results suggest that TNBC proliferation was primarily driven by the constitutive pathway in each TNBC cell line because reduction in proliferation was mainly realized using the respective inhibitor of each pathway rather than crizotinib.Next, we studied inhibitory effects of the treatments on downstream signaling pathways. The crizotinib/trametinib pair downregulated activities of MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly greater than those from the respective responses when each compound was used alone (Fig. 7g). Additionally, it significantly reduced expression of various EMT gene and protein markers (Fig. 7h\u2013i). With SUM159 organotypic cultures, the dactolisib/crizotinib pair also significantly reduced activities of the three signaling pathways (Fig. 7j) and EMT markers (Fig. 7k\u2013l). Overall, these results provide compelling evidence that the selected combinations treatments effectively block CAFs-mediated pro-metastatic activities of TNBC cells by simultaneously blocking signaling activities in multiple prominent oncogenic pathways.HGF-MET pathway promotes TNBC survival and colony formation in lung stromaDue to the prevalence of TNBC metastasis to lung, we asked whether HGF-MET pathway has a role in supporting TNBC cell survival and colony formation in the lung. We used a Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection and derived 14 MET signature genes based on their association with activated MET. Our analysis of results from a study of a murine metastasis model of human TNBC showed that these genes were significantly enriched in lung metastasis (Fig. S3a). This was consistent with other studies that showed lung stromal cells secrete high levels of HGF. To investigate functional effects of HGF-MET signaling in lung stroma, we used WI-38 lung fibroblast cells to determine to what extent they impact colony formation of TNBC cells. First, we validated that WI-38 cells activate MET receptors in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells (Fig. S3b). We ensured the specificity of this activity by analyzing the secretome of WI-38 cells and found that these cells secrete ~7.2 ng/ml of HGF (Fig. S3c).To study the role of lung fibroblasts in survival and proliferation of TNBC cells, we developed a 3D lung stromal environment consisting of a methylcellulose hydrogel and dispersed WI-38 cells. The hydrogel also contained single TNBC cells to represent metastatic cells. We used four different TNBC cell lines at a 1:4 ratio to WI-38 cells to mimic the relatively small population of cancer cells compared to the resident stromal cells in metastatic sites. Results showed that WI-38 cells significantly promote colony formation of SUM159, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-157 cells by 1.61, 4.0, and 3.0-fold, respectively (Fig. S3d). We validated that this response was indeed due to the HGF-MET pathway by showing that crizotinib significantly reduced colony formation of all three TNBC cells (Fig. S3d). Immunofluorescent staining of the cultures also showed a significant increase in Ki-67+ TNBC cells, which was reversed by blocking the HGF-MET axis (Fig. S3e). We note that WI-38 cells did not increase colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells, consistent with a study that showed formation of MDA-MB-231 lung micrometastases significantly larger than our selected threshold to quantify colonies requires a much longer time than we used. Collectively, these results demonstrate that lung fibroblasts provide a permissive niche for survival and metastatic colonization of TNBC cells via the HGF-MET axis and suggest that blocking this pathway may provide benefits against both primary TNBC and lung metastasis.DiscussionTNBC is a heterogeneous disease that presents six different subtypes with significant activities of RTKs and downstream Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Although PARP and immune checkpoint inhibitors are now available for advanced TNBC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay treatment. Thus, disrupting tumor-stromal interactions may provide new targeted therapies for TNBC. We developed an organotypic tumor model to mechanistically study interactions of TNBC cells with patient-derived CAFs. Patient-derived CAFs predominantly secreted HGF, consistent with studies that showed CAFs in breast tumors produce as high as 50 ng/ml of HGF. However, CAFs from different patients showed a significant difference in HGF production due to inter-tumoral heterogeneity that is a characteristic of CAFs in breast tumors (Fig. S4). Although several reports have shown that breast cancer cells can produce HGF to activate MET in an autocrine signaling manner, we did not detect HGF in supernatants of TNBC cells. Furthermore, all six TNBC cell lines used had endogenous MET expression, in agreement with data from human breast tumors showing significantly higher MET gene expression in basal and claudin-low subtypes compared to other breast cancers (Fig. 3). Other studies have shown that MET is frequently overexpressed in malignant breast tissues and TNBC tumors, and its expression is a strong independent marker for poor prognosis in breast carcinoma. Consistent with the role of stroma in breast tumorigenicity, CAFs from patients significantly promoted proliferation, matrix invasion, and EMT of TNBC cells in our organotypic tumor model. Our analysis of RTK activities of TNBC cells showed high basal activation of EGFR, consistent with EGFR overexpression in up to 78% of TNBC tumors. But in the presence of CAFs, the HGF-MET axis was the dominant oncogenic signaling pathway. This finding highlights a potential reason for the failure of anti-EGFR monotherapies in TNBC, consistent with our results that showed EGFR inhibitors were not effective against TNBC cell invasiveness (Fig. S5a) or CAFs-mediated MET activation (Fig. S5b). However, crizotinib alone significantly reduced matrix invasion and EGFR activity of TNBC cells (Fig. S5a). These results emphasize limitations of targeting only genetic aberrations of cancer cells and the importance of tumor-stromal interactions as a therapeutic target in TNBC. Using a defined matrix in our model is a major advantage to capture effects of specific CAFs-TNBC signaling without additional stimulatory and inhibitory factors present in animal-derived matrices such as Matrigel. Selecting human collagen for our model was guided by previous finding that TNBC has a significant enrichment for collagen deposition compared with the luminal subtypes.Leveraging our 3D organotypic model that allows mechanistic studies to guide treatments, we investigated both single-agent and combination treatments against HGF-MET and its downstream pathways. As expected, single-agent inhibition of the MAPK pathway in a long-term, cyclic treatment regimen led to resistance of TNBC cells. Consistent with our finding, prior studies have shown feedback activation of oncogenic kinase pathways as a major resistance mechanism. To simultaneously suppress matrix invasion, proliferation, and EMT of TNBC cells, we designed combination treatments against both TNBC-CAFs interactions and basal active signaling in TNBC cells, i.e., crizotinib/trametinib for MDA-MB-231 cells and crizotinib/dactolisib for SUM159 cells. This strategy was critical because targeting only the TNBC-CAFs interaction or the TNBC cells proved insufficient. For example, using a MAPK inhibitor (trametinib) alone against MDA-MB-231 cells led to drug resistance (Fig. 6), whereas targeting only the CAFs-mediated MET activation using crizotinib alone reduced but did not block activities of signaling proteins in TNBC cells (Fig. 7). We note that crizotinib alone was very effective in downregulating oncogenic pathways in TNBC cells with a brief 10 min treatment, but this was reversed over a 5-day treatment, indicating that TNBC cells become resistant to monotherapy with crizotinib as well. The combination treatment successfully blocked activities of these pathways. In addition to the role of HGF-MET in primary tumor progression, this signaling promoted colony forming capability of TNBC cells in a lung stromal environment, consistent with the role of lung stromal cells in promoting metastatic colonization of cancer cells. Other studies showed that HGF significantly increased lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in mouse models. Interestingly, disrupting HGF-MET using crizotinib significantly reduced colony formation of TNBC cells in our model of lung stroma, suggesting that this pathway has therapeutic value against TNBC metastases formation in the lungs.In conclusion, we developed an organotypic 3D tumor model and demonstrated that interactions between TNBC cells and patient-derived CAFs occur predominantly through HGF-MET axis. This tumor-stromal signaling activated several oncogenic pathways and promoted pro-metastatic activities of TNBC cells and colony formation in the lung stroma. We developed a design-driven approach and showed the feasibility of targeting tumor-stromal interactions using specific drug combinations to significantly inhibit matrix invasion, proliferation, and EMT of TNBC cells in a primary tumor environment and their metastatic colonization in a lung stromal environment. Our engineered tumor model is conducive to phenotypic and mechanistic studies to identify new therapeutic opportunities against tumor-stromal interactions and develop and screen the effectiveness of various treatment combinations and regimens. We also note that CAFs also degrade and deposit ECM and change its mechanical properties. Investigating integrated effects of biochemical and mechanical inputs to facilitate cancer cell invasiveness can inform targeting of tumor-stromal interactions.Supplementary MaterialDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest: Authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesPrognostic markers in triple-negative breast cancerTargeted Therapies for Triple-Negative Breast CancerComprehensive Profiling of Poor-Risk Paired Primary and Recurrent Triple-Negative Breast Cancers Reveals Immune Phenotype ShiftsRisk of regional recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer patients: a Dutch cohort studyInfluence of tumour micro-environment heterogeneity on therapeutic responseThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerTumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretionA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsThe updated landscape of tumor microenvironment and drug repurposingModeling and predicting clinical efficacy for drugs targeting the tumor milieuThree-dimensional tumor model mimics stromal - breast cancer cells signalingA Human Organotypic Microfluidic Tumor Model Permits Investigation of the Interplay between Patient-Derived Fibroblasts and Breast Cancer CellsThree-dimensional models of breast cancer-fibroblasts interactionsA Living Biobank of Breast Cancer Organoids Captures Disease HeterogeneityOrganotypic breast tumor model elucidates dynamic remodeling of tumor microenvironmentMicrofluidic Endothelium for Studying the Intravascular Adhesion of Metastatic Breast Cancer CellsHigh Throughput, Polymeric Aqueous Two-Phase Printing of Tumor SpheroidsNanolitre liquid patterning in aqueous environments for spatially defined reagent delivery to mammalian cellsMicroprinted Stem Cell Niches Reveal Compounding Effect of Colony Size on Stromal Cells-Mediated Neural DifferentiationCyclical Treatment of Colorectal Tumor Spheroids Induces Resistance to MEK InhibitorsSynergistic Inhibition of Kinase Pathways Overcomes Resistance of Colorectal Cancer Spheroids to Cyclic Targeted TherapiesThe somatic mutation profiles of 2,433 breast cancers refine their genomic and transcriptomic landscapes (vol 7, 11479, 2016)TCPA: a resource for cancer functional proteomics dataPhytochemicals inhibit migration of triple negative breast cancer cells by targeting kinase signalingEpigenetic regulation of RTK signalingPhosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase or RAS pathway mutations in human breast cancer cell linesThe nanomechanical signature of breast cancerEMT, MET, Plasticity, and Tumor MetastasisRational Approaches for Combination Therapy Strategies Targeting the MAP Kinase Pathway in Solid TumorsThe Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark Gene Set CollectionHepatocyte growth factor produced in lung fibroblasts enhances non-small cell lung cancer cell survival and tumor progressionMetastasis-initiating cells induce and exploit a fibroblast niche to fuel malignant colonization of the lungsThe Proteomic Landscape of Triple-Negative Breast CancerIdentification of human triple-negative breast cancer subtypes and preclinical models for selection of targeted therapiesBreast Cancer Cells Induce Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts to Secrete Hepatocyte Growth Factor to Enhance Breast TumorigenesisSingle-Cell Analysis Reveals Fibroblast Clusters Linked to Immunotherapy Resistance in CancerCancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity in axillary lymph nodes drives metastases in breast cancer through complementary mechanismsCoexpression of hepatocyte growth factor and receptor (Met) in human breast carcinomaMet induces diverse mammary carcinomas in mice and is associated with human basal breast cancerExpression of scatter factor and c-met receptor in benign and malignant breast tissueExpression of c-met is a strong independent prognostic factor in breast carcinomaMet induces mammary tumors with diverse histologies and is associated with poor outcome and human basal breast cancerChemokines released by breast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in MCF7 breast cancer cellsMolecular characterization of EGFR and EGFR-downstream pathways in triple negative breast carcinomas with basal like featuresThe paradoxical functions of EGFR during breast cancer progressionHuman breast cancer invasion and aggression correlates with ECM stiffening and immune cell infiltrationMesenchymal Cancer Cell-Stroma Crosstalk Promotes Niche Activation, Epithelial Reversion, and Metastatic ColonizationTargeted expression of HGF/SF in mouse mammary epithelium leads to metastatic adenosquamous carcinomas through the activation of multiple signal transduction pathwaysApigenin inhibits HGF-promoted invasive growth and metastasis involving blocking PI3K/Akt pathway and beta 4 integrin function in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cellsCAFs interact with TNBC cells predominantly through the HGF-MET pathway.

IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

Hence, our findings provide novel evidence regarding the mechanisms through which the hypoxic tumor microenvironment may contribute to breast cancer progression and suggest further targets useful in more comprehensive therapeutic strategies.BackgroundThe triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for 10\u201320% of all breast malignancies, is characterized by the absence of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) without the amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC displays a high heterogeneity, aggressive features and poor overall survival rates. Targeted therapeutics for TNBC are currently limited and the chemotherapy still remains the mainstay of treatment, though the patients frequently develop resistance. Therefore, the identification of novel targeted therapies is an imperative challenge to substantially improve the outcome of the TNBC patients. In this context, hypoxia and related effectors, as the hypoxia-inducible factors, have been suggested as important hallmarks of TNBC. To date, hypoxia that represents one of the most common conditions encountered within the breast cancer microenvironment, has been associated with tumor progression, increased risk of metastasis and mortality. Malignant cells may adapt to hypoxia mainly through the action of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), which has been largely involved in tumor growth and vascularization, stromal cell recruitment, extracellular matrix remodeling, premetastatic niche formation, invasion and metastasis. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that an elevated expression of HIF-1\u03b1 has been associated with the aggressiveness of breast cancer and poor clinical outcomes. Likewise, the over-expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and the consequent hyperactivation of its target genes have been indicated as key drivers in the TNBC.Numerous transduction pathways, including the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are engaged by the hypoxia-mediated activation of the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling. In this regard, our previous studies have demonstrated that upon hypoxia and other stimulatory factors, the G protein estrogen receptor, namely GPER, may contribute to the action of HIF-1\u03b1 toward breast tumor growth and angiogenesis. For instance, HIF-1\u03b1 was shown to be required for the up-regulation of GPER by hypoxia and both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER triggered the up-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in breast cancer cells and main components of the tumor microenvironment, as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).The breast cancer microenvironment is characterized by an intricate functional interplay among epithelial cancer cells, the surrounding non-cancerous stromal cells (i.e. CAFs, adipocytes, endothelial, mesenchymal, innate and adaptive immune cells) and non-cellular components (i.e. blood and lymphatic vessels, extracellular matrix components). For instance, the bi-directional and intimate communication of cancer cells with CAFs has been reported to contribute to worse outcomes. In this vein, it is well acknowledged that cancer cells through various factors educate fibroblasts toward their pro-tumorigenic changes, which then characterize the stimulatory action of CAFs. Indeed, CAFs sustain the malignant properties of cancer cells synthesizing diverse extracellular matrix components (ECM), cytokines and growth factors, which in turn contribute to the metastatic cancer progression. In this scenario, the dynamic network occurring between cancer cells and CAFs relies on the production of many effectors, as diverse chemokines exerting tumor-promoting effects.The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family consists of several agonists, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and three receptor antagonists including the specific receptor antagonist IL1R1a. The IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) family is instead composed of more than 10 members, including the two main receptors namely IL-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) and the decoy receptor IL-1R type II. As it concerns IL-1\u03b2, its involvement in metastatic and angiogenic pathways toward breast cancer progression has been reported. In this regard, our and other previous studies have demonstrated that an estrogen-induced feedforward loop couples the IL-1\u03b2 induction in CAFs to the IL1R1-stimulatory action elicited in breast cancer cells. Likewise, high IL1\u03b2 levels within the breast tumor microenvironment have been associated with a high tumor grade and an invasive cancer phenotype.In the framework of the aforementioned data, here we first show that a positive correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression occurs in large cohorts of TNBC patients, as ascertained by querying public datasets. Thereafter, we provide novel mechanistic evidence on the hypoxia-prompted liaison between the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling and the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis, toward a metastatic gene expression profile of TNBC cells and the engagement of CAFs in facilitating invasive cancer features.MethodsPublicly available molecular datasetsGene expression analysis was performed using the publically available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) datasets. Data was downloaded on the 10 May 2020. The patients clinical information along with the mRNA expression data (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) reported in the Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort of the TCGA project were downloaded from UCSC Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/). The clinical information and the microarray gene expression data (Log2 transformed intensity values) of the METABRIC cohort (n. 2509) were retrieved from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/). Samples of the TCGA cohort (n. 1247) were filtered by the \u201csample type\u201d in order to obtain exclusively the tumor tissues (n. 1101). Thereafter, patients of both TCGA and METABRIC were classified on the basis of the presence or the absence of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), detected by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression and clinical information were also filtered for missing values. The final filtering resulted in 771 patients of TCGA and 1904 patients of METABRIC.Correlation and pathway enrichment analysisThe Pearson correlation coefficients (r-values) between the mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and the other genes of the TCGA (n. 20,530) dataset in TNBC cohort of patients were assessed in R Studio (version 3.6.1) using the cor.test() function and setting the method as \u201cPearson\u201d. The statistical analysis was performed by using the t-tests considering significant the coefficients obtained with p\u2009<\u20090.001. The first 250 most correlated genes were selected for the next evaluations. In particular, aiming to cluster these genes in pathways, we uploaded our list on the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation analysis website (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). We analyzed the genes selecting the functional annotation tool and the option Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, choosing the official gene symbol as \u201cselect identifier\u201d and gene list as \u201clist type\u201d in the options of the upload and selecting a limit species of \u201cHomo sapiens\u201d in the background.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the gsea() function of the phenoTest package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phenoTest.html) in R Studio. The KEGG \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway (KEGG entry\u2009=\u2009hsa04060) and \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d pathway (KEGG entry\u2009=\u2009hsa04066) were selected as the reference gene sets. We ranked the genes of the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway in accordance with the differential expression within HIF-1\u03b1 high and low (median expression value as threshold assessment) samples, and the \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d pathway genes in accordance with the differential expression within IL-1\u03b2 high and low (median expression value as threshold assessment) samples. Both analysis were performed only in the TNBC subgroup of patients, verifying if the selected sets of genes were enriched at the bottom or the top of the ranked lists. We calculated the enrichment score (ES) that reflects the degree to which a set of genes is overrepresented at the extremes (top or bottom) of the entire ranked list. The score was calculated by walking down a list of genes ranked by their correlation with the selected phenotype (high or low HIF-1\u03b1/ IL-1\u03b2 levels), increasing a running-sum statistic when a gene in that gene set is encountered (each vertical line underneath the enrichment plot) and decreasing it when a gene that isn\u2019t in the gene set is encountered. The magnitude of the increment depends on the correlation of one gene with the phenotype. In this analysis, 20,000 simulations were used (B\u2009=\u200920,000). p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant.ReagentsThe ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (used at a 300\u2009\u03bcM concentration) and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (used at a 10\u2009\u03bcM concentration) were purchased from Merck Life Science (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) and LY294,002 (LY) (both used at a 1\u2009\u03bcM concentration) were obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC that was solubilized in water. Recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 (used at a 10\u2009ng/mL concentration) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Life Technologies Italia, Monza, Italy) and solubilized in PBS with 1% BSA. The IL1R1 antagonist (IL1R1a) human recombinant protein (used at a 50\u2009ng/mL concentration) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific and solubilized in 20\u2009mM TBS, pH\u20098, with 50% glycerol. Anti-IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody (MAB601) was purchased from R&D Systems (Bio-Techne, Milano, Italy).Cell culturesThe TNBC MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells were provided by ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), used less than 6\u2009months after resuscitation, routinely tested and authenticated according to the ATCC suggestions. MDA-MB 231 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium) with phenol red, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). CAFs were isolated, cultured and characterized as previously described from 10 invasive mammary ductal carcinomas and pooled for the subsequent studies. Briefly, specimens were cut into 1\u20132\u2009mm diameter pieces, placed in a digestion solution (400\u2009IU collagenase, 100\u2009IU hyaluronidase, 10% FBS, antibiotics and antimycotics) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90\u00d7g for 2\u2009min. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485\u00d7g for 8\u2009min, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham\u2019s F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cultured at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2. CAFs were then expanded into 10-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for three population doublings within total 7 to 10\u2009days after tis-sue dissociation. Primary cell cultures of fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence with human anti-vimentin (V9; 1:500) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy; 1:250). FAP\u03b1 antibody (H-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy; 1:500) was used to assess fibroblast activation (data not shown). We used CAFs passaged for up to 10 population doublings for the experiments, to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. All cell lines were grown in a 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and switched to medium without serum and phenol red the day before treatments to be processed for immunoblot and RT-PCR assays.Gene expression studies and PCR arraysTotal RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription as previously described. The expression of selected genes was quantified by real-time PCR using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and are as follows: 5\u2032-ACCTATGACCTGCTTGGTGC-3\u2032 (HIF-1\u03b1 forward) and 5\u2032-GGCTGTGTCGACTGAGGAAA-3\u2032 (HIF-1\u03b1 reverse); 5\u2032-TTAAAGCCCGCCTGACAGA-3\u2032 (IL-1\u03b2 forward) and 5\u2032-GCGAATGACAGAGGGTTTCTTAG-3\u2032 (IL-1\u03b2 reverse); 5\u2032-TTACAGAGGGAAAACGACACCT-3\u2032 (GPER forward) and 5\u2032-GTGGGTCTTCCTCAGAAGGG-3\u2032 (GPER reverse); 5\u2032-AGTCCCTGAGCATCTACGGT-3\u2032 (COX2 forward) and 5\u2032-CATCATCAGACCAGGCACCA-3\u2032 (COX2 reverse); 5\u2032-AAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTAA-3\u2032 (ACTB forward) and 5\u2032-CACCTCCCCTGTGTGGACTT-3\u2032 (ACTB reverse). Assays were performed in triplicate and the results were normalized for actin beta (ACTB) expression and then calculated as fold induction of RNA expression.PCR arrays were performed using a TaqMan\u2122 Human Tumor Metastasis Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The amplification reaction and the results analysis were carried out using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Gene silencing experiments and plasmidsCells were transfected using X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Merck Life Science) for 24\u2009h before treatments with a control vector and a specific shRNA sequence or antisense vector for each target gene. The short hairpin (sh) RNA constructs to knock down the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and the control shRNA construct were purchased form SABioscience Corporation. Antisense vector for GPER (AsGPER), which was generated by cloning of the entire open reading frame of the receptor cDNA in the reverse orientation in pcDNA3.1 Hygro (\u2212), was a kind gift from Eric R Prossnitz (University of New Mexico Health Science Center, Albuquerque, USA). The plasmid DN/c-fos, which encodes for c-fos mutant that heterodimerizes with c-fos dimerization partners but does not allow DNA binding, was a kind gift from Dr. C. Vinson (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCells were grown in 10-cm dishes, exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h, and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Merck Life Science) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF-1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1%SDS and 0.1\u2009mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primers used to amplify a region containing a HRE site located into the GPER promoter sequence were: 5\u2032-TGCAGCACTTCAAAACAATAACC \u2212\u20093\u2032 (Fw) and 5\u2032-GGGTTTGAGTTGTTTTTCCTTTGG-3\u2032 (Rv); the primers used to amplify a region containing a HRE site located into the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence were: 5\u2032-ACAGACAGGGAGGGCTATTG-3\u2032 (Fw) and 5\u2032-GGGCAAGGAGTAGCAAACTA-3\u2032 (Rv). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation and the results were reported as fold changes respect to nonspecific IgG.Western blot analysisCells were grown in 10-cm dishes, exposed to treatments, and then lysed as previously described. Equal amounts of whole-protein extract were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Sigma-Adrich, Milan, Italy), which were probed with primary antibodies (1:1000) against HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (R&D Systems, Bio-Techne, Milano, Italy), GPER (AB137479) (Abcam, DBA, Milan, Italy), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), p-AKT1/2/3 (Ser 473)-R, AKT/1/2/3 (H-136), c-fos (E-8) and \u03b2-actin (AC-15; 1:4000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy) and then revealed using the chemiluminescent substrate for western blotting Westar Nova 2.0 (Cyanagen, Biogenerica, Catania, Italy). For nuclear extracts, cells were lysed using 300\u2009\u03bcl of cytosolic buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES pH\u20097.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA, pH\u20097.5, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (1.7\u2009mg/ml aprotinin, 1\u2009mg/ml leupeptin, 200\u2009mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200\u2009mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate and 100\u2009mmol/liter sodium fluoride). Following centrifugation (14,000\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C, 10\u2009min), the supernatant was referred to as cytoplasmic fraction and the pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in high salt buffer (20\u2009mM HEPES pH\u20097.9, 25% [v:v] glycerol, 420\u2009mM NaCl, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2\u2009mM EDTA and protease inhibitors). For the extraction of nuclear proteins, the obtained solution was vortexed thoroughly, incubated overnight with agitation and centrifugated at 14000\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Equal amounts of the collected supernatant, which represent the nuclear fraction, were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis was performed as described above. The purity of the nuclear fraction was confirmed by immunoblotting with primary antibodies against \u03b2-actin (AC-15; 1:4000) and anti-LMNB/Lamin (M-20; 1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy).Co-immunoprecipitation assayAfter exposure to treatments, cells were washed and lysed using 500\u2009\u03bcl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors (1.7\u2009mg/ml aprotinin, 1\u2009mg/ml leupeptin, 200\u2009mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200\u2009mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate and 100\u2009mmol/liter sodium fluoride). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min and protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie (Bradford) protein assay. Proteins (200\u2009\u03bcg) were then incubated for 2\u2009h with 900\u2009\u03bcl of immunoprecipitation buffer with inhibitors, 2\u2009\u03bcg of anti-c-fos or anti-GPER antibodies and 20\u2009\u03bcl of Protein A/G agarose immunoprecipitation reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C to pellet beads. Pellets were washed four times with 500\u2009\u03bcl of PBS and centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected, resuspended in 20\u2009\u03bcl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors, 2X SDS sample buffer and heated to 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Samples were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with primary antibodies. Western blot analysis and ECL detection were performed as described above.Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on a cover slip, serum deprived for 18\u2009h and then exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h. Next, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed 3 times with PBS and incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight with a primary antibody (1:250) against GPER (AB137479) (Abcam, DBA, Milan, Italy) or Phospho-Myosin Light Chain 2 (Ser19) (p-MLC) (Cell Signaling, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS, probed with alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Phalloidin stainingCells were exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h, washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10\u2009min, washed briefly with PBS, then incubated with Phalloidin-Fluorescent Conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assayThe concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 in supernatants from hypoxia-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were measured using human IL-1\u03b2 ELISA Kit (Thermo Scientific, Monza Italy), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The plates were read at 450\u2009nm on a Microplate Spectrophotometer Epoch\u2122 (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).DCFDA fluorescence measurement of ROSThe non-fluorescent 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) probe was used to evaluate intracellular ROS production. Briefly, cells were incubated with 10\u2009\u03bcM DCFDA (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, washed with PBS, and then exposed to treatments for 15\u2009min, as indicated. Cells were then washed with PBS, and the images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Conditioned mediumMDA-MB-231 cells were cultured under normal or low oxygen tension (2%) for 16\u2009h. Thereafter, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 3500\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in the appropriate experiments.Cell spreading assayCells were treated for 16\u2009h, trypsinized and seeded onto fibronectin (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) coated 96-well plate at a density of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/ml and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Phase-contrast images were captured after 15\u2009min and 60\u2009min. As previously reported, round bright cells were considered unspread, whereas spread cells were defined as those cells that had lost their phase-bright appearance and had readily distinguishable nucleus and cytoplasm and quantified by counting six randomly selected fields in each well under a phase-contrast microscope.Invasion assayTranswell 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane (Costar, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was used to evaluate in vitro cell invasion. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcL serum-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber, coated with Corning\u00ae Matrigel\u00ae Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Basement Membrane Matrix (Biogenerica, Catania, Italy) (diluted with serum-free medium at a ratio of 1:3). For invasion assays in MDA-MB-231 cells, complete medium was added to the bottom chambers in the presence of treatments where required, then cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 16\u2009h. For invasion assays in CAFs, conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 cells previously exposed to hypoxia for 16\u2009h was added to the bottom chambers in the presence of treatments, where required. Cells on the upper surface of the membrane were then removed by wiping with Q-tip, and invaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), photographed using Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and counted using the WCIF ImageJ software.Spheroid formation assayFor spheroid generation, 100\u2009\u03bcL/well of MDA-MB 231 cell suspensions (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were dispensed into 2% agar-coated 24-well plates. Three days after seeding, tumor spheroids (a single spheroid per well) were exposed to treatments and a 50% medium and treatment replenishment was performed every 2\u2009days. Images were obtained on day 20 using a conventional inverted microscope, thereafter cell number per spheroid was determined by trypsinizing three different spheroids, mixing the cell suspension with trypan blue and counting the number of viable cells. The total number of cells obtained was divided by the number of trypsinized spheroids.Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls\u2019 test to determine differences in means. The bioinformatics analyses, including t-tests, box plots and scatter plots, were performed using the R tidyverse package (https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/). p\u2009<\u20090.05 and p\u2009<\u20090.01 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpression levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are correlated in TNBCa The \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d signaling is a prominent transduction pathway associated with the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients. The top 250 genes correlated with HIF-1\u03b1 in the TCGA dataset were clustered using the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The x-axis and the y-axis indicate respectively the \u2212log10-adjusted p-value and the different KEGG pathways. The number of the genes represented in the identified pathways is plotted on the right of each bar. The genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway (listed in the pink box) were ordered by their HIF-1\u03b1 correlation coefficients (from high to low) (see Additional file 1). b GSEA confirms an enrichment of the genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway in the TNBC patients with high HIF-1\u03b1 levels, as indicated. The patients of the TCGA and METABRIC datasets were ranked in accordance with the differential HIF-1\u03b1 expression levels. c GSEA reveals an enrichment of the \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d genes in the TNBC patients with high IL-1\u03b2 expression. Patients of the TCGA and METABRIC datasets were ranked in accordance with the differential IL-1\u03b2 expression levels. Enrichment scores (ES) and relative p-values are plotteda Scatter plots depicting the correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 expression and IL-1\u03b2 levels in TNBC patients of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and the relative p-values are shown in each panel. b Box plots showing the differential IL-1\u03b2 expression levels in non-TNBC and TNBC patients, as found in the TCGA and METABRIC datasets. The number of patients and p-values are reported in each panelIt is well acknowledged that the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 acts as a molecular sensor within the hypoxic breast tumor microenvironment toward aggressive cancer features. Hence, we began our study evaluating the gene signature associated with HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients that are characterized by a poor prognosis. Exploring the TCGA cohort of TNBC patients, the 250 genes mostly correlated with HIF-1\u03b1 were first ranked by Pearson correlation coefficient. In order to investigate the biological significance of these genes, KEGG pathway analysis was then performed using DAVID. The top 250 HIF-1\u03b1 correlated genes were enriched in a set of pathways, as schematically reported in Fig.\u00a01a. The \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d transduction pathway, including IL1B, IL1A, IL1R, IL6, IL6ST, IL7R, IL1RAP, INHBA, OSMR and TGFBR2 that are strongly associated with breast cancer progression, was found significantly correlated with HIF-1\u03b1. Next, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in order to explore the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d expression profile according to the high and low HIF-1\u03b1 phenotypes of both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts of TNBC patients. It is worth noting that the genes included in the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway were found enriched in the group of patients showing high HIF-1\u03b1 levels (Fig. 1b). As IL-1\u03b2 may contribute to breast cancer development and metastasis and may regulate the migratory phenotype of TNBC cells through HIF-1\u03b1, we sought to evaluate whether IL-1\u03b2 could be involved in the activation of a hypoxia-related gene signature in TNBC patients. In this regard, we ascertained that the genes included in the \u201cHIF-1 signaling pathway\u201d of the KEGG database are significantly enriched in the TNBC cohorts displaying high IL-1\u03b2 expression of both TCGA and METABRIC datasets (Fig. 1c). Further corroborating these observations, a positive correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and HIF-1\u03b1 levels was found in the TNBC cohorts of both databases (Fig.\u00a02a). Exploring the clinical significance of IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients, we assessed that the IL-1\u03b2 expression levels are significantly higher in TNBC compared to non-TNBC in both TCGA and METABRIC datasets (Fig. 2b). Overall, the aforementioned data suggests that IL-1\u03b2 is engaged by HIF-1\u03b1 toward the development of the aggressive TNBC. GPER is involved in the up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 mediated by HIF-1\u03b1 upon hypoxiaThe HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling is involved in the expression of IL-1\u03b2 induced by hypoxia. mRNA (a) and protein (b) expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 evaluated respectively by real-time PCR and immunoblotting in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells cultured upon normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2).

Values represent the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. (*), (\u25cb) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured upon normoxia versus cells cultured upon hypoxiaOn the basis of the aforementioned findings and in order to provide novel insights on the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 by hypoxia in TNBC, we ascertained that a low oxygen tension (2% O2, thereafter mentioned as hypoxia) induces the mRNA (Fig.\u00a03a) and protein (Fig. 3b) expression of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, which are a well-recognized model system of TNBC. Upon hypoxic conditions, the mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03b1 did not display any change (Fig. 3a) whereas an increased protein expression was observed (Fig. 3b), in accordance with the known ability of hypoxia to decrease the HIF-1\u03b1 ubiquitination and degradation. Next, performing ELISA assays we determined that the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 increases in the medium of MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under hypoxia (Fig. 3c). Remarkably, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the expression of IL-1\u03b2 prompted by hypoxia, suggesting that HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in the up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxic conditions. In accordance with previous findings showing that HIF-1\u03b1 can be induced by proinflammatory stimuli including IL-1\u03b2, we ascertained that IL-1\u03b2 boosts the accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02). Worthy, these results suggest that the HIF-1\u03b1-dependent induction of IL-1\u03b2 upon hypoxic conditions may generate a feed-forward loop that further contributes to the stimulatory interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling. Reminiscing our previous data on the action of GPER in hypoxic conditions, we assessed that hypoxia triggers the up-regulation of GPER mRNA (Fig. 3e) and protein (Fig. 3f) levels in a time-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we then found that HIF-1\u03b1 is recruited to the GPER promoter region in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 3g). Moreover, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 prevented the protein induction of GPER upon a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3h), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia. Next, the hypoxia increased HIF-1\u03b1 levels were not altered by the silencing of GPER that instead abolished the induction of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 3i). Together, these findings suggest that upon hypoxia HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in the up-regulation of GPER, which then cooperates with HIF-1\u03b1 toward the regulation of IL-1\u03b2. In order to evaluate the transduction mechanism mediating the aforementioned responses, we first assessed that a short exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to hypoxia does increase the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig.\u00a04a), which are required for the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 and the subsequent transduction of the hypoxia-mediated signaling. In the aforementioned experimental condition, we next ascertained that the activation of two main transduction regulators of HIF-1\u03b1, namely ERK1/2 and Akt, is prevented in the presence of the ROS scavenger NAC (Fig. 4b). As c-fos expression is a suitable molecular sensor of both GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 transduction signaling, we also determined that the induction of c-fos protein levels observed upon a 4\u2009h exposure to hypoxia is no longer evident in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD, the PI3K inhibitor LY (Fig. 4c) and NAC (Fig. 4d). Likewise, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 protein levels upon a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxia using either NAC (Fig. 4e) or PD and LY (Fig. 4f), suggesting that the ROS activity triggers the ERK1/2/Akt/c-fos transduction signaling toward the hypoxic regulation of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 expression. In accordance with these findings, the transfection in MDA-MB-231 cells of a plasmid encoding a mutant of c-fos, namely dominant negative c-fos (DN/c-fos), abrogated the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 triggered by a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 4g). In order to evaluate whether the reduction of HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels triggered in the aforementioned experimental condition by the DN/c-fos construct is associated with the HIF-1\u03b1 proteasome-dependent degradation, the MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 16\u2009h with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Notably, the MG132 rescued the effects of the DN/c-fos construct on the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels (Fig. 4h), suggesting that c-fos is involved in the complex HIF-1\u03b1 biological regulation at the proteasomal level. By co-immunoprecipitation studies, we also found that hypoxia stimulates a direct interaction between c-fos and HIF-1\u03b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4i), indicating that the action of c-fos on HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization at least in part occurs through a physical interaction between these two factors. Considering that in our previous study the functional cooperation between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER triggered the expression of certain genes in hypoxic conditions, we first ascertained that HIF-1\u03b1 co-immunoprecipitates with GPER in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 4j). Thereafter, we evidenced the accumulation of GPER in the nuclear compartment of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia, as evidenced by both immunofluorescence (Fig. 4k) and subcellular fractionation studies (Fig. 4l). Intriguingly, by ChIP assays we then demonstrated that the exposure to hypoxia induces the recruitment of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER to a HRE site located within the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence (Fig. 4m). Overall, these data suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER may be stimulated by hypoxia toward the transcription of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Hypoxia triggers a functional cooperation among HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling toward a metastatic gene expression profile and invasive properties of TNBC cellsConsistent expression changes of metastasis-related genes are induced by hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, as evaluated by TaqMan\u2122 Human Tumor Metastasis Array. a MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured upon normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. b MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with vehicle or IL-1\u03b2 alone or in combination with IL1R1a.

(*) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured under normoxia versus cells cultured under hypoxia or cells treated with IL-1\u03b2 versus vehicle-treated cellsIn order to provide further insights into the metastatic gene expression profile triggered by hypoxia through the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis, we performed a TaqMan Gene Expression Assay, which consists of a Human Tumor Metastasis Array. In this vein, MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed for 16\u2009h either to hypoxic conditions (Fig.\u00a05a) or the recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5b), in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. Considering the genes resulting with at least a 0.25 log2 fold change upon either hypoxia respect to normoxia-exposed cells (Fig. 5a) or IL-1\u03b2 respect to vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5b), 31 and 15 metastatic genes induced respectively by hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 were identified (Fig.\u00a06a). Among the 11 genes up-regulated by either hypoxia or IL-1\u03b2 as depicted in the Venn diagram (Fig. 6a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a03), we then focused on the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and its target gene cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) considering that their strong increase was abrogated using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig.5a-b). First, we ascertained that a positive correlation does exist between IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 levels in TNBC patients of the METABRIC dataset (Fig. 6b). Thereafter, we confirmed by real-time and western blotting assays that the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a prevents the mRNA (Fig. 6c) and protein (Fig. 6d-e) expression of both IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 induced by a 16\u2009h exposure to either hypoxia or IL-1\u03b2 treatment, in accordance with previous evidence demonstrating that IL-1\u03b2 may auto-regulate its own production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the COX2 protein induction by a 16\u2009h hypoxic condition is prevented by silencing GPER (Fig. 6f), indicating that GPER is involved not only in the above described IL-1\u03b2 expression but also in the increase of COX2 upon hypoxia. The IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 system is involved in the invasive and proliferative features induced by hypoxia in MDA-MB-231 cells. a-b Cell spreading was evaluated in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with scramble or AsGPER and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) in the presence or absence of IL1R1a.

(*), (\u25cb), (\u25a1) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured under normoxia versus cells cultured under hypoxia or treated with IL-1\u03b2 versus vehicle-treated cellsA hypoxic environment may lower cell-ECM adhesion prompting cell motility and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition toward aggressive breast cancer phenotypes. Hence, we evaluated the contribution of GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 mediated signaling in the metastasis-related responses induced by the hypoxia-stimulated IL-1\u03b2 action. In this regard, we assessed that MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions exhibit a reduced spreading ability on fibronectin 60\u2009min after seeding respect to cells grown under normoxic conditions (Fig.\u00a07a-b). Notably, this effect was no longer evident silencing GPER as well as using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig. 7a-b). Results similar to those mentioned above were observed treating cells with IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 7c-d). Together, these findings suggest that both GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R axis contribute to hypoxia-decreased cancer cell spreading on the ECM protein fibronectin, according to previous data correlating the hypoxia-lowered cell-ECM adhesion to an increased invasion, intravasation and metastasis. Next, the invasive effects prompted by both hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 treatment were prevented not only by silencing GPER but also using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a, as evaluated by Transwell Matrigel invasion assays (Fig. 7e-f). Moreover, both GPER silencing and IL1R1a lessened the spheroid expansion upon hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 7g). Overall, these findings may suggest that the signaling network of both HIF-1\u03b1/GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R, may lead to an auto-regulatory loop of IL-1\u03b2 toward invasive and metastatic properties of hypoxic TNBC cells. The hypoxic regulation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling in TNBC cells promotes an invasive CAFs phenotypeThe paracrine action of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis promotes the actin-myosin contractility and the invasion of CAFs. a-b Immunoblots of IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 in CAFs exposed to conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells cultured upon normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) (a) and in CAFs treated with vehicle or IL-1\u03b2 (b), in the presence or absence of IL1R1a. c-d Phosphorylation of MLC in CAFs cultured with conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to normoxia and hypoxia (c) or IL-1\u03b2 (d), in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a.

Values represent the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. (*) p\u2009<\u20090.05On the basis of the aforementioned findings, we sought to provide mechanistic insights into the paracrine IL-1\u03b2 feedback on important components of the tumor microenvironment as CAFs. In this vein, CAFs were cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells, which were exposed to hypoxia. Interestingly, the up-regulation of both IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 protein levels occurring in CAFs upon this experimental condition (Fig.\u00a08a) was prevented either using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig. 8a) or the neutralizing IL-1\u03b2 antibody (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04). Findings similar to those above mentioned were observed in CAFs treated with IL1\u03b2 (Fig. 8b). Considering that hypoxia may stimulate breast cancer cells toward invasive features as cell motility, formation of stress fibers and matrix contraction, the CM from MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia promoted in CAFs the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) on serine-19 (pMLCS19) (Fig. 8c), which is known to be required for the coordination of the actin-myosin contractility. In accordance with these results, an increased MLC phosphorylation was evidenced in CAFs treated with IL1\u03b2 (Fig. 8d). Moreover, immunofluorescent staining of polymerized actin (F-actin) using FITC-conjugated phalloidin revealed an augmented formation of stress fibers upon exposure of CAFs to the CM from hypoxia-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8e) as well as upon treatment with IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 8d). Notable, both pMLCS19 phosphorylation and the increased formation of actin stress fibers triggered in CAFs by the CM from hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8c, e) and IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 8d, f), were abolished in the presence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. Then, we observed that the invasion of CAFs promoted by the CM from hypoxia-exposed MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8g) or by IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 8h), was no longer evident in the presence of IL1R1a. Altogether, these results show that the IL-1\u03b2 production by the hypoxic TNBC cells may trigger a paracrine feed-forward signaling that stimulates malignant features in main components of the breast tumor microenvironment as CAFs. DiscussionIn the current study we have provided novel insights regarding the hypoxia-mediated regulation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 transduction signaling in TNBC cells and patient-derived breast CAFs. First, we assessed that the genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway are both associated with HIF-1\u03b1 expression in human TNBC samples and enriched in patients showing high HIF-1\u03b1 levels. Thereafter, we found that the genes included in the \u201cHIF-1 signaling pathway\u201d are enriched in the TNBC cohort displaying high levels of IL-1\u03b2, which is a main component of the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway. Next, we ascertained that IL-1\u03b2 expression is higher in TNBC respect to non-TNBC samples and correlates with HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients. Mechanistically, we then assessed that the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling is involved in the hypoxia-regulated action of IL-1\u03b2, which triggers both a metastatic gene signature and invasive features in TNBC cells. Focusing on the functional interaction that occurs between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma, we also determined that IL-1\u03b2 secreted by hypoxic TNBC cells may promote a feed-forward loop engaging its cognate receptor IL1R1 in breast CAFs. Corroborating these findings, we determined that the conditioned medium collected from TNBC cells exposed to hypoxia stimulates in CAFs the actin polymerization and the MLC phosphorylation, which characterize the attainment of invasive phenotypes.Intratumoral hypoxia, which is a common feature in solid cancers as breast cancer, is associated with an increased risk of metastatic aggressiveness and patient mortality. Of note, cancer cells can adapt to low oxygen tension activating the hypoxia-inducible factors that mainly drive a peculiar gene expression signature. As well-known, the master regulators of the cellular adaptation to hypoxia consist of the oxygen-regulated HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1 and HIF-3\u03b1 subunits and the constitutively expressed HIF-1\u03b2 subunit. The HIF-1\u03b1, 2\u03b1 and 3\u03b1 subunits are subjected to oxygen-dependent processes like prolyl hydroxylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which are inhibited upon hypoxia that triggers the post-translational stabilization and the HIF-\u03b1 protein accumulation. Subsequently, HIF-1\u03b1 binds to the hypoxia response elements regulating the transcription of genes implicated in critical aspects of cancer biology as angiogenesis, stem cell maintenance, metabolic reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis and resistance to therapy. Likewise, hypoxia-activated HIF-1\u03b1 plays a role in the tumor-related inflammation leading to worse clinical outcomes in diverse types of cancers including breast tumors. These events may occur through the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent regulation of signaling mediators and inflammatory genes in both cancer and neighboring cells within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the pro-tumorigenic action of HIF-1\u03b1 may occur through its interaction with various signaling pathways like transforming growth factor-\u03b2, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch and GPCRs. In this regard, GPER was shown to be involved together with HIF-1\u03b1 in the cell adaptation to low oxygen tension in diverse tumors as breast cancer. In particular, hypoxia-activated HIF-1\u03b1 was found to cooperate with GPER in breast cancer cells and CAFs toward gene expression changes and relevant biological responses. Intriguingly, GPER was also shown to trigger the activation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 transduction signaling, which in turn promoted inflammatory responses and aggressive features of breast cancer cells. Further corroborating these findings, we here demonstrate that a functional liaison between HIF-\u03b1 and GPER mediates the induction of IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC cells exposed to hypoxic conditions. In particular, we first evidenced that the up-regulation of GPER upon hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to a HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in TNBC cells. Then, we assessed that in hypoxic TNBC cells HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence. It is worth mentioning that many studies have demonstrated that GPER is detectable not only at the plasma membrane level, but also in the intracellular and nuclear compartments. As it concerns the signaling cascade triggering the aforementioned findings, we demonstrated that the ROS-dependent ERK1/2 and AKT activation together with the ensuing c-fos induction contribute to the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 as well as the up-regulation of GPER and IL-1\u03b2 in hypoxic TNBC cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays also revealed that c-fos both interacts directly and protects HIF-1\u03b1 from the proteasomal degradation.As largely reported, TNBC patients show an elevated incidence of metastatic processes and low survival rates. Unfortunately, TNBCs remain to be fully characterized toward the assessment of reliable prognostic markers and drug targets. Of note, \u201comics\u201d technologies have recently provided intriguing insights into the molecular landscape and the heterogeneous clinical features of TNBC, leading to the identification of potentially actionable targets. In this scenario, the HIF-dependent signaling has been reported to be particularly active in TNBCs, suggesting that hypoxia may play a relevant role toward the peculiar features of TNBCs. Likewise, it has been ascertained that the tumor-stroma inflammation network may prompt the pro-metastatic phenotypes in TNBCs. In this regard, it should be mentioned that IL-1\u03b2 acts as an important effector of the oncogene-driven pathways linking inflammation to cancer. Indeed, IL-1\u03b2 is considered as a master cytokine in the progression of breast cancer as its production has been found correlated with advanced diseases, whereas the IL1R1 inhibition by the antagonist anakinra was shown to prevent the growth of breast cancer and the bone metastasis in mouse models. Further corroborating these data, IL-1\u03b2 was found to contribute to the hypoxia-mediated angiogenesis through the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1. In the framework of these findings, we have here provided novel evidence regarding the hypoxic-induced IL-1\u03b2 expression and function toward the metastasis-related gene profile as well as the growth and invasive properties of TNBC cells.COX2 is the key enzyme in eicosanoid biosynthesis and the master switch in the activation of the inflammatory responses. The induction of COX2 by inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, triggers the biosynthesis of prostaglandins from the arachidonic acid, which is a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid released from membrane phospholipids upon the phospholipase A2 action. Worthy, the constitutive expression of COX2 and the sustained biosynthesis of the main effector of inflammation named prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), are both linked to mammary carcinogenesis due to their stimulatory effects on mitogenesis, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis and immunosuppression. In addition, the overexpression of COX2 may occur in approximately 50% of breast cancer and has been found correlated with a reduced disease-free and overall survival and the primary tumor size. Of note, in line with our findings regarding the hypoxia-dependent activation of the IL-1\u03b2/COX2 signaling toward the stimulation of growth and invasion of TNBC cells, previous studies have shown that the MDA-MB-231 cells display a lipidomic profile characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are known to contribute to breast cancer progression, as mentioned above.In the breast cancer microenvironment, the bidirectional interplay occurring among neoplastic cells with CAFs, tumor-associated macrophages, endothelial and immune infiltrating cells, endorses tumor progression stimulating responses as cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. In particular, CAFs may facilitate the establishment of a conducive microenvironmental niche for the cruitment and maintenance of disseminated tumor initiating cells. Likewise, CAFs may regulate the malignant features fostering the proliferative, migratory and invasive potential of surrounding tumor cells. In this respect, IL-1\u03b2 was involved in the connection between breast cancer cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are considered an additional source of CAFs beyond the fibroblasts. Worthy, the IL-1\u03b2-dictated cellular interaction stimulated the production of diverse chemokines by MSCs as well as an increased motility of TNBC cells. Nicely reminiscing these observations, we have here demonstrated that hypoxic TNBC cells trigger IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 paracrine signals that prompt certain cytoskeletal changes as the MLC-driven formation of actin stress fibers toward invasive properties of breast CAFs. Overall, our data provide novel evidence regarding the mechanisms through which hypoxia triggers the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling, which generates a feed-forward stimulatory loop in both TNBC cells and CAFs. Our findings may be therefore considered in more comprehensive therapeutic strategies targeting breast cancer progression.ConclusionsOur data provide novel evidence regarding the molecular mechanisms through which the IL1\u03b2-IL1R signaling does prompt stimulatory effects upon hypoxia in TNBC cells and CAFs. Considering the intricate interplay occurring among diverse players activated by hypoxia even through feed-forward loops, further efforts are warranted to better appreciate this complex scenario toward more comprehensive therapeutic strategies halting the aggressive features of the TNBC.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsACTBActin betaCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsCOX2Cyclooxygenase 2DAVIDDatabase for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated DiscoveryECMExtracellular matrix componentsEREstrogen receptorGPCRsG protein-coupled receptorsGPERG protein estrogen receptorGSEAGene Set Enrichment AnalysisHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2HIF-1\u03b1Hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1IL-\u03b2Interleukin-1\u03b2IL1R1Interleukin 1 Receptor Type 1IL1R1aIL1R1 antagonistKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesMETABRICMolecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International ConsortiumNACN-acetyl-L-cysteinePRProgesterone receptorROSReactive oxygen speciesTCGAThe Cancer Genome AtlasTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerVEGFVascular endothelial growth factorPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Rosamaria Lappano and Marianna Talia contributed equally to this work.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s13046-020-01667-y.Authors\u2019 contributionsRL and MM conceived the study, analyzed and interpreted the data.

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively.

Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

        "content": "Paracrine activation of cells contained in the tumor microenvironment promotes tumor progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, malignant cells recruit and educate macrophages into a M2 tumor-promoting phenotype that supports the metastatic spread of cancer cells. Here, we show that miR-149 functions as a metastasis-suppressing microRNA in breast cancer cells by limiting colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1)-dependent recruitment and M2 polarization of macrophages. In lymph node-positive, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues, low miR-149 expression correlated with macrophage infiltration and reduced patient survival. By directly targeting CSF1, miR-149 expression in TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) inhibited the recruitment of human monocytic THP-1 cells and primary human macrophages. Furthermore, in macrophages cocultured with MDA-MB-231 cells expressing miR-149, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and amphiregulin expression levels were strongly reduced, resulting in reduced EGF receptor activation in the cancer cells. <iIn vivo</i, lung metastases developing from orthotopic MDA-MB-231 tumors were reduced by 75% by miR-149 expression, and this was associated with impaired M2 macrophage infiltration of the primary tumors. These data suggest that miR-149 downregulation functionally contributes to breast tumor progression by recruiting macrophages to the tumor and facilitating CSF1 and EGF receptor cross-talk between cancer cells and macrophages. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings contribute to the understanding of tumor-stroma interactions by showing that miR-149 downregulation in TNBC enhances reciprocal growth factor signaling between macrophages and cancer cells, which promotes tumor progression and metastasis.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

Even though it has been shown that CAFs support tumor growth, not much is known about how they contribute to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of breast cancer (BC).Tumor stromal cells may secrete paracrine factors, which can affect the distinct layers of the neoplastic population, resulting in phenotypic and signaling pathway alterations throughout the tumor cohort.CAFs take a crucial part in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment in BC by recruiting monocytes and affecting their polarization states.Our findings propose that exosomal transfer of miR-18a1 may be a novel mechanism underlying the paracrine effects of tumor-educated monocytes and may provide a way for exosomes to promote tumor progression within the microenvironment of BC cells.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12967-022-03780-2.BackgroundThe tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and continuously evolving entity composed of stromal cells, immune cells, and blood vessels arranged in the extracellular matrix. The reciprocal and dynamic crosstalk between the TME components and tumor cells contributes to tumorigenesis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are a prominent part of the tumor stroma, not only provide physical support for tumor cells to promote tumor growth and progression, but they also contribute to an immunosuppressive TME by affecting many immune cells. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which originate from circulating monocyte precursors, are the most abundant immune cell type in close proximity to the CAF-populated areas, indicating a close association between these two major cell populations in the stroma of tumors, where they often exert protumorigenic functions.Cancer locally educates TAMs to distinguish them from monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages. The mutual interactions with tumor cells and the stromal microenvironment contribute to the phenotypic polarization of TAMs. The M1/M2 polarization of macrophages is endowed with a repertoire of tumor-promoting capabilities involving tumor growth and metastasis, tissue remodeling, and immunosuppression. Breast cancer (BC) is characterized by having a large population of TAMs, most of which exhibit the M2 phenotype. Both CAFs and TAMs support tumor progression and an increased number of either is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. CAFs and TAMs do more than just reciprocal communication with the tumor cells; they also interact with each other in a dynamic way in the tumor milieu. Numerous studies have indicated that CAFs play a crucial role in monocyte recruitment and M2 polarization in different types of tumors, such as BC. Investigating TME-induced macrophage polarization and communication between TAMs and tumor cells is crucial for further understanding of TAM-related pro-tumor outcomes and the potential development of novel therapeutic strategies.Exosomes, a subclass of membrane-derived extracellular vesicles with a size range of 30\u2013150\u00a0nm in diameter, are produced and released by all types of cells into the extracellular milieu. Exosome-mediated transfer of functional coding and non-coding RNAs is a mechanism of genetic exchange between cells in the TME, thereby affecting tumor development and progression. However, the function of TAM-derived exosomes in the BC-immunosuppressive microenvironment remains to be clarified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are a class of non-coding, endogenous, small RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by inducing degradation or translational repression of target mRNAs. From a therapeutic intervention perspective, intercellular communications mediated by exosomal miRNAs are attracting increasing attention due to their contributions to tumor progression by reprogramming the TME.There is little known about the functional effects of the exosome-mediated transfer of miRNAs released from tumoral monocytes on BC pathogenesis. In this study, we first elucidated that CAFs obtained from invasive BC recruited monocytes and induced an M2-like pro-tumoral phenotype, promoting BC progression. Next, we aimed to shed light on the mechanism by which the exosome-mediated transfer of miR-181a secreted by CAF-educated monocytes activates AKT signaling in BC cells.Materials and methodsClinical samples and processingThe peripheral blood samples from 40 invasive breast ductal carcinoma patients who had not received any chemotherapeutic treatment before surgery were collected in the study. A cohort of 35 age-matched healthy control women with no evidence of any personal or family history of BC participated in this study. A record of the clinicopathological parameters of BC patients is summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1. To harvest the plasma samples, around 5\u00a0mL of blood samples from each participant were centrifuged at 3000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and then stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C until use. To isolate the stromal fibroblasts, primary cancer tissues were obtained from three female BC patients with histological grade III invasive ductal carcinoma who had undergone mastectomy. Normal breast tissues were obtained from three healthy women undergoing reduction mammoplasty. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tarbiat Modares University and written informed consent was obtained from the participants.Isolation, characterization, and culture of primary fibroblastsFibroblasts were isolated enzymatically from both normal and cancerous breast tissues using collagenase A as previously described and were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Immunophenotyping of patient-derived CAFs was performed for positive expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), fibroblast-activation protein (FAP), and negative expression of CD31 to exclude endothelial cell contamination using flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). To prepare the conditioned media (CM) of cancerous and normal cultured fibroblasts (CAF- and NF-CM, respectively) for monocyte treatments, stromal fibroblasts derived from tissue specimens were passaged 4\u20136 times. The expressions of CAF markers (\u03b1-SMA and FAP) and CAF-derived cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 as were also measured by western blotting over the course of passaging the cells. When fibroblasts reached a confluency of >\u200980%, the cells were serum starved. After 48\u00a0h, the CM were collected, pooled, and centrifuged at 300\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min and then further centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7g for 30\u00a0min to eliminate residual cells and cellular debris, respectively.Monocyte isolation and characterizationLow-density mononuclear cells were first separated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient. CD14+ monocytes were isolated using a magnetic bead-based positive selection system (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) with a purity of >\u200990%, as confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. CD14+ monocytes were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS alone as control monocytes or were educated with CM derived from CAFs or NFs (CM:RPMI, 1:1) for 7\u00a0days. Cultured monocytes were stained with antibodies against CD163, CD206, PD1, CD14, as well as HLA-DR and then analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences).T-cell isolation and expansionPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy individuals\u2019 peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient separation. The isolated PBMCs were then cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Subsequently, the adherent cells were removed and T-cells were isolated by nylon wool columns. T-cells were stimulated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and expanded in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 7\u201310\u00a0days.Cell culturesThe human BC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted FBS. The human monocyte cell line THP-1 was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS. All cells were cultured with 100\u00a0U/mL penicillin and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL streptomycin at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The monocytic THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by 24\u00a0h incubation with 150\u00a0nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI medium. Macrophage M2 polarization was obtained by incubation of THP-1 M0 macrophages with 20\u00a0ng/mL of interleukin (IL)-4 for 48\u00a0h.Isolation and characterization of exosomesExosomes were isolated from the supernatant of monocytes educated with the CM derived from CAFs or NFs by differential centrifugation as we previously described. Briefly, monocytes were maintained in bovine serum albumin (BSA) or serum-free medium 48\u00a0h before supernatant collection. The cell culture supernatants were collected, and centrifuged at 300\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min to eliminate residual cells and at 10,000\u00d7g for 30\u00a0min to further remove cells and debris. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter to remove any vesicles larger than 200\u00a0nm. The filtered supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000\u00d7g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. To further eliminate contaminating protein, the exosome pellet was re-suspended in PBS and centrifuged again at 100,000\u00d7g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Finally, the exosome-enriched pellets were re-suspended in PBS and stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C until use.The quantity of exosomes was expressed as exosome-associated proteins using the BCA method. Exosome-specific surface markers CD9 and CD81 were detected by western blotting as we previously described. The morphology of exosomes was observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, LEO 906 Zeiss 100\u00a0kV, Germany). The size distribution of the purified exosomes was also determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instrument, UK).Cellular uptake of purified exosomesFluorescent labeling of purified exosomes was performed using a PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with some modifications. The labeled exosomes were added to a subconfluent layer of BC cells and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h. Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. For nuclear staining, DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Sigma-Aldrich) was used. The uptake of exosomes was imaged using a spectral confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse TiE).CFSE proliferation assayTo assess the effects of CAF- or NF-educated monocytes on T lymphocyte proliferation, T-cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and were co-cultured with either control monocytes or with monocytes educated with CAFs or NFs. In parallel, T-cells were incubated with exosomes derived from NFs or CAFs. After 72\u00a0h, the proliferation of CFSE-labeled T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry and compared to the control T-cells.Transient transfectionBC cells were transiently transfected with 25\u00a0nM miR-181a mimic or negative controls (NC); miR-181a inhibitor or scramble (Sc) using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 (Invitrogen, USA). To perform a luciferase reporter assay, BC were transfected with 2\u00a0\u00b5g of the psi-CHECK2 luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). Then, luciferase-expressing BC cells were co-cultured with monocytes and were maintained in the control medium, NF-CM, or CAF-CM. After 24\u00a0h, cell lysate was collected and added into a 96-well plate. The luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA).Cell cycle analysisBC cells were transfected with miR-181a mimic, miR-181a inhibitor, or the corresponding negative controls as described above. Additionally, another group of BC cells was treated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from CAFs or NFs. After 36\u00a0h, BC cells were harvested, treated with Triton X100 and RNase A, and then stained with propidium iodide (PI, Sigma). Afterward, cell cycle distribution was analyzed via a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Cell migration assaysA confluent monolayer of serum-starved BC cells plated into a 12-well plate was subjected to a single-scratch wound by using a sterile pipette tip. The cells were incubated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from control monocytes, NEMo, or TEMo and compared to PBS-treated control cells. The cell migration distance was measured and imaged. A cell transwell assay was also performed using 24-well transwells (Corning, USA). The corresponding treated or transfected cells were seeded into the upper chambers in 100\u00a0\u00b5L of FBS-free medium. As a chemoattractant, the medium with 10% FBS was added to the bottom part of the chambers. Cells were fixed and stained using 1% crystal violet dissolved in methanol 24\u00a0h after incubation. The cells that migrated through the membrane and stuck to the lower surface of the membrane were imaged and counted.Determination of intracellular reactive oxygen species productionThe intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production levels were measured by adding the 2\u2032, 7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (ab113851, Abcam) to the cell suspension according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The fluorescent intensity was measured by flow cytometry (BD FACS Canto II, BD Bioscience) and analyzed by FlowJo Software 7.6.2.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaysQuantitative measurements of secreted IL-10 and IL-12 cytokines were performed on the culture supernatants of THP-1 M0 macrophages, M2 macrophages (serve as positive control), and NF- or CAF-educated M2 macrophages for 48\u00a0h, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All cell culture supernatants were used undiluted.In silico analysis for prediction of miR-181a candidate target genesIn order to predict the potential targets of miR-181a, we used TargetScan 8.0 (http://www.targetscan.org), miRTargetLink Human (https://ccb-web.cs.uni-saarland.de/mirtargetlink) and RNAhybrid (https://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid) online tools. The DNA Intelligent Analysis (DIANA)-miRPath v3.0 (http://diana.imis.athena-innovation.gr/DianaTools) algorithm was used to show the miRNA regulatory roles and to find the significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) molecular pathways.RNA extraction and reverse transcription quantitative PCRTotal RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation and treated with RNase-free DNase (Fermentase, Lithuania). RNA was then reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using the PrimeScript 1st strand cDNA synthesis kit (TAKARA, Japan). To quantify miRNA, a poly(A) tail was initially added to the extracted total RNA by using polyA polymerase enzyme (NEB), and cDNA was then synthesized by using an anchored oligo (dT) primer as described previously. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted on an ABI Step One Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The relative expression was normalized to U48 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and GAPDH using the 2\u2212\u0394Ct and 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct methods.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted from the cells or exosomes using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. For membrane blocking, 5% skim milk was used for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. The primary antibody incubation was performed for 12\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and then followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody incubation for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. The membranes were subjected to chemiluminescence using an ECL Kit (Amersham, UK). \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control.In vivo tumor xenograft modelAll animal experimental procedures were approved by the Committee for Animal Research of the University. A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 MDA-MB-231 BC cells alone or mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes (derived from TEMo or NEMo) were suspended in 100\u00a0\u00b5L serum-free DMEM and matrigel (1:1 ratio) and were subcutaneously injected into the oxter of 6-week old female BALB/C athymic nude mice. Tumor volume was monitored at every 7-day interval. The tumor volume was calculated using the formula: V (mm3)\u2009=\u2009(L\u2009\u00d7\u2009W2)/2. After 4\u00a0weeks, the mice were sacrificed to evaluate tumor growth.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistryFormalin-fixed tumor tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut into thin sections. The tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard procedures. For immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, tissue sections were dewaxed with xylene and then rehydrated in graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed by microwave heating in sodium citrate buffer at pH 6.0. To block endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were immersed in 3% H2O2 for 30\u00a0min. The sections were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies against \u03b1-SMA (ab7817, Abcam) and Ki-67 (sc-23900, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. After washing, the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h, and reactive products were visualized by staining with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB). The images were captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus CKX41, Japan) with appropriate magnification.Statistical analysisData are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) of at least three experiments. Statistical significance was calculated by Student\u2019s t-test when comparing two groups or by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) when comparing three or more groups. A p-value of\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsPrimary CAFs recruit monocytes and induce a pro-tumoral phenotype resembling M2 macrophagesStromal fibroblasts isolated from BC tissues exhibit characteristics of CAFs, effectively recruit monocytes and subsequently affect their polarization states. A Representative photomicrographs of H&E staining and IHC staining of \u03b1-SMA (a CAF-specific marker) and Ki67 (a proliferation marker) positive cells in breast tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues (\u00d7100). Immunohistochemically, the presence of \u03b1-SMA demonstrated the presence of stromal myofibroblasts surrounding the cancer nests, which were distributed among the invasive cancer cells in the heterogeneous cancer tissue. B A schematic illustration of primary CAF isolation and expansion in vitro. C Flow cytometry staining of primary cultured CAFs with anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-FAP, and anti-CD31. CAFs were characterized by the expression of \u03b1-SMA and FAP but lacked the expression of endothelial cell marker CD31 by flow cytometry. D, E To elucidate that monocytes are functionally recruited by CAFs, serum-starved monocytes were allowed to migrate for 12\u00a0h toward CMs from CAFs or NFs and compared to the negative control. D Representative photomicrographs of the migration potential of monocytes in different conditions assessed using the transwell assay. E Quantitative assessment of migrated cells showed that monocytes were effectively recruited by CAF-CM. Representative flow cytometry histograms (F) and bar graphs of mean fluorescent intensity (G) show that the expression levels of CD163, CD206, and PD-1 were considerably higher in TEMo than in NEMo or control monocytes, while the expression levels of HLA-DR and CD14 were significantly lower in TEMo compared to NEMo. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. *P-value\u2009<\u20090.05, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001To investigate the relationship between CAFs and the malignance phenotype, we first studied the expression of \u03b1-SMA (a myoepithelial cell marker) and Ki67 (a marker of proliferating cells) in tumor and non-tumor tissues obtained from BC patients. IHC assay performed on tissue samples confirmed that \u03b1-SMA is localized, particularly in adjacent stromal cells, which are mainly comprised of stromal myofibroblasts. Results also indicated that the expression of \u03b1-SMA has a significant association with histopathological grade (Fig.\u00a01A). As CAFs appear to be major tumor microenvironment components facilitating tumor progression, we aimed to clarify the function of CAFs isolated from patients who have been diagnosed with advanced grade tumors. To this end, CAFs were isolated from three primary BC tissues (Grade III) obtained from patients undergoing mastectomy (Fig.\u00a01B). As healthy counterparts, we used normal fibroblasts (NFs) isolated from normal breast tissues obtained from patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty. Primary cultures of both of those isolated fibroblasts were established. The evaluation of cell surface markers by flow cytometry indicated the positive expression of \u03b1-SMA and FAP but the lack of expression of vessel marker CD31 in isolated CAFs (Fig.\u00a01C). Additionally, western blot analysis revealed the expression of CAF-specific markers (\u03b1-SMA and FAP) and CAF-derived cytokines (IL-6, and TGF-\u03b2) over the course of passaging, confirming CAF activation status throughout the experiments (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).Stromal cells have been demonstrated to affect monocyte recruitment and polarization in addition to altering their functions in the TME. To evaluate whether CAFs recruit monocytes, we isolated monocytes from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and performed transwell migration assays. The bottom chambers contained conditioned media (CM) collected from CAFs and NFs, thus serving as chemoattractants. We observed that monocytes migrate toward CAF-CM in the bottom chambers, suggesting that CAFs may effectively recruit monocytes (Fig.\u00a01D, E). Additionally, to explore whether CAFs were able to induce a pro-tumoral phenotype in monocytes, CD14+ cells isolated from healthy individuals were subjected to differentiation following treatment with CAF-CM. Hereafter, monocytes educated by CM derived from tumoral CAFs are denoted as tumor-educated monocytes or TEMo, and monocytes co-cultured with CM derived from NFs are referred to as normal fibroblast-educated monocytes or NEMo. After 7\u00a0days of culture, the expression M2 macrophage markers CD163 and CD206 were higher in TEMo than in NEMo. In addition, the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was higher in TEMo than in NEMo. In fact, NF-educated cells\u2019 expressions of PD-1, CD163, and CD206 were similar to control monocytes. On the other hand, the expression of CD14 was much higher in NEMo than in TEMo. In addition, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR) expression of TEMo is much lower than that of NF-educated cells (P\u2009<\u20090.05, Fig.\u00a01F, G). All of these results suggest that CAFs may recruit monocytes and affect their polarization states.CAFs promote THP-1 polarization into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophagesCAFs induce the polarization of THP-1 cells into anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages. A After 24\u00a0h of incubation with 150\u00a0nM PMA, the monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation was confirmed by the elevated transcript levels of recognized macrophage markers CD36, CD68, and CD71. The decreased transcript level of CD14 in PMA-treated THP-1 cells further confirmed that the THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophage-like cells. B Transcript expression levels of M2 macrophage markers CD163 and CD206 in THP-1 macrophages incubated with CAF-CM were significantly increased compared with those in THP-1 M0 macrophages alone or incubated with NF-CM after 48\u00a0h. As a positive control, THP-1 macrophages were stimulated with 20\u00a0ng/mL of IL-4 for 48\u00a0h. C Protein secretion levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 were assessed by ELISA. THP-1 macrophages incubated with CAF-CM as well as positive control M2 macrophages were identified by IL-10high IL-12low phenotype when compared to THP-1 M0 macrophages alone or incubated with NF-CM, confirming the potential of CAFs in promoting the polarization of THP-1 cells into anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages after 48\u00a0h. D, E The relative levels of intracellular ROS production during macrophage polarization. The amount of ROS produced by differentiated THP-1 macrophages increased noticeably when monocytes were treated with PMA. Importantly, ROS generation in CAF-educated macrophages was lower than that in macrophages educated by NF-CM after 48\u00a0h. Even though the level of ROS diminishes during M1/M2 polarization, CAF-induced M2-like macrophages were found to produce higher levels of ROS than THP-1 control monocytes. Representative flow cytometry histograms (D) and bar graphs of relative DCFDA fluorescence intensity (E) imply that CAFs contribute to M2 polarization in part by increasing ROS production, as M2 macrophages require a level of ROS for proper polarization. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. ns: non-significant, *P-value\u2009<\u20090.05, **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001To explore the capability of CAF to induce M2 polarization of macrophages, the human monocyte cell line THP-1 was differentiated into macrophages by incubation in the presence of 150\u00a0nM PMA. After 24\u00a0h, cells became adherent and displayed an irregular cell shape characteristic of cells undergoing differentiation. As shown in Fig.\u00a02A, qRT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of recognized macrophage markers CD36, CD68, and CD71 were found to be higher as the macrophages differentiated (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The expression of CD14 was also decreased (P\u2009<\u20090.001), further confirming the monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation (Fig.\u00a02A). Afterward, THP-1 M0 macrophages were incubated with either CAF- or NF-CM and compared to positive control cells (i.e., THP-1 M0 macrophages stimulated with 20\u00a0ng/mL of IL-4 for 48\u00a0h). The M2 polarization of macrophages was assessed by studying the transcript and protein levels of several M2 macrophage markers. After 48\u00a0h of incubation, the transcript levels of CD163 (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and CD206 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) were found to be significantly increased in CAF-CM-incubated THP-1 macrophages (Fig.\u00a02B). Consistently, protein secretion level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased in culture supernatants of CAF-educated macrophages (P\u2009<\u20090.001), whereas protein secretion level of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 was found to be decreased in macrophages incubated with CAF-CM (P\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a02C). These findings shed light on the potential of CAFs in promoting THP-1 polarization into anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages.Additionally, as it was demonstrated that oxidative stress plays a role in modulating macrophage phenotype, we aimed to determine ROS status during macrophage polarization. Data showed that when monocytes were incubated with PMA, ROS production in differentiated THP-1 macrophages was markedly elevated (P\u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a02D, E). Importantly, following CAF-CM incubation, ROS production was abolished in M2-like macrophages (P\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a02D, E). Even though ROS levels dropped during M1/M2 macrophage polarization, CAF-induced M2-like macrophages still seem to produce more ROS than THP-1 control monocytes (P\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a02D, E). Overall, these findings suggest that CAFs contribute to M2 polarization in part by increasing ROS production in monocytes, as M2 macrophages require a level of ROS for proper polarization.Isolation, characterization, and cellular uptake of exosomes derived from monocytesCharacterization and cellular uptake of purified exosomes derived from monocytes. The morphology and size of exosomes were observed using (A) transmission electron microscopy. B Representative dynamic light scattering (DLS) number distribution measurement of purified exosomes showed a single peak at\u2009~\u200990\u00a0nm. C Exosome-specific surface markers CD9 and CD81 were detected in exosomes by western blotting. The cytoplasmic protein marker Calnexin was expressed in the whole cell lysate but was undetectable in the isolated exosomes, indicating that the exosome preparations were not contaminated with other vesicles such as endoplasmic reticulum ones. D Cellular internalization of PKH26-labeled exosomes by MDA-MB-231 BC cells was visualized and imaged under a confocal microscope. The red fluorescence in the cytoplasm showed that exosomes were uptaken by MDA-MB-231 BC cells. The nuclear staining was performed by DAPITo uncover the paracrine effect of exosomes derived from CAF-educated monocytes on BC cells, we first isolated and purified exosomes from the conditioned media of monocytes educated with CAF or NF. The morphologically round and spherical shapes of purified exosomes with an approximate diameter ranging from ~\u200950\u2013150\u00a0nm were observed by TEM (Fig.\u00a03A). Also, the particle size distribution of exosomes by DLS revealed a single bell-shaped size distribution with a peak at ~\u200990\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a03B). Additionally, western blotting demonstrated that the exosome-specific tetraspanin markers CD9 and CD81 were enriched in the exosome preparation but not in the monocyte lysate. Conversely, the negative maker of Calnexin (the endoplasmic reticulum protein marker) was almost undetectable in the isolated exosomes, but highly expressed in cells (Fig.\u00a03C). To examine whether the monocyte-derived exosomes could be taken up by BC cells, PKH26-labeled exosomes were incubated with sub-confluent MDA-MB-231 BC cells for 18\u00a0h. Confocal microscopy imaging showed that monocyte exosomes can be incorporated and internalized into the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 BC cells (Fig.\u00a03D).CAF-educated monocytes and their derived exosomes exert immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting T-cell proliferationCAF-educated monocytes and their derived exosomes suppress T-cell proliferation. TEMo, NEMo, their corresponding exosomes as well as control monocytes were co-cultured with autologous peripheral T-cells which were labeled with CFSE for 72\u00a0h. Representative flow cytometry histograms (A) and bar graphs of proliferated T-cells (B) illustrated that TEMo and their derived exosomes (100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) had a greater inhibitory effect on T-cell proliferation when compared with control monocytes, NEMo, or derived exosomes. Effector cells (i.e., monocytes) were co-cultured with target cells (labeled T-cells) at the Effector: target (E:T) ratio of 1:4. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001CAFs are found to be a major cause of immunosuppression, partly through disrupting T-cell function in the tumor microenvironment. First, in order to explore the functional role of CAF-educated monocytes (TEMo) in promoting immunosuppression, human autologous peripheral T lymphocytes were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and co-cultured with control monocytes, NEMo, or TEMo. After 72\u00a0h, flow cytometry data showed that T-cell proliferation was inhibited by TEMo more markedly than control (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and NEMo (P\u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a04). Importantly, we found that 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from TEMO (TEMo-Exo) had a similar inhibitory effect on the proliferation of T-cells compared to that of cells co-cultured with control monocytes or treated with exosomes derived from NEMo (NEMo-Exo) (P\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a04). These data suggest that CAFs could exert their immunosuppressive effects on T-cells, at least in part and indirectly, through educating monocytes.CAF-activated monocytes lose their anti-tumoral functions and exhibit an M2 pro-tumoral phenotype, promoting BC cell proliferationCAF-activated, polarized monocytes lose their tumoricidal properties and their derived exosomes enhance the proliferation and migration of BC cells and up-regulate the expression of EMT markers. A The cytotoxic activity of monocytes alone or incubated with either CAF- or NF-CM was evaluated by measuring the luciferase activity of MDA-MB-231 BC cells expressing luciferase (MDA-MB-231-luc) in a co-culture condition. Bar graphs represent the relative luciferase activity, indicative of BC viability. The reduced luciferase activity of BC cells co-cultured with control monocytes pointed to the effective anti-tumoral functions of monocytes. In contrast, when monocytes were treated with CAF-CM, these cells lost their tumoricidal properties and instead promoted BC proliferation. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01. B MDA-MB-231 BC cells were incubated with exosomes derived from all differentiated monocytes. Results showed that different concentrations of TEMo-Exo (25, 50, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) have promoting effects on the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 BC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, BC cell proliferation was not substantially affected by incubation with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL NEMo-Exo as compared to PBS-treated BC cells. As expected, BC cells displayed the lowest rate of proliferation when incubated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL control monocyte exosomes at the indicated time points. Points, mean of three different experiments, bars, SD. ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001. C Representative photomicrographs of MDA-MB-231 BC cells cultured with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL exosomes derived from TEMo, NEMo, or control monocytes as well as in standard medium containing PBS at 24\u00a0h after scratch wounding. BC cells incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo exhibited a considerably higher migration potential compared with those incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NEMo. D, E Enhanced migration of MDA-MB-231 BC cells incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of TEMo-Exo, compared with the corresponding control cells. D Representative photomicrographs of the migration potential of MDA-MB-231 BC cells in different conditions after 24\u00a0h of incubation, assessed using the transwell assay. E Quantitative assessment of migrated cells showed that MDA-MB-231 BC cells treated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo exhibited a significantly higher migration potential compared with cells incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NEMo as well as cells cultured in standard medium containing PBS. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001. F Western blot analysis showed up-regulation of EMT protein markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail) and down-regulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 BC cells, 48\u00a0h after treatment with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo compared with the corresponding control cells. Actin was used as an endogenous loading control. Western blot images are representative of at least three independent experimentsM2 macrophages are typically pro-tumoral and lack the tumoricidal properties of M1 macrophages. Because CAF-CM was able to induce the up-regulation of M2-specific markers, suggesting a conversion of naive monocytes into M2 macrophages (Fig.\u00a01F, G), we first sought to investigate whether CAF-induced polarization of M2 macrophages is concomitant with the loss of tumoricidal properties of monocytes. In order to assess this phenotype, we co-cultured luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-231 BC cells (MDA-MB-231-luc) with monocytes maintained in the control medium, NF-CM, or CAF-CM. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, in co-cultured conditions with the control medium, the luciferase activity was remarkably diminished, suggesting the effective tumoricidal properties of monocytes. On the contrary, when monocytes were incubated with CAF-CM, these cells lost their ability to kill BC cells and instead enhanced the proliferation of BC cells. These data propose that CAFs may be able to influence the phenotype of monocytes by polarizing them to an M2 pro-tumoral phenotype, promoting BC cell proliferation.Exosomes secreted from CAF-educated monocytes enhance the proliferation and migration of BC cells and increase the expression of EMT markersTo investigate the effects of TEMo-Exo on BC cell proliferation and migration in vitro, MDA-MB-231 BC cells were incubated with exosomes derived from monocytes educated by CAF or NF. As shown in Fig.\u00a05B, treatment of different concentrations of TEMo-Exo markedly resulted in a significant increase in the proliferation rate of BC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. On the contrary, the proliferation rate of BC cells was not significantly affected following incubation with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from monocytes educated by NF, compared to the cells treated with vehicle control PBS. As expected, BC cells incubated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL control monocyte exosomes had the lowest rate of proliferation. Using a wound healing assay, we also found that the migration of BC cells into the scratched areas of monolayers was reduced in the presence of exosomes derived from control monocytes compared to PBS-treated BC cells. Importantly, we observed that when incubated with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL TEMo-Exo, BC cells migrated significantly faster than BC cells incubated with NEMo-Exo or vehicle control PBS (Fig.\u00a05C). Consistent with this observation, we found through a transwell migration assay that incubation of BC cells with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo led to significantly higher rates of migration through transwell membranes than those incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NF-educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a05D, E). Additionally, we showed that exposure to TEMo-Exo induced the protein expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MDA-MB-231 BC cells. As shown in Fig.\u00a05F, the expressions of EMT markers including N-cadherin, Vimentin, and Snail were found to be up-regulated and the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin was found to be down-regulated in BC cells by the effects of TEMo-Exo. On the contrary, neither EMT markers nor E-cadherin expression were significantly changed by the effects of NEMo-Exo, compared to that of control monocyte exosomes or PBS vehicle control. Overall, it seems that CAFs educate monocytes to secrete exosomes, which up-regulate the EMT markers and impart more migratory behavior in BC cells.CAF-educated monocyte exosomes promote breast cancer tumorigenicity in vivoExosomes derived from TEMo promote breast tumor growth in vivo.\nA Representative images of tumor-bearing nude mice subcutaneously implanted with MDA-MB-231 cells alone or mixed with exosomes derived from TEMo or NEMo. B Representative photographs of xenograft tumors obtained from mice at day 28 post-implantation. C Tumor volume at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after subcutaneous implantation of nude mice with MDA-MB-231 cells alone or mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from TEMo or NEMo. Co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 BC cells and TEMo-Exo together resulted in a faster growth rate of tumors and a larger tumor diameter than that of mice injected with either BC cells alone or BC cells mixed with NEMo Exo. ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001. D Tumor weight in mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 BC cells mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL TEMo-Exo was significantly higher than in those implanted with BC cells alone or mixed with NEMo Exo at day 28 post-implantation. ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001. E Representative photographs of H&E and IHC staining for Ki-67 on formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded MDA-MB-231-derived xenograft tumor sections from different treatment groups. IHC analysis of the cell proliferation marker Ki67 showed much higher immunoreactivity for nuclear Ki67 in the TEMo-Exo co-implantation group compared to the cell-only group or cells implanted with NEMo-Exo. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001To further assess the role of TEMo-Exo in tumor growth in vivo, we established tumor models in 6-week-old BALB/c nude mice by subcutaneously injecting MDA-MB-231 cells alone or MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL exosomes derived from monocytes educated by CAF. Tumor sizes were measured three times a week, and the observations lasted over 28\u00a0days after tumor challenges. As shown in Fig.\u00a06A\u2013D, tumor volume and weight in mice implanted with MDA-MB-231 BC cells mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL TEMo-Exo were significantly higher than in those implanted with BC cells alone. To test whether exosomes derived from NEMo also exert tumor-promoting effects, tumor growth in mice implanted with BC cells mixed with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL NEMo-Exo was measured, and the results showed that NEMo-Exo had no effect on promoting tumor growth compared to those of mice implanted with BC cells only. Furthermore, H&E staining of tumor sections revealed that cells from mice implanted with TEMo-Exo arranged more densely with a more irregular cell shape and had increased cell size when compared to the NEMo-Exo co-implantation group or negative control tumor group (Fig.\u00a06E). As Ki-67 indicates the proliferative ability of tumors, we examined Ki-67 expression in xenograft tumor sections. Consistently, IHC results revealed that tumor tissue from mice implanted with TEMo-Exo exhibited stronger positive staining than that in the cell-only group or cells co-implanted with NEMo-Exo (Fig.\u00a06E). Collectively, these results indicate that TEMo-Exo enhance the tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231 BC cells in vivo, while exosomes derived from control-educated monocytes have no significant effect on the growth of xenograft tumors.miR-181a is up-regulated in CAF-educated monocytes and their exosomes and represents a diagnostic potential for BC patientsThe pro-oncogenic effect of exosomes derived from TEMo on BC cell progression is partly dependent on miR-181a. A The relative expression level of plasma-derived circulating miR-181a in breast ductal carcinoma patients compared to healthy controls. A higher level of miR-181a was detected in BC plasma samples as compared with healthy controls, and, importantly, its expression level was correlated positively with tumor aggressiveness, as grade III tumors showed the highest expression of miR-181a with respect to grade I and II tumors. B, C Differential expression of miR-181 family members in TEMo and NEMo (B) as well as their corresponding exosomes (C). RT-qPCR results revealed a higher level of miR-181a in TEMo and TEMo-Exo compared to their normal counterparts. D The mean normalized ratio for miR-181a levels was assessed by RT-qPCR in MDA-MB-231 BC cells at 12 and 24\u00a0h time points. MDA-MB-231 BC cells were pre-treated with RNA polymerase inhibitor \u03b1-amanitin for 8\u00a0h before incubation with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo. The cells incubated with PBS and \u03b1-amanitin were used as a control. RT-qPCR results revealed that TEMo-secreted exosomal miR-181a is transferred to MDA-MB-231 BC cells in a time-dependent manner. E, F Representative flow cytometry histograms (E) and bar graphs (F) of cell cycle distribution in MDA-MB-231 BC cells in different conditions after 48\u00a0h of incubation. Flow cytometry results indicated transfection of miR-181a mimic caused BC cell progression similar to the cell cycle distribution observed in TEMo-Exo-treated BC cells. Additionally, inhibition of miR-181a resulted in the reduced distribution in the S and G2/M phases but induced an increased accumulation of cells in the sub G1 phase. Importantly, the TEMo-Exo-induced increases in S and G2/M proportions were partly prevented by reintroducing the miR-181a inhibitor, indicating that the promoting effect of TEMo-Exo on BC cell progression depends on miR-181a. G, H Representative photomicrographs (G) and bar graphs (H) illustrating the migration potential of MDA-MB-231 BC cells in different conditions after 24\u00a0h of incubation, assessed using a transwell assay. Overexpression of miR-181a recapitulated the promoting effect of TEMo-Exo on BC cell migration. However, miR-181a inhibition dramatically suppressed the phenotypes induced by TEMo-Exo in BC cells. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001Mounting evidence has confirmed that miRNAs play a substantial role in the initiation and progression of cancer. In this regard, the dynamic expression pattern of miRNAs may be associated with the progression of tumors. To identify circulating miRNAs that may be involved in BC progression, we performed a survey of public BC data sets for miRNA expression and found that miR-181a is among miRNAs to be frequently up-regulated in BC. To explore the clinical significance of circulating miR-181a in BC, we measured the expression level of this miRNA in BC plasma samples. RT-qPCR results revealed that miR-181a expression level was significantly up-regulated in BC patients compared with healthy individuals and, importantly, miR-181a expression level was positively correlated with tumor aggressiveness (Fig.\u00a07A). These findings confirm that plasma-derived miR-181a has the potential to be a diagnostic biomarker for BC patients.Being enriched in exosomes, miRNAs secreted from activated monocytes in the peritumoral stroma of tumor cells may contribute to inducing the malignant behavior of tumor cells. To describe the molecular mechanisms by which exosomes derived from monocytes educated with CAF promote the EMT response, we conjectured that miRNAs secreted by TEMo-Exo might account for the oncogenic effects of tumoral monocytes on BC cells. We first measured the expression of miR-181 family members in two groups of monocytes educated by CAF or NF. Fold change analysis in miRNA expression levels revealed a higher level of miR-181a in TEMo, while the expression of this miRNA did not show a significant difference compared to control-educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a07B). We also detected a high level of miR-181a in exosomes derived from TEMo as compared to those derived from NEMo (Fig.\u00a07C).Since exosomes facilitate the communication between adjacent cells by transferring miRNAs, we sought to examine the exosomal transfer of miR-181a from educated monocytes into BC cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL exosomes derived from monocytes educated with either CAF or NF at different time points and compared to control cells. Additionally, to confirm that miR-181a is transferred from monocytes into BC cells and not transcriptionally induced, we incubated BC cells with either monocyte exosomes or PBS in the presence of \u03b1-amanitin, which is an inhibitor of transcriptional activation. As shown in Fig.\u00a07D, a gradual increase in the level of miR-181a was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo, while the level of this miRNA did not show a significant difference in control BC cell groups (i.e., non-treated cells or BC cells treated with NEMo-Exo). These data confirm that miR-181a is enriched in exosomes derived from monocytes educated by CAFs and is shuttled by exosomes into BC cells.The pro-oncogenic effects of CAF-educated monocyte exosomes depend in part on miR-181a in BC cellsTo determine whether exosomes derived from TEMo promote the malignant phenotype of BC cells by transferring miR-181a, functional rescue experiments were performed. The miR-181a inhibitor was first transfected into exosome-treated BC cells. Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle distribution revealed that the proportion of BC cells in the S and G2/M phases in TEMo-Exo-treated BC cells was significantly higher than that in NEMo-Exo-treated control cells. Upon miR-181a silencing, the cells accumulated in the sub G1 phase, with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of cells in the S and G2/M phases. Consistently, transfection of miR-181a mimic recapitulated the promoting effects of TEMo-Exo on BC cell progression. Importantly, reintroducing the miR-181a inhibitor abolished the TEMo-Exo-caused increases in the proportions of cells in the S and G2/M phases (Fig.\u00a07E, F). Additionally, the stimulating effect of TEMo-Exo on BC cell migration was recapitulated by miR-181a overexpression. However, the promoting effects of TEMo-Exo on the migration of BC cells were effectively weakened by exogenous inhibition of miR-181a expression (Fig.\u00a07G, H). As miR-181a overexpression recapitulated the phenotypes induced by TEMo-Exo in BC cells, it is suggested that miR-181a shuttled by TEMo-Exo plays a vital role in promoting BC cell progression.miR-181a secreted from CAF-educated monocytes activates AKT signaling partly through suppressing PTEN in BC cellsTEMo-secreted miR-181a activates AKT signaling partly by inhibiting PTEN in BC cells. A Western blot analysis showed up-regulation of the phosphorylated levels of AKT and mTOR in MDA-MB-231 BC cells, 48\u00a0h after treatment with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo compared with the corresponding control cells. Results indicated that the promoting effects of TEMo-Exo on Akt\u2013mTOR signaling were partially abolished when the cells were transfected with the miR-181a inhibitor. B Western blot analysis revealed that when MDA-MB-231 BC cells were incubated with the AKT inhibitor MK-2206, the activation of the Akt\u2013mTOR signaling caused by miR-181a was suppressed. Actin was used as an endogenous loading control. Western blot images are representative of at least three independent experiments. C BC cells displayed the lowest rate of proliferation when treated with MK-2206 at the indicated time points. Although transfection of miR-181a mimic considerably increased the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 BC cells compared to control cells, miR-181a\u00a0did not increase BC cell proliferation in the cell group treated with MK-2206. Points, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01. D, E Representative photomicrographs (D) and bar graphs (E) illustrated that MK-2206 abrogated the promoting effect of miR-181a on BC cell migration. F Transfection of miR-181a mimic caused a significant reduction of PTEN expression at both mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 BC cells, suggesting that miR-181a may regulate PTEN in BC cells. G The mean normalized ratio for PTEN mRNA levels were measured by RT-qPCR in different conditions, 48\u00a0h after incubation. Results demonstrated that PTEN mRNA levels were considerably decreased in MDA-MB-231 BC cells incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo compared to those cells incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NEMo. In contrast, inhibition of miR-181a in MDA-MB-231 BC cells partially prevented the inhibitory effect of TEMo-Exo on PTEN expression. Columns, mean of three different experiments; bars, SD. *P-value\u2009<\u20090.05, **P-value\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P-value\u2009<\u20090.001We next analyzed the intracellular signaling that might be regulated by miR-181a secreted from TEMo in BC cells. As shown in Fig.\u00a08A, western blot analysis demonstrated a significant increase in phosphorylated AKT levels in MDA-MB-231 BC cells that were incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo compared to control cells. To investigate the functional role of exosomal miR-181a in AKT activation, we utilized a miR-181a inhibitor and found that the promoting effect of TEMo-Exo on AKT activation was partially abrogated when MDA-MB-231 BC cells were transfected with miR-181a inhibitor. To confirm that the exosomal transfer of miR-181a functionally correlates with AKT signaling, the phosphorylated levels of mTOR were measured in BC cells. Results showed that\u00a0inhibition of miR-181a reduced phosphorylated levels of mTOR in BC cells. As expected, the promoting effects of exosomes derived from TEMo on mTOR activation were partially rescued in the presence of the miR-181a inhibitor (Fig.\u00a08A). To further investigate whether Akt signaling is critically involved in miR-181a function in BC, we inhibited the Akt activity with MK-2206, which is clinically used for the treatment of human BC. Results showed that although transfection of miR-181a mimic led to the phosphorylation of Akt\u2013mTOR, MK-2206 treatment blocked miR-181a overexpression-induced activation of Akt\u2013mTOR signaling in BC cells (Fig.\u00a08B). Importantly, MK-2206 blocked the effects of miR-181a on the proliferation and migration of BC cells because miR-181a overexpression did not significantly increase the proliferation and migration rates in the group of cells treated with MK-2206 (Fig.\u00a08C\u2013E).Next, we explored the potential mechanism underlying miR-181a-mediated activation of Akt\u2013mTOR signaling. Among the predicted targets of miR-181a, PTEN is a key tumor suppressor gene, dysregulation of which is frequent in BC and is associated with poor prognosis. The PTEN encoding mRNA contains a putative miR-181a binding site within its 3\u2032-UTR (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). Since PTEN has been previously identified as a direct target of miR-181a and is a key upstream inhibitor of Akt\u2013mTOR signaling, we conjectured that the enhancing effects of TEMo-secreted miR-181a on AKT activation may be attributed to modulating PTEN. To this end, we transfected MDA-MB-231 BC cells with miR-181a mimic and indicated that miR-181a overexpression led to a significant reduction of PTEN expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig.\u00a08F), showing that miR-181a may regulate PTEN in BC cells. To highlight the functional paracrine effects of monocytes, we first measured the expression level of PTEN in MDA-MB-231 cells that were incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL exosomes derived from CAF- or NF-educated monocytes. RT-qPCR results showed that incubation of MDA-MB-231 cells with TEMo-Exo led to a significantly lower level of PTEN expression than those incubated with exosomes derived from control monocytes or NEMo (Fig.\u00a08G). Next, to reveal the functional effect of TEMo-secreted miR-181a on PTEN expression, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-181a inhibitor (100\u00a0nM) and stimulated with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL CAF-educated monocyte exosomes for 24\u00a0h. Importantly, following transfection with the miR-181a inhibitor, the inhibitory effect of CAF-educated monocyte exosomes on the PTEN mRNA expression level was partially rescued in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a08G), suggesting that down-regulation of PTEN is specific and largely dependent on the transfer of this exosome-shuttled miRNA. Next to MDA-MB-231 cells, we also examined the effect of exosomal transfer of miR-181a on another BC-derived cell line, MCF-7. The qRT-PCR results revealed that incubating \u03b1-amanitin-treated MCF-7 with 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL TEMo-Exo resulted in a gradual increase in the level of miR-181a at different time points, whereas there was no significant difference in the level of this miRNA in control cell groups. Moreover, results showed that the exosomal transfer of miR-181a from TEMo reduced PTEN expression in MCF-7 cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). Altogether, these findings support the notion that exosomes derived from TEMo play a role as an activator whereby they activate AKT signaling. We also came up with a plausible model in which TEMo-secreted miR-181a activates AKT signaling through regulating PTEN in BC cells.DiscussionIn recent years, the TME has attracted increasing attention due to its critical roles in multiple stages of disease progression, particularly tumor immunosuppression, local resistance, distant metastasis, and targeted therapy outcome. Although BC is considered a heterogeneous disease characterized by aberrant mutations in mammary tumor cells, it is now clearly apparent that such tumors are also diverse by the nature of their microenvironmental composition and the activity of their stromal cell proportions. CAFs, as one of the most important stromal components in the TME, confer a mesenchymal-like phenotype to malignant epithelial cells and support tumor growth and metastasis. In addition to playing tumor-promoting roles in the initiation and progression of tumor growth, CAFs were also shown to sculpt the TME. It was proposed that the tumor-promoting secretome of CAFs may exert potent remodeling effects on tumor immunity, affecting innate immune cell recruitment and activation and polarizing the adaptive immune response.There exists a close relationship between TAMs and CAFs, as TAMs are the most common type of immune cell in close proximity to CAF-populated areas. High infiltration of TAMs in tumors correlates with tumor aggressiveness and reduces overall and recurrence-free survival. There are several TME-derived factors that trigger monocyte recruitment into tumor tissues by a hypoxia-induced chemoattractant gradient. Previous studies demonstrated that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) take part in monocyte recruitment into breast tumors as chemotactic cytokines secreted by stromal cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs obtained from invasive BC could recruit and subsequently differentiate monocytes into M2-like pro-tumoral macrophages in terms of both phenotypic features and functions, in contrast to fibroblasts obtained from normal breast (Figs. 1, 2). Consistently, there are several studies indicating that CAFs induce the M2 polarization of TAMs, which is characterized by an IL-12low IL-10high phenotype and up-regulating M2-specific markers CD163 and CD206. Mounting evidence suggests that redox signaling plays a role in macrophage polarization. It is thought that ROS in macrophages is required for the phagocytosis and clearance of apoptotic cells. However, sustaining a high amount of ROS may not be tolerated by macrophages because inducible ROS has been shown to trigger macrophage apoptosis. The involvement of ROS in regulating the functional reprogramming of macrophages may determine the macrophage\u2019s ability to mediate phagocytosis. Previous studies have shown that increasing the levels of ROS in the TME can contribute to the\u00a0differentiation of M2-polarized macrophages. Consistently, we found that the M2 phenotype transformation induced by CAF was concomitant with increased ROS production in differentiated THP-1 macrophages. Despite ROS levels being reduced during M1/M2 macrophage polarization, CAF-induced M2-like macrophages still appear to produce a higher level of ROS than THP-1 control monocytes (Fig.\u00a02D, E). These observations implicated ROS as being a component in the M2 phenotype whose levels may be adjusted by tumor stromal cells.Though the CAF secretome is still not fully characterized, there is evidence that CAF-secreted cytokines and growth factors may trigger the immunosuppressive functions that involve various immune cells and stages of anti-tumoral activity. Recent studies have highlighted the direct implication of CAFs in the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by excluding T-cells from tumors. In line with these findings, our data revealed that CAF-educated monocytes were able to considerably suppress T-cell proliferation, in contrast to their normal counterparts. Moreover, treatment of T-cells with exosomes derived from TEMo or NEMo exhibited effects comparable to co-culture with educated monocytes, indicating the significance of the biological functions of exosomes (Fig.\u00a04). Therefore, by educating monocytes into a distinct population of macrophages that exhibit an M2-like phenotype, CAFs may exert their immunosuppressive effects through driving T-cell exclusion in an indirect fashion.Apart from reciprocal communication with each other, both CAFs and TAMs are in a dynamic interaction with the tumor cells in the tumor milieu. In BC, TAMs comprise about half of the cell tumor mass and can in turn facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. Supporting this notion are the observations whereby the cross-talk between M2-polarized TAMs and tumor cells is responsible for inducing EMT to promote tumor metastasis. Previous studies have shown that immunosuppressive cytokines and survival factors secreted by TAMs promote BC progression and metastasis. Since TAMs may secrete paracrine factors that drive the phenotypic and signaling pathway alterations across the tumor cohort, we here sought to investigate whether exosomes secreted from TEMo affect tumor growth. We revealed that TEMo-Exo augmented BC cell proliferation and migration as well as the expression of EMT markers, while exosomes derived from control-educated monocytes had no effect on the aggressive behavior of BC cells (Fig.\u00a05). Importantly, TEMo-Exo, but not NEMo-Exo, exhibited the potential to induce tumor growth and enhanced the expression of the tumor proliferation marker Ki-67 in BC xenograft tumors (Fig.\u00a06). Tumor cell-bearing athymic nude mice lack a thymus to produce T-cells but possess B-cells capable of producing antibodies in a T-cell-independent way. This model contains intact innate immunity with enhanced natural killer (NK) cell activity, which can reduce the rate of engraftment, growth, and metastasis formation. The subcutaneous heterotopic model is the most common one due to its relative simplicity in design and evaluation, provides realistic heterogeneity of tumor cells, and allows for rapid analysis of the human tumor response to a treatment regimen. As the activity of NK cells tends to increase with age, we utilized younger mice (6\u00a0weeks old) to enhance the engraftment rate, and, thus, the reproducibility of the assays. Our findings led us to suggest that CAFs may aid tumor growth in an athymic nude mouse model of BC by educating monocytes and their derivative exosomes.Although CAFs are important in the formation of TME and in interacting with tumor cells, the effects of their secretome on the behavior of immune stromal cells, particularly in terms of tumor progression, require further investigation. Most current studies focus on the cytokines or regulatory protein factors that are secreted by macrophages. However, close attention needs to be paid to miRNAs, which are considered key regulators of tumorigenesis and, more importantly, are selectively secreted by TAM-derived exosomes. Because aberrant expression and function of miRNAs are common characteristics of malignant cells, these small RNAs provide important opportunities for the development of future miRNA-based therapies for human cancers such as BC. miR-181a was found to be a miRNA associated with BC progression, and up-regulation of which was detected in plasma samples of breast ductal carcinoma patients. Additionally, our data demonstrated that there are differences between exosomes derived from TEMo and their normal counterparts in terms of both miR-181a content and BC cell progression (Fig.\u00a07). To define a possible mechanism through which miR-181a may promote BC cell progression, we explored the downstream mechanism of miR-181a and its relation with the relevant intracellular signaling. Studies on the downstream targets of miR-181a have revealed PTEN as a key tumor-suppressor gene. PTEN constitutes a main inhibitory node in Akt signaling as it functions as a PIP3 phosphatase. Loss of PTEN function results in constitutive activation of AKT which plays a crucial role in breast tumorigenesis. Herein, our functional analyses validated the oncogenic role of miR-181a by regulating PTEN to promote the more aggressive phenotypes of BC cells by activating AKT signaling. As miR-181a overexpression recapitulated the effects of TEMo-Exo on BC cells, it is proposed that exosomal transfer of miR-181a contributes to promoting BC cell progression (Figs. 7, 8).ConclusionsA proposed model illustrating how CAFs drive a more aggressive phenotype in BC by recruiting monocytes in a paracrine manner. CAFs contribute to preparing an immunosuppressive TME by recruiting monocytes and educating them into a distinct population of macrophages exhibiting an M2-like phenotype. As a plausible mechanism, exosomal transfer of miR-181a from CAF-educated monocytes is partly associated with activating Akt signaling and up-regulating EMT markers, thereby promoting breast tumor progression and growthIn conclusion, this study proposed a model illustrating how CAF secretome induces a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by recruiting monocytes. Our study provided the first evidence that exosomal transfer of a miRNA from CAF-educated monocytes may promote BC cell progression through activating Akt signaling (Fig.\u00a09). Given that a miRNA has many targets and may function via different pathways, the current findings do not exclusively demonstrate the exact mechanism by which tumor-educated monocytes affect BC progression. However, our findings suggest that breast CAFs play a crucial role in shaping an immunosuppressive TME by recruiting monocytes in a paracrine manner. We proposed that exosomal miR-181a shuttled by these CAF-activated monocytes was in part associated with activating Akt signaling, thereby promoting BC progression. Obviously, uncovering the pro-tumoral function of CAFs through educating monocytes into a distinct population of macrophages exhibiting an M2-like phenotype holds great promise in targeted cancer therapy. In this regard, a deeper understanding of the intercellular miRNA communication between immune stromal and tumor cells may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention against BC.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerTMETumor microenvironmentCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsNFsNormal fibroblastsTAMsTumor-associated macrophagesTEMoTumoral fibroblast-educated monocytesNEMoNormal fibroblasts-educated monocytesPBMCsPeripheral blood mononuclear cellsEMTEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionCMConditioned mediaSMASmooth muscle actinFAPFibroblast-activation proteinPD-1Programmed cell death protein 1MHCMajor histocompatibility complexMCP-1Monocyte chemotactic protein-1SDF-1Stromal cell-derived factor-1ExoExosomesMiRNA or miRMicroRNADIANADNA Intelligent AnalysisKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesPMAPhorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateH&EHematoxylin and eosinIHCImmunohistochemistryELISAEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTEMTransmission electron microscopyDLSDynamic light scatteringCFSECarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl esterPIPropidium iodideROSReactive oxygen speciesPublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author contributionsSB conceived and designed the study.

        "content": "The lack of targeted therapy for women with triple negative breast cancer demands a \"think-outside-the-box\" approach in search of novel treatment strategies. Although cancer drug development traditionally focused on targeting the tumor cell cycle, emphasis has recently shifted toward the tumor microenvironment for novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic composite of cells broadly categorized as immune cells and nonimmune cells within a scaffold of extracellular matrix, where tumor cells thrive. Among the various nonimmune cell types, cancer stromal cells have emerged as critical players in promoting tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis as well as interacting with immune cells to tilt the equilibrium toward a tolerogenic environment that favors the tumor cells. In view of recent work that demonstrated that the depletion of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressing tumor stromal cells resulted in stunted tumor growth and improved response to tumor vaccination, the tumor microenvironment is, therefore, fertile ground for development of novel therapy with the potential of augmenting existing treatment and prevention options. In this review, we will focus on current evidence supporting the role of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with a special focus on FAP(+) stromal cells, in promoting tumor growth. The role of CAFs in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which may accelerate tumor progression, will be discussed with the hope that therapeutics developed to target the \"generic\" tumor microenvironment may be effective for malignancies such as triple negative breast cancer, for which targeted therapy is not available to date, in the future.",

        "content": "The biological heterogeneity of breast cancer leads to the need for finding new approaches to understand the mechanisms implicated in breast cancer progression. The tumor stroma appears as a key in the progression of solid tumors towards a malignant phenotype. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may orchestrate a functional \"corrupted\" stroma which in turn helps metastatic spread. In this study, we investigated by real-time PCR, the expression of 19 factors by normal breast-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) and CAFs, which were implicated in several actions promoting tumor growth, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation and invasion. Also, we explored the influence of inflammatory cells phenotypes (MMP11 status) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) on the molecular profile of CAFs. If we consider that one of the major sources of CAFs are resident NAFs, the transition of NAFs into CAFs is associated with molecular changes involving the overexpression of some molecular factors of biological importance in tumor progression. In addition, the characterization of the tumor stroma regarding to the MMP11 status by MICs reflects a type of fibroblasts which contribute even more to tumor progression. Moreover, different patterns in the induction of the expression of factors by CAFs were observed, depending on the tumor cell line which they were co-cultured with. Furthermore, CAFs influence TGF\u03b2 expression in both cancer cell lines. Therefore, this study can help to a better characterization of tumor stroma in order to improve the prognostic evaluation, as well as to define the different populations of CAFs as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "content": "Intratumoral hypoxia induces the recruitment of stromal cells, such as macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which stimulate invasion and metastasis by breast cancer cells (BCCs). Production of macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) by BCCs is required for macrophage recruitment, but the mechanisms underlying CSF1 expression have not been delineated. Triple-negative breast cancers have increased expression of genes regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). In this study, we delineate two feed-forward signaling loops between human MDA-MB-231 triple-negative BCCs and human MSCs that drive stromal cell recruitment to primary breast tumors. The first loop, in which BCCs secrete chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 16 (CXCL16) that binds to C-X-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CXCR6) on MSCs and MSCs secrete chemokine CXCL10 that binds to receptor CXCR3 on BCCs, drives recruitment of MSCs. The second loop, in which MSCs secrete chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 that binds to C-C chemokine receptor type 5 on BCCs and BCCs secrete cytokine CSF1 that binds to the CSF1 receptor on MSCs, drives recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These two signaling loops operate independent of each other, but both are dependent on the transcriptional activity of HIFs, with hypoxia serving as a pathophysiological signal that synergizes with chemokine signals from MSCs to trigger CSF1 gene transcription in triple-negative BCCs.

Despite the fact that most of our understanding of cancer centers on those events taking place within the cancer epithelium, the cancer-associated stroma also plays a co-dominant role in shaping the biological and clinical fates of the disease. Specifically, the carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) has been shown to be a major player in the stroma\u2019s influence on tumor growth. Many reports have focused on the role that CAFs have in regulating TGF-\u03b2 signalling and angiogenesis through secreted factors such as SDF-1 and VEGF. CAFs have shown the ability to both promote and repress MCF-7 cell growth in vitro, in addition to having no effect at all. Importantly, none of these studies took account of possible inter-patient CAF heterogeneity largely because, unlike tumor heterogeneity, little data exists about inter-patient CAF heterogeneity.In particular, one in vitro model using a series of breast cancer cell lines directly co-cultured with normal human fibroblasts demonstrated that human fibroblasts will induce a type-one interferon response when admixed with tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, this type-one interferon response signature was shown to be expressed in a large proportion of breast tumors contained in the NKI breast tumor microarray dataset and its expression in whole breast tumors was associated with a significantly poorer prognosis. In addition, this outcome was confirmed in an independent patient cohort in which immunohistochemical analysis of phospho-STAT1 was used as a proxy for the presence of the type-one interferon response.In this report we show that there exists a subset of CAFs which express a type one interferon response which is stable upon ex vivo cultivation. This interferon response can impart a paracrine growth-promoting effect on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Our findings suggest that an understanding of CAF molecular heterogeneity can be used to construct relevant preclinical in vitro models of tumor-stromal interactions.MethodsTissue culturePrimary tissue culture was carried out as previously outlined. Briefly, invasive breast carcinoma specimens were surgically resected from patients at the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, Canada). CAFs were determined to be intratumoral by a certified pathologist. Tissues were minced with a sterile blade and resuspended in a solution of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 3% collagenase overnight at 37 degrees Celsius. The next day samples were filtered through an 8\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0mesh in order to remove undigested debris. The single cell suspension with viable fibroblasts was cultured in DMEM (10% FBS) for 2\u20133 weeks in a 24 well plate and then transferred to a T75 flask where it was continually maintained in a 2% FBS medium solution. All fibroblasts were harvested between passage doublings 3\u20135. Normal breast fibroblasts from reduction mammoplasties were collected at the same institution and in the same manner as the CAFs noted above. All fibroblast cultures underwent immunocytochemical analyses for pan-cytokeratin and vimentin as previously described by our group to confirm their mesenchymal identity. All protocols involving human tissues were approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research of McGill University and were in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. Furthermore, all tissues procured from both reduction mammoplasty and tumor resection surgeries were obtained with the written informed consent of all patients.DNA microarray expression profilingGene expression profiling was carried out as described previously. Briefly, fibroblasts were harvested from subconfluent cultures, cultivated in DMEM with 2% FBS. RNA was then extracted using the Mini RNA Extraction kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). Five micrograms of total RNA was reversed transcribed with the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Aglient Technologies, Santa Clara, California). The resulting cDNA was then precipitated with 70% ethanol, air-dried, resuspended in 5\u00a0\u03bcL of coupling buffer, and dissolved at 37\u00b0C for 15\u00a0minutes. Five microliters of Cy3 or Cy5 dye were added to the universal reference (Aglient Technologies) or fibroblast cDNA, respectively, and allowed to incorporate for 30\u00a0minutes at room temperature. Labeled cDNA was cleaned-up using Fairplay columns (Aglient Technologies) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Labeled reference and fibroblast cDNA samples were combined and mixed with gene expression hybridization buffer and control targets supplied by the manufacturer and hybridized to a 4\u2009\u00d7\u200944\u00a0K two-color whole human genome gene expression array for 17\u00a0hours at 65\u00b0C. The array was then washed in a solution of 6\u00d7 SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine followed by a solution of 0.06\u00d7 SSPE, 0.005% lauroylsarcosine and scanned on the Agilent DNA Microarray scanner at a resolution of 5\u00a0\u03bcm. All images were extracted and normalized with Feature Extraction software version 9.5. The microarray data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE29270.Analysis of fibroblast and Co-culture expression profiling dataBreast carcinoma derived fibroblasts were cultured and expression profiled as outlined previously by our group. This dataset was analyzed using the straight-forward approach demonstrated by Sorlie and colleagues: any gene that was two-fold above the median value for that gene in at least 3 patient samples was retained. Unsupervised clustering (Pearson\u2019s correlation) was then performed using TIGR MeV version 4.1. In the case of the expression profiling on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, the three conditions (see below) were compared in a supervised 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 manner using the SAM algorithm. The samples were then clustered in the same way as the unsupervised manner. This was also carried out by using TIGR MeV version 4.1.Interferon-\u03b2 Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA)Subconfluent fibroblast cultures were allowed to incubate in DMEM (2% FBS) for 48\u00a0hours at which time the medium was collected and spun down for five minutes at 1500\u00a0rpm in order to remove debris. An ELISA assay was carried out as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the Human Interferon-\u03b2 kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota).In vitro co-culture modelAll experiments were carried out in DMEM media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. 5000 MCF-7 cells (American Tissue Type Collection, Manassas, Virginia) were plated into flat bottom 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. 600\u00a0\u03bcl of fresh media was then added and a semi-permeable insert with a 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm pore size (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) was placed over the media. 5000 fibroblasts were then seeded into the insert, re-suspended in 400\u00a0\u03bcl of media for a total co-culture volume of 1\u00a0ml/well. Monoclonal antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added at this time if necessary. After co-cultures had incubated for the appropriate time, inserts and fibroblasts were removed and MTT reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) was added to the media (1:10 ratio) and allowed to incubate for 2\u00a0hours after which the media was aspirated and 1\u00a0ml of DMSO was added. The absorbance was measured at 570\u00a0nm. For RNA or protein harvesting, co-cultures were performed in 6-well dishes with appropriate transwell insert (Millipore) using 25,000 of each cell type in a total co-culture volume of 4\u00a0ml. After the appropriate co-incubation time, cells were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA harvesting.Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (Q-RT-PCR)Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Stratagene\u2019s AffinityScript Multiple Temperature cDNA Synthesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1\u00a0\u03bcl of oligo(dT) primer was added to 5ug of total RNA and allowed to incubate at 65\u00b0C for five minutes. The reaction was subsequently cooled to room temperature. The following reactants were then added for a total volume of 20\u00a0\u03bcl : 2.0\u00a0\u03bcl of 10\u00d7 AffinityScript RT Buffer, 0.8\u00a0\u03bcl of dNTP mix (25\u00a0mM of each dNTP), 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl of RNase Block Ribonuclease Inhibitor (40 U/\u03bcl) and 1\u00a0\u03bcl of reverse transcriptase. The reaction was carried out at 42\u00b0C for one hour and terminated by a 15\u00a0minute incubation at 70\u00b0C. The parameters for the interferon-associated Q-RT-PCR were adapted from Buess et al.. PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 10\u00a0\u03bcl. Two micrograms of synthesized cDNA, 5\u00a0\u03bcl of 2\u00d7 SYBR \u00aeGreen PCR Master Mix (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA) and 1\u00a0\u03bcl (10\u00a0\u03bcM ) of each primer (sequences: OAS2, forward GGAATACCTGAAGCCCTACGAA, reverse CCTGCAGACGTCACAGATGGT; IFN\u03b2, forward ACCTCCGAAACTGAAGATCTCCTA, reverse TGCTGGTTGAAGAATGCTTGA; GAPDH, forward GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC, reverse GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC). Primers were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California) and adapted from Buess et al. All reactions were carried out in an ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System using the following amplification conditions: 50\u00b0C for 2\u00a0minutes, 94\u00b0C for 10\u00a0minutes, followed by 40\u00a0cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15\u00a0s and 60\u00b0C for 60\u00a0seconds. All reactions were carried out in triplicate.NKI295 database analysisPatients were split into high and low expressers of our IFN signature by hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean and Ward\u2019s algorithm. A univariate Kaplan Meier analysis was then carried out in order to assess the prognostic significance of the IFN signature. Secondly, patients in the NKI patient cohort were split into two groups (high and low) based on their expression of S100A2 using hierarchical clustering. The low and high S100A2 expresser groups were separately clustered with the IFN signature. Kaplan Meier curves were subsequently generated.ResultsGene expression profiling reveals the presence of a CAF subtype that is positive for a type one interferon responseHierarchical clustering of CAFs reveals interferon positive CAF subset. (A) Hierarchical clustering (HCL) of the 23 CAFs. DNA microarray data were filtered for genes that were 2-fold above or below the mean for that gene in a minimum of 3 samples. This resulted in a total of 2506 genes which are shown clustered above. (B) Magnification of the gene cluster highlighted by the red bar in Figure\u00a01A. Further inspection of this cluster shows the upregulation of many type-one interferon genes in addition to a host of cytokines in five of the CAFs analyzed. (C) An IFN-\u03b2 ELISA of DMEM (2% FBS) cultured with sub-confluent fibroblasts (3 normal breast fibroblast, 3 IFN-negative CAFs and 3 IFN-positive CAFs) for 48\u00a0hours. IFN-\u03b2 ligand was only detected in the 3 IFN-positive CAF supernatents. (D) Q-RT-PCR analysis on frozen whole tumor sections corresponding to two IFN-positive and two IFN-negative CAFs. The IFN-positive CAFs (T35 and T44) showed a greatly increased level of both IFN markers IFN-\u03b2 and OAS2 relative to the IFN-negative tumors (T77 and T79) (p\u2009<\u20090.001, by way of Bonferroni Multiple comparison test following a one-way ANOVA).Interrogation of the NKI295 breast cancer microarray dataset for the clinical significance of the IFN signature shown in Figure1. (A) the IFN signature was able to divide the cohort into two groups; one consisting of 154 patients (high IFN expressers) and the second consisting of 141 patients (low IFN expressers). Bars at the bottom of the figure indicate various histopathological characteristics of the tumors/patients whose microarray data appear in the corresponding column. \u2018Outcome\u2019: red denotes recurrence, white denotes no recurrence. \u2018Grade\u2019 refers to the histological grade of the breast carcinoma: red is grade 3, pink is grade 2 and white is grade 1. \u2018Lymph node\u2019: red indicates that the patient has axillary lymph node dissemination of the breast carcinoma, whereas white is negative for lymph node dissemination. \u2018HER2\u2019: orange indicates that the patient\u2019s carcinoma was positive for HER2 over-expression, and white indicates negativity. \u2018ER\u2019: green indicates estrogen positive disease and white indicates estrogen receptor negative disease. \u2018Interferon\u2019: red are patients who cluster in the interferon positive group and blue are patients who do not overexpress the interferon cluster of genes. \u2018Wound\u2019: red denotes patients who are positive for the wound response signature of Chang et al. and blue are those that do not overexpress the wound response. (B) These two distinct groups had a significantly different outcome with the high expressers of IFN displaying a greater rate of recurrence than the low IFN expressers.We carried out gene expression profiling of primary breast CAFs. This dataset consisted of 23 patient-derived CAFs that were cultured for a minimum of 3 doublings and a maximum of 6 doublings in low serum conditions. In these analyses the data were filtered for the most variably expressed genes; any gene that was 2-fold above or below the mean for that gene in at least 3 of the 23 samples was retained. This strategy yielded a filtered list of 2506 genes. Upon hierarchical clustering the CAF cohort was clearly subdivided into two distinct groups (Figure\u00a01A). Upon closer inspection it was evident that a group of 5 CAFs (T35, T63, T38, T44, T65) clustered tightly together and that this pattern was largely due to the overexpression of a coordinated gene cluster (Figure\u00a01B). This expression block consisted of 101 genes and has members such as MX1, MX2, OAS1, OAS2, IFI27 and IFI30 greatly overexpressed within it, compared to the other CAFs, strongly suggesting that it represents an activated type one interferon response pattern. The type one interferon mediators were present in addition to several cytokine and chemokine transcripts (Figure\u00a01B). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of two key interferon response genes, MX1 and OAS2, validated microarray gene expression results (Additional file 1: Figure S1) showing significantly higher expression levels in CAFs found within the activated interferon response cluster. In addition, Q-RT-PCR analysis of the IFN-\u03b2 gene was correlated with RNA expression of MX1, suggesting that this particular type one interferon response was likely due to interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) ligand expression (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Specifically, by Q-PCR, the five highest expressers of IFN-b were T65, T63, T73, T44, T38 which had an average MX1/GAPDH QPCR ratio of 3.19 versus a ratio of 0.05 in the rest of the cohort (p\u2009=\u20090.005). Four of these five CAFs grouped closely in the microarray clustering data with the one that did not (T73CAF) still showing positivity for much of the IFN gene expression cluster (Figure\u00a01). Next, by way of ELISA, we confirmed the presence of the IFN-\u03b2 ligand in the tissue culture supernatants of activated IFN-response CAFs and lack of the ligand in normal breast fibroblasts and IFN-negative CAFs (Figure\u00a01C). We then found that RNA extracted from two whole tumor sections whose CAFs were deemed negative for the type one interferon response via microarray and Q-RT-PCR analyses, showed considerably lower levels of both IFN-\u03b2 and OAS2 as compared to whole tumors from two patients from whom activated interferon response CAFs were obtained (Figure\u00a01D). These findings suggest that the interferon response we observed in our CAFs was unlikely due to an ex vivo tissue culture artefact. Finally, we used our 101 gene CAF-derived cytokine-enriched interferon signature to interrogate the NKI295 breast cancer microarray dataset (Figure\u00a02). Consistent with Buess et al\u2019s findings, our cytokine enriched interferon signature was deemed to be over expressed in 154 of the 295 patients and patients with tumors showing such over-expession showed a worse outcome than those with tumors that fell into the interferon negative group (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20090.56, p\u2009=\u20090.0037).Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts impart pro-cancer effects on the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in an indirect heterotypic co-culture systemMCF-7-CAF co-culture phenotype. Three types of fibroblasts were involved in co-cultures with the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Normal breast fibrobasts are denoted in green, IFN-negative CAFs in blue and IFN-positive CAFs in red. All experiments were performed in triplicate. A single 120\u00a0hour time point is shown. Statistical differences were ascertained by an analysis of variance. Double asterisks represent samples that were deemed to be significantly different (p\u2009<\u20090.01) from the MCF-7 grown in mono-culture (post-hoc test: Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test). Five of six CAFs showed significant growth promotion of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line in this model.In order to test the effects of IFN-positive CAFs on the growth of breast cancer cells we developed an in vitro co-culture model in which fibroblasts were indirectly co-cultured with the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line for 120\u00a0hours. The fibroblasts and MCF-7 cells were separated by a semi-permeable membrane (pore size of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcm) with the MCF-7 cells being cultured on the bottom layer. At the desired time point, the transwell insert containing the fibroblasts was discarded and the MCF-7\u00a0s were either assayed by way of the MTT cell viability reagent or harvested for RNA and/or protein. Fibroblasts from three of each type of patient (IFN-negative, IFN-positive and normal reduction mammoplasty) were co-cultured with the breast cancer cell line. We found that co-culturing CAFs with MCF-7 breast cancer cells increased the proliferation rate of the latter, unlike co-culturing with normal breast fibroblasts (NBF) (Figure\u00a03). Interestingly, one of the IFN-negative CAFs (T48CAF) was not capable of promoting MCF-7 proliferation, while the other two IFN-negative CAFs increased MCF-7 cell proliferation to an equal or greater degree as compared to the three IFN-positive CAFs.The pro-MCF-7 effects by IFN-positive CAFs are dependent on the continued action of the IFN-\u03b2 ligand whereas this is not a requirement for the pro-MCF-7 effects of the IFN-negative CAFsIFN-\u03b2 is responsible for the positive effect of IFN-positive CAFs on MCF-7 proliferation. Three IFN-positive CAFs, T38, T44, T65, were co-cultured as previously described. In this experiment, two new conditions where added: once triplicate for each day was reserved for the addition of 20\u00a0\u03bcg of an IgG1 isotype control antibody (second darkest shade) and another for 20\u00a0\u03bcg of neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 antibody (darkest shade). A Bonferonni multiple comparison test was carried out after a one-way ANOVA was performed on the four conditions at 120\u00a0hours. The asterisks represent the significant difference between the co-culture with the IgG isotype control and the co-culture with the neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 antibody (*, p\u2009<\u20090.05; ***, p\u2009<\u20090.001).To determine if the type-one interferon response in CAFs is responsible for their ability to promote MCF-7 growth, we repeated the co-culture proliferation assays in the presence of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against the IFN-\u03b2 ligand in the co-culture medium (Figure\u00a04). When IFN-\u03b2 antibody was added to the culture medium, all 3 co-cultures involving the IFN-positive CAFs demonstrated a significant reversion of the phenotype, to proliferation levels very near that of MCF-7 cells cultured in the absence of CAFs. Thus the pro-proliferative effect on MCF-7 cells of the IFN-positive CAFs is dependent on the presence of IFN-\u03b2. Of note, the addition of the anti-IFN-\u03b2 antibody did not result in reversal of growth promoting effects in co-cultures with IFN-negative CAFs (Additional file 3: Figure S3).Microarray analysis of the IFN-positive-CAF-MCF-7 co-cultures reveals the presence of the candidate tumor suppressor gene S100A2 as a putative mediator of the pro-cancer heterotypic phenotypeGene expression analysis shows that S100A2 expression in MCF-7 cells is modulated by the activity of IFN-positive CAFs. (A) A 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 SAM analysis was carried out to compare MCF-7\u00a0s under three different conditions: MCF-7 monocultured with only the IgG1 antibody, MCF-7 co-cultured with two IFN-positive CAFs and the IgG1 antibody, and MCF-7 co-cultured with the same two IFN-positive CAFs in addition to the neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 monoclonal antibody. 995 modulated genes and corresponding clustering are displayed. (B) The 19 transcripts that are significantly different between the second condition and both the first and third conditions are magnified. S100A2 (red arrow) is highlighted. (C)S100A2\u2019s differential mRNA expression was confirmed by Q-RT-PCR. An ANOVA analysis followed by a Bonferonni multiple comparison test was performed to show that S100A2 expression rose when the IFN-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody was added to the IFN-positive co-culture. (D) The Kaplan Meir analysis on the NKI295 cohort when S100A2 expression is low (left) shows that IFN-positive patients (red) have a significantly shorter survival duration when compared to IFN-negative (blue) patients. Conversely, when S100A2 expression is high (plot on right), the IFN-positive and negative groups have statistically indistinguishable survival profiles.In order to gain a greater understanding of the molecular mediator(s) of the pro-proliferative effects of the IFN-positive CAFs, we carried out gene expression profiling of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line under various co-culture and mono-culture conditions. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was grown alone or co-cultured with the IFN-positive CAFs T38 and T44, in the presence of IgG1 or neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies for 72\u00a0hours at which point RNA was harvested from the breast cancer cell line. We carried out a supervised clustering approach comparing three different groups of samples in a 2x2x2 study design; MCF-7 breast cancer cell line with IgG1 isotype control antibody, MCF-7 co-cultured with the two IFN-positive CAFs and the IgG1 antibody and lastly, MCF-7 co-cultured with the two IFN-positive CAFs and treated with the IFN-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody. There were a total of 995 differentially expressed genes when a false discovery rate of 5% was applied to the SAM analysis (Figure\u00a05A). Notably, the overwhelming majority of differentially expressed genes were between mono-culture and co-culture conditions. There was however a group of genes that was significantly down-regulated under co-culture conditions but reverted back to higher expression levels when the IFN-\u03b2 neutralizing antibody was added to the co-culture. This group consisted of 19 transcripts of which 12 were annotated genes. Given that the lower expression of these genes correlated with the pro-growth phenotype (Figures\u00a04 and 5A) we reasoned that any putative effector gene in this cluster should function in a tumor-suppressor-like manner if it is to modulate the phenotype we observed. One of these genes , S100A2, had already been identified as a putative tumor suppressor in breast as well as in other types of cancers. These microarray finds were confirmed by way of Q-RT-PCR (Figure\u00a05C). We then interrogated the NKI295 database in order to evaluate the S100A2 gene as a univariate predictor; there was no correlation between outcome and expression levels (data not shown). Next, we separated the entire cohort into the respective high and low expressers of S100A2 according to the median values of S100A2 expression, and recalculated the Kaplan-Meir curves based on our interferon signature. In the low S100A2 group (Figure\u00a05D, left), the high and low IFN expressers were split precisely in half (n\u2009=\u200988 in each group), with the high expressers of the IFN signature showing a poorer prognostic outcome as compared to the low expressers (HR\u2009=\u20090.54, p\u2009=\u20090.023), consistent with our previous analyses. However, when S100A2 was relatively overexpressed this poor outcome associated with the interferon response was not observed, with the high and low expressers of the interferon signature showing a statistically indistinguishable survival outcome (Figure\u00a05D, right). In addition, regarding the molecular subtypes of breast cancers in the NKI295 database, the basal and HER2 positive subtypes carry a significantly increased proportion of IFN positive patients versus the other three classical subtypes (chi squared\u2009=\u200982.8539, df\u2009=\u20094, p-value\u2009<\u20092.2e-16). Interestingly, even after segregating the cohort based on IFN status, which enriches for HER2 and basal poor outcome patients, S100A2 status is still able to demonstrate survival differences in the cohort (Figure\u00a05D). Additional file 4: Figure S4 shows the overlap in molecular subtype, IFN status and S100A2 status in the NKI295 cohort. These above analyses are consistent with our in vitro findings (Figure\u00a05A and B) suggesting that lower S100A2 expression is associated with the pro-tumorigenic effects of the type one interferon response within the breast cancer microenvironment.DiscussionThe tumor microenvironment has been recognized as a major player in the development and progression of solid tumors, including breast cancer. Recently, targeting immune cells within the tumor microenvironment has led to spectacular successes in the treatment of melanomas. The role of interferons in modulating the immune response to viruses is well known, but the role of interferons in modulating the immune response to tumors is less well defined. Early experimental models have uncovered potent direct cytotoxic and/or anti-proliferative effects of interferons, although the translation of these findings into their use as anti-cancer therapeutics has been met with only limited success in breast cancer and other carcinomas. In fact, there were even early indications that the administration of IFN-\u03b2 to cancer patients could lead to an increase in the number of hormone receptors in the cancerous tissue. More recently, the presence of aberrantly expressed IFN-related genes in cancer were first noticed in the initial molecular portraits of breast cancer. Later an IFN signature was observed in several human cancers; 15% of childhood lymphoblastic leukemias, 20% of ovarian and 40% of breast cancers were positive for an IFN-related signature.In the current study we have shown that a subset of breast CAFs (5 of 23 tested CAFs) strongly expresses a type one interferon response and that this response, chiefly through the IFN-\u03b2 cytokine, can impart a pro-proliferative effect on MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro. It should be noted that direct fibroblast-breast cancer cell line contact was necessary when the interferon response was previously induced artificially in vitro. We show that an interferon response is identifiable even after ex-vivo culturing in some CAFs grown alone, and that its pro-proliferative effect on co-cultured breast cancer cells is mediated through the action of soluble IFN-\u03b2 ligand. Our IFN response can be detected in whole breast tumors as an expression signature conveying poor prognosis. Additionally, we showed that S100A2 is a candidate mediator of the IFN response\u2019s effect on patient outcome. S100A2 is a calcium binding protein that has been repeatedly shown to be down regulated in a variety of cancers such as breast, and prostate and is considered to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene.In light of recent findings that interferon positivity correlates with a poor clinical outcome in breast cancer, it is probable that interferons may actually be pro-tumorigenic, as suggested also by our findings. Type one interferon signaling has also been correlated with resistance to doxorubicin and topoisomerase-II inhibitors in vitro and confer resistance to DNA damage in cancer cell lines. Taken together, this would suggest that type one interferon neutralization within the tumor microenvironment should be pursued in lieu of their supplementation at least in cases in which interferon signalling is active and detectable in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, on close inspection of the interferon response gene set we have identified there are many cytokines present (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6, CXCL10, CXCL11, IL6, IL8, CSF2, CCL11), any one of which could be mediating the phenotype seen herein.ConclusionWe have identified a subset of CAFs and perhaps breast tumors, which may be particularly vulnerable to such therapeutic approaches. These data will need to be further expanded to include in vivo models of human CAFs co-implanted with breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, these results provide a better understanding of the potential value of targeted anti-IFN-\u03b2 therapy in breast cancer patients whose tumors show a gene expression profile reflecting a type-one IFN response. Protein biomarkers such as S100A2, OAS2 and/or IFN\u03b2 RNA expression in breast tumors may prove to be useful guides in predicting the response of IFN-positive patients to anti-interferon therapeutics.Additional filesCompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors\u2019 contributionsANH: Conceived this study, designed and carried out experiments, analysed data and wrote the manuscript.

The well\u2011established dependency of cancer cells on their microenvironment suggests that targeting the tumor niche might form a novel therapeutic approach. We identified the tumor\u2011associated macrophage\u00a0(TAM) infiltration in breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry, and analyzed overall survival\u00a0(OS). U937 co\u2011cultures with MDA\u2011MB\u2011231, MDA\u2011MB\u2011468 and MCF\u20117, respectively, to simulate in\u00a0vivo cellular interactions were assessed. In hormone\u2011independent breast cancer cell conditioned media\u00a0(CM), U937 differentiates into M2 macrophage as identified by morphological changes and expression of specific surface antigens CD163 and CD204. Moreover, MDA\u2011MB\u2011231 recruits U937, and colony\u2011stimulating factor\u00a01\u00a0(CSF1) level in MDA\u2011MB\u2011231 and MDA\u2011MB\u2011468 CM is much higher than that of MCF\u20117. Overexpression of CSF1 in MCF\u20117 fails to rebuild its aggressiveness both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo since CSF1 was not found extracellularly, while genetic inhibition of CSF1 in MDA\u2011MB\u2011231 abrogates TAM infiltration and consequently reduces tumorigenesis in non\u2011obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient\u00a0(NOD/SCID) mice. Using various strategies we demonstrate that CSF1\u2011induced TAMs specifically support breast cancer progression. Importantly, our results may reveal the efficacy of using targeted therapy against tumor niche and indicate that CSF1 inhibition may limit some breast cancer progression.",

        "content": "It is widely recognized that stromal fibroblasts significantly influence biological properties of multiple tumors including breast cancer. However, these epithelial-mesenchymal interactions seem to be essential in tumor biology and it is not fully clear whether this interaction is tumor type-specific or has a more general non-specific character. To elucidate this question, we tested the effect of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from different types of tumors (breast cancer skin metastasis, cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma arising from oral cavity mucous membrane) on the EM-G3 breast cancer cell line. The results were compared with control experiments using normal human dermal fibroblasts, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and 3T3 fibroblasts influenced by the fibroblasts prepared from the basal cell carcinoma. Our results demonstrated that expression of luminal marker keratin 8 was influenced only by CAFs prepared from any tested tumors. In contrast, all tested types of fibroblasts showed a strong stimulatory effect on the expression of basal/myoepithelial marker keratin 14. The CAFs also elevated the number of cells with positivity for both keratins 8 and 14 that are similar to ductal originated precursor cells. The expression of proliferation marker Ki67 was not influenced by any of the tested fibroblasts. In conclusion, our data indicate that CAFs are able to influence the phenotype of a breast cancer cell line and this effect is based on a tumor type-unspecific mechanism. Finally, a clear functional difference between normal and CAFs was demonstrated.",

Journal of Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.IntroductionCarcinomas are composed of neoplastic cells admixed with many types of supportive cells, which constitute the tumour stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant cell type within cancer stroma, play significant roles in overall breast cancer development and spread. Genetic and epigenetic changes activate stromal fibroblasts, which then escort cancer cells throughout the whole carcinogenic process in a paracrine manner. Indeed, activated fibroblasts secrete high levels of various growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases such as the MMPs, which are used to communicate with cancer cells as well as with other stromal cells. CAFs exhibit some important features of neoplastic cells and have been shown to promote carcinogenesis both in vitro and in animal models. High numbers of active stromal fibroblasts are often associated with high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis. Furthermore, CAFs were shown to play major roles in drug resistance and tumour recurrence.Surgery is considered the first line of treatment for most breast tumours. During lumpectomy, the tumour is removed with some normal surrounding tissues (surgical margins) to ensure the removal of all tumour cells and to minimize local recurrence. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that surgical margin status influences the risk of local recurrence. Recurrences arise most frequently in the tumour bed. Thereby, radiotherapy is usually applied as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of relapse. Furthermore, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) was also used and yielded very low recurrence rates when given as a boost. Importantly, TARGIT impaired the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding. This may be due to the immediate effect of radiation on the local tumour microenvironment, making it less favourable for tumour growth and progression. This suggests that cancer may recur following breast conserving surgery due to residual unresected tumour or to the presence of active stromal cells, or both. In fact, even in tumour-free tissues, the microenvironment could still play a capital role in tumour development/recurrence. Indeed, it has been recently shown that breast cancers with higher mean stiffness values at shear-wave elastography, which is related to the surrounding stroma rather than to the cancer itself, had poorer prognostic features. Therefore, we sought to undergo molecular and cellular characterization of breast stromal fibroblasts from negative surgical margins. We show that these cells exhibit a specific gene expression profile and are procarcinogenic.Materials and methodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblasts were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients under Research Ethical Committee Project No. RAC#2031091. CAFs were derived from tumour areas of the samples, while TCFs were developed from histologically normal tissues located at least 2 cm away from tumours (invasive ductal carcinomas). Processing of tissues was performed after routine examination by a certified anatomical pathologist, using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Normal fibroblasts (NBFs) and epithelial cells (NLECs) were derived from healthy age-matched females who underwent breast reduction surgery. In the present experiments, NBFs, CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, under the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). NLEC cells were cultured in universal medium [1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10\u20138 m choleratoxin, 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium), 0.4 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone, 2 \u00d7 10\u20139 m T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and 5 mg/ml oestrogen, and were used at passage 2. MCF-7 and MCF-10 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), except for antibiotic/antimycotics and ITS, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cells cultured in medium with serum, whilst serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was obtained from cells cultured in the absence of serum. In both cases, the cells were cultured for 24 h before the media were collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.Affymetrix exon array and data analysis; quantitative RT\u2013PCRExon array protocols are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. Quantitative RT\u2013PCR was conducted as described previously. All reactions were performed in triplicate and the data analysed using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. The respective primers are presented in Supplementary materials and methods.Cell proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with SFCM and incubated for different time intervals (0, 24 and 48 h). Cell proliferation was measured by the tetrazolium salt colorimetric assay, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) after incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The amount of formazan was quantified at 450 nm.Immunoblotting, cytokine array and ELISAImmunoblotting of total cell protein lysates was performed as previously described. Antibodies are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. SFCMs from CAF, TCF and NBF cells were applied to a RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody array (RayBiotech Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems; or RayBiotech for MMP-2). These experiments were performed in triplicate.Chemotaxis and invasion assayInvasion chambers (24-well) were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines (BD Bioscience); 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells were added to the upper wells, separated by an 8 \u00b5m pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with Diff Quick (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane, using Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using a light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification \u00d740). Each assay was performed in triplicate.Orthotopic tumour xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH & RC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Fifteen female nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper, using the formula: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsSurgical margin stromal fibroblasts exhibit a specific gene expression profileTo identify the molecular changes that can take place in breast stromal fibroblasts from surgical margins, gene expression profiles of five paired CAFs/TCFs as well as three NBFs were examined. Total RNA was extracted and genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed, using Affymetrix's GeneChip\u00ae Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (HE 1.0 STAs). Three different comparisons were performed: TCFs with CAFs; TCFs with NBFs; and CAFs with NBFs. p < 0.05 and a threshold of absolute fold change \u2264 2 \u2265 was considered a significant difference in the analysis of the microarray data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed 804 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TCF, CAF and NBF cells. The unsupervised two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical clustering revealed a clear pattern of gene expression, defining three main transcriptome clusters corresponding to TCFs, CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A).Differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Total RNA from five CAFs, their corresponding TCFs as well as three NBFs was used to perform genome-wide gene expression analysis. (A) Unsupervised 2D hierarchical clustering of significantly varying genes across the three groups was performed using Pearson's correlation with average linkage clustering (only the top 112 of the most significantly dysregulated genes are shown for readability). (B) The three dominant PCA components that contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix clearly distinguished samples as CAF, TCF and NBF. (C) Venn diagram showing differential gene expression between the groups. (D) qRT\u2013PCR data for the indicated genes (mean \u00b1 SD)Unsupervised principle components analysis (PCA), which contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix, further showed the presence of three distinct groups (Figure 1B). Intriguingly, the TCF samples clustered closer to CAF cells than to NBFs. Moreover, the gene expression variability was highest for the TCF group (Figure 1B). Next, Venn diagram analysis was performed, with the significance of overlaps calculated using hypergeometric distributional assumption and p values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This comparison approach revealed a significant overlap between TCFs and CAFs as compared to the two other comparisons (p < 10\u20135) (Figure 1C). Indeed, among the three comparisons, the least number of DEGs was between CAFs versus TCFs, with only 42 DEGs (Figure 1C). On the other hand, the number of DEGs between CAFs and NBFs reached 101 (Figure 1C). Comparing TCF with NBF, we found 77 DEGs, 25 of which were also differentially expressed between CAFs and NBFs, while the levels of 49 genes were uniquely dysregulated in TCFs as compared to NBFs and CAFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that TCF cells present in surgical margins exhibit specific gene expression patterns relative to their corresponding CAFs and also normal breast fibroblasts.Quantitative RT\u2013PCR validation of gene expression resultsTo validate the RNA microarray analysis, we performed quantitative RT\u2013PCR on nine genes: MMP-3, ITGB8, SFRP4, ITGBP7, ADAMTS1, CTGF, PTGS, SDHC and CCL-2. Figure 1D shows differential expression of all these genes between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. These results confirm the presence of differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokinesNext, we assessed the level of secreted pro-carcinogenic cytokines from CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Therefore, CAF-114, TCF-114 and NBF-6 were cultured to 80% confluency and then complete medium (CpM) was replaced with serum-free medium (SFM). Serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was collected after 48 h of incubation and applied to the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody array map. The array showed differential levels of various cytokines between TCF, CAF and NBF cells (Figure 2A). Upon quantification and normalization against the positive controls probed on the membrane, it was clear that CAFs secreted the highest levels of the majority of these cytokines (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the levels of SDF-1, CCL-25, TIMP-1 and TNF-alfa were also higher in TCF-114 cells than in NBF cells (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained when comparing CAF-180, TCF-180 and NBF-1 (data not shown). This shows that TCFs, although present in histologically normal parts of the breast, secrete high levels of various pro-carcinogenic cytokines.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokines. SFCMs from the indicated cells were collected and applied on the human cytokine antibody array map. (A) Cytokine array maps highlighting the differentially expressed cytokines. (B) Quantification of the array data for selected cytokines. (C) SFCMs were used to assess the levels of the indicated proteins by ELISA in CAF/TCF pairs from three patients compared to NBF-6 (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005)TCFs secrete high levels of SDF-1, VEGF-A and IL-6To further show the variation in cytokine secretion, SFCMs were collected from three different CAFs and their corresponding TCFs (87, 180 and 142) and NBF-6, and were used to assess the levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A by ELISA. Figure 2C shows that CAF cells secreted the highest levels of the three cytokines. Interestingly, the secreted levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A were also higher in all TCFs compared to NBF-6 (8.2-, 4.2- and 25-fold higher, respectively) (Figure 2C). Figure 2C also shows inter-patient variation in the secreted levels of these important pro-carcinogenic factors. These results confirm that TCF cells secrete higher levels of pro-carcinogenic factors relative to normal breast fibroblasts.TCF cells from surgical margins exhibit features of active fibroblastsTo test whether fibroblasts from surgical margins display features of activation, we examined the levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 (two major markers of active breast fibroblasts) by immunoblotting. Interestingly, like CAF cells, TCFs also express higher levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 than NBF-6 and NBF-1 (Figure 3A). However, while the level of \u03b1-SMA was similar in TCFs and their corresponding CAFs, SDF-1 levels were slightly higher in CAF cells as compared to their respective TCFs (Figure 3A). Next, we studied the migratory and invasiveness abilities of TCF cells, using chambers either coated with Matrigel (invasion) or uncoated (migration). While CpM was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers, cells (4 \u00d7 105) were added to the upper wells in serum-free medium for 24 h. Figure 3B shows that while NBF-1 and NBF-6 cells were unable to migrate, TCF-87 and TCF-180 cells showed invasiveness and migratory abilities. However, the number of invading and migrating TCF cells was lower than that of their corresponding CAF cells (Figure 3B). This provides further evidence that TCF cells display active fibroblast features.TCFs are active fibroblasts. (A) Immunoblotting for \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 of the indicated cell lysates. (B) Invasion/migration assays. The numbers of invaded/migrated cells are presented in the histogram (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005 for TCFs compared to NBF-1 and NBF-6; note that CAFs are also significantly different)Surgical margin fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of non-cancerous epithelial cellsTo further show the active state of TCF cells, we studied their paracrine effect on the proliferation of epithelial cells. SFCMs collected from CAF/TCF-142, -180, -87 and \u2212114 pairs and from NBF-6 and NBF-1 were used for culturing non-cancerous MCF10A epithelial cells. Proliferation of MCF10A cells was higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF and TCF cells, compared to NBF cells. TCFs showed an intermediate effect between CAFs and NBFs (Figure 4). Indeed, after 24 h of incubation, SFCMs from TCF-87 and CAF-87 enhanced cell proliferation two- and four-fold, respectively, compared to SFCM from NBF cells (Figure 4). Similar results were obtained with CAF/TCF-180 and \u2212142 pairs (Figure 4). For CAF/TCF-114, both enhanced the proliferation of MCF10A by four-fold at 24 h of incubation (Figure 4). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs also enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner.TCF-conditioned medium enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. MCF10A cells were cultured in SFCMs from the indicated fibroblasts from four patients and proliferation measured at the indicated times using the WST-1 assay, compared to SFCMs from the two NBF cultures performed at the same time. Error bars represent \u00b1 SDTCFs promote migration/invasion and induce mesenchymal features of breast cancer cellsWe next investigated the effect of TCF cells on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. SFCMs collected from TCF-180, CAF-180 and NBF-6 were added to MCF-7 cells (105) that had previously been seeded in the upper compartments of migration/invasion plates. Figure 5A shows that the number of migrated MCF-7 cells was much higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF-180 and TCF-180 than with NBF-6 cells or SFM (used as negative control). Figure 5A shows that SFCMs from both CAF-180 and TCF-180 enhanced about 73-fold the migration ability of these breast cancer cells as compared to NBF-6.TCF cells enhance the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells and promote EMT. (A) SCFMs from the indicated cells were added into the lower compartments of 24-well BD BioCoat plates. MCF-7 cells (105) were seeded onto the upper compartment of the plates and incubated for 24 h. The numbers of invaded and migrated cells are presented (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005). (B, C) MCF-7 or normal luminal epithelial cells (NLEC) were treated with the indicated SFCMs for 24 h and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodiesNext, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism/pathway that underlies TCF-dependent increase in the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we explored the paracrine effect of TCF cells on the phosphorylation/activation of Akt, a known pro-invasive protein kinase. Epithelial MCF-7 cells were treated with SFM or SFCM from TCF-180 and CAF-180 for 24 h. Figure 5B shows that SFCMs from TCF and CAF cells increased the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt, with no effect on the level of total protein. Since active Akt and the increase in the invasiveness/migratory abilities of breast cancer cells accompany the transition of these epithelial cells to the mesenchymal phenotype, we assessed the level of N-cadherin and Snail and showed that SFCM from TCF cells increased the level of these two important markers of mesenchymal cells (Figure 5B). On the other hand, the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were markedly reduced (Figure 5B). These results indicate that, like CAFs, TCF cells have the ability to trigger the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process.TCF cells activate Akt and up-regulate PCNA and MMP-2 in normal luminal cells in a paracrine mannerSince TCFs are present in histologically normal parts of the breast, we sought to investigate their effect on primary normal luminal epithelial cells (NLECs). Therefore, NLECs were incubated for 24 h with SFCMs from TCF, CAF and NBF, and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting. Figure 5C shows increase in the level of the proliferation marker PCNA in luminal cells pretreated with SFCMs from CAF and TCF cells, with a higher effect of CAF cells (Figure 5C). Similarly, the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt and also MMP-2 increased under the paracrine effect of TCF and CAF cells (Figure 5C). This shows that, like CAF cells, TCFs have the ability to promote tumourigenesis in normal luminal epithelial cells.TCFs stimulate breast cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse modelTo investigate the effect of fibroblasts on tumour growth in vivo, 15 nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer tumours were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. All mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and CAF-180 cells developed tumours. On the other hand, while two of five mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and TCF-180 cells had tumours, only one mouse co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and NBF-6 cells developed a tumour (Figure 6A). Importantly, this tumour appeared 29 days post-injection, while tumours containing TCF and CAF cells appeared only 15 days after implantation (Figure 6B). Furthermore, at 40 days post-injection, while the size of the tumour containing NBF-6 cells reached a volume of 1.4 cm3, the tumours containing TCF and CAF cells reached 4 cm3 and 7 cm3 on average, respectively (Figure 6A, B). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs have the ability to promote tumour formation and growth compared to normal fibroblasts.TCFs enhance the formation and the growth of human breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice. Breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells under the nipples of nude mice. (A) Tumour size 40 days post-injection. (B) Time-dependent tumour growth (mean \u00b1 SD)DiscussionWe have shown here that breast stromal fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins exhibit a specific gene expression pattern compared to cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal breast fibroblasts, with 77 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and NBFs and 42 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and their paired CAFs. Intriguingly, the expression pattern of 49 genes was specific for TCF cells, as compared to CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues around tumours may also be affected by the presence of tumour cells. Notably, the genes that were found differentially expressed uniquely in TCFs were enriched with biological processes and functions related to, among others, inflammatory response, response to stimulus, immune cell trafficking, tissue development and cell signalling (see Supplementary material, Figure S1A, Table S2). To elucidate how these deregulated genes are interacting with genes in various metabolic pathways, the DEGs were mapped to gene networks using the ingenuity knowledge base. The network analysis revealed the potentially important role of CCL13, CTGF, CYP1B1, IGFBP7 and B4GALT1 (see Supplementary material, Figure S1B). Interestingly, genes deregulated in TCF cells interact, directly or indirectly, with the UBC gene (see Supplementary material, Figure S1C), which plays an essential role in maintaining ubiquitin levels, especially under stress conditions. Indeed, this polyubiquitin gene is up-regulated by cellular stresses and contains classical heat-shock elements in its promoter, suggesting that stress-related factors are involved in the TCF-specific gene expression profile and may relate to evidence that cancer cells use oxidative stress to activate adjacent fibroblasts. Comparing the variation in gene expression in each cell type showed variability within the three categories of cells. Interestingly, the gene expression profiles of TCF cells were more heterogeneous than those of CAF and NBF cells (Figure 1C), indicating higher patient-to-patient variability in stromal fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues.Differential gene expression between CAF and TCF cells from breast tumours has been reported previously. Bauer et al found 37 genes differentially expressed between six paired TCFs and CAFs and have also shown higher gene expression variability in TCF than in CAF cells. In another study, 420 genes were found to be differentially expressed between CAFs and normal breast fibroblasts from mammoplasties (NBFs). Similarly, we have shown here that the expression of 101 genes varied between CAF and NBF cells. However, the current study presents the first micro-array comparative analysis between surgical margin fibroblasts, their corresponding CAFs and NBFs. In addition, we have shown that fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins have higher migratory/invasiveness abilities than normal breast fibroblasts. Furthermore, these cells enhanced the proliferation rate of non-carcinogenic epithelial cells and the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as the formation/growth of breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice (Figures 5, 6). Interestingly, like CAFs, TCFs induced features of mesenchymal cells in breast cancer cells. Moreover, TCFs up-regulated PCNA and MMP2 and activated Akt in normal breast luminal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. This indicates that these cells have the ability to promote cancer development and progression. This effect could be mediated through secretion of cytokines and/or energy transfer mechanisms (reverse Warburg effect).Notably, the magnitude of all these TCF-related effects was intermediate between those of CAFs and NBFs. This shows that, despite their localization in histologically normal breast tissues and not being in direct contact with cancer cells, TCFs acquired some myofibroblast features, suggesting that cancer cells can affect not only cancer-associated fibroblasts but also fibroblasts present in cancer-free adjacent tissues. This effect could be mediated through secreted molecules able to diffuse from cancer cells through normal tissue, reaching distant cells. TGF\u03b2 could play an important role in this effect. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 can induce the production of \u03b1-SMA in mammary fibroblasts in vitro and consequently transdifferentiates fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. It is also possible that cancer cells activate adjacent fibroblasts through the aerobic glycolysis process (Warburg effect), which produces pyruvate and lactate. Indeed, treatment with lactate transport inhibitor prevented the conversion of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts.Our data indicate that remaining active fibroblasts following resection may enhance the chances of tumour recurrence, since these cells may constitute a fertile soil for tumour growth. To date, the most appropriate amount of normal breast tissue that should be removed to minimize local recurrence remains controversial. However, it is well known that local recurrence in patients submitted to conservative surgery is more common than in patients treated by mastectomy, showing the importance of surgical margins status for local relapse. Furthermore, several publications have reported the importance of the pathological margin status in determining the risk of local recurrence after breast conserving therapy. In conclusion, the present data show that breast stromal fibroblasts localized in cancer-free surgical margins are active and hence can potentiate the carcinogenesis process, and indicate that the tumour microenvironment may play determinant roles in local recurrence. Therefore, in the era of personalized therapy, the status of tumour stroma should also be taken into consideration for more efficient treatment and the prevention of recurrence as well as metastasis.Author contributionsMAA, S-FH and AAl performed experiments and analysed the data; FA performed experiments on the mice; DC and NK performed the micro-array data analysis; OA provided the tissues; AA supervised the work and analysed the data; and DC and AA wrote the paper.

        "content": "The tumor microenvironment plays pivotal roles in promotion of many malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been well-known to promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis but mechanistic understanding of tumor-stroma interactions is not yet complete. Recently, estrogen synthetic enzymes were reported to be upregulated by co-culture with stromal cells in ER positive breast carcinoma (BC) but effects of co-culture on androgen metabolism have not been extensively examined. Therefore, we evaluated roles of CAFs on androgen metabolism in ER-negative AR-positive BC through co-culture with CAFs. Concentrations of steroid hormone in supernatant of co-culture of MDA-MB-453 and primary CAFs were measured using GC-MS. Cytokines derived from CAFs were determined using Cytokine Array. Expressions of androgen synthetic enzymes were confirmed using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Correlations between CAFs and androgen synthetic enzymes were analyzed using triple-negative BC (TNBC) patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. CAFs were demonstrated to increase expressions and activities of 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1. IL-6 and HGF that were selected as potential paracrine mediators using cytokine array induced 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1 expression. Underlying mechanisms of IL-6 paracrine regulation of 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 could be partially dependent on phosphorylated STAT3, while phosphorylated ERK could be involved in HGF-mediated 5\u03b1-Reductase1 induction. \u03b1-SMA status was also demonstrated to be significantly correlated with 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 status in TNBC tissues, especially AR-positive cases. Results of our present study suggest that both IL-6 and HGF derived from CAFs could contribute to the intratumoral androgen metabolism in ER-negative BC patients.",

This might be a common mechanism for acquiring metastatic potential in breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, tumours with the same clinical and pathological status may differ in metastatic potential, and therefore lead to different prognoses. Metastasis of breast cancer cells requires decreased cell\u2013cell adhesion, but increased cell\u2013extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, and enhanced invasiveness and motility via secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes and cytoskeletal reorganisation. A well-recognised mechanism for initiating tumour cell invasive and metastatic behaviour is epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which polarised epithelial breast cancer cells acquire a motile mesenchymal phenotype. However, the common mechanisms of induction of metastasis in breast cancers with different biological characteristics remain undefined. A better understanding of such mechanisms could lead to find universal molecular targets for anti-metastasis therapy.The metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is closely dependent on the tumour microenvironment. The fibroblast is the predominant stromal cell type in tumour microenvironment of heterogeneous breast cancer tissues. Tumour cells activate stromal fibroblast cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through the stimulation of paracrine growth factors, and CAFs are more effective than normal stromal fibroblasts in promoting the cell survival, growth and progression of cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts secrete a number of growth factors, including transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), which is a strong extracellular signal regulating EMT in cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts also secrete chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)/stromal derived factor1 (SDF-1) to induce EMT of cancer cells. In addition, ECM, the non-cellular composition of the tumour microenvironment, is mainly synthesised by CAFs. It functions as a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells through ECM remodelling by ECM-degrading proteases secreted from cancer cells with the EMT phenotype.There is a consensus that CAFs can affect the metastatic behaviour of breast cancer cells. However, it is unclear how CAFs affect the metastatic potential of breast cancers with different biological characteristics. In the present study, we demonstrated that CAFs could enhance the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells with different characteristics through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Different EMT programmes were activated in different breast cancer cells because of the different responses to CAF paracrine extracellular signalling.Materials and MethodsIsolation and culture of stromal fibroblastsTo isolate stromal fibroblasts, primary cancer tissues were obtained from three female breast cancer patients at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH; Tianjin, China). These patients had undergone mastectomy but had not been treated with preoperative chemotherapy. The tissue specimens were divided into three parts for histopathological diagnosis, mRNA and protein extraction and isolation of stromal fibroblasts. The investigation and the use of specimens were approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH and written consent was obtained from participants.The breast cancer tissue specimens used for isolation of stromal fibroblasts were diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma with histological grade II and classified as luminal A subtype with oestrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative. Importantly, the specimens were assessed by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) to confirm that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells in the heterogeneous cancer tissue (Figure 1A and B).The fresh tissues were sliced and digested with 160\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 collagenase A (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and 25\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009h. Then the cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) until cells grew into a confluent monolayer. After 2\u20133 passages, a unique homogeneity of stromal fibroblasts was formed. All the stromal fibroblasts used in the experiments were at less than 10 passages. To prepare conditioned medium of cultured CAFs (CAF-CM) for breast cancer cell treatments, stromal fibroblasts isolated from three tissue specimens were mixed and cultured for 48\u2009h, then collected and centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 5000\u2009r.p.m. to remove cell debris.Culture of breast cancer cell linesBreast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, each with different biological characteristics and metastatic potential, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) or DMEM/F12 (T47D) medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100\u2009units per ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells in logarithmic growth phase or at 80% confluence were used for experiments. Breast cancer cell lines were treated with the CM of stromal fibroblasts, diluted with an equal volume of fresh medium for 2 days. An equal volume of complete culture medium was used as the control.Cell\u2013ECM adhesion assayBreast cancer cells were plated in Matrigel-coated 12-well plates at 1 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The non-adherent cells were counted after being cultured for the appropriate time and the percentage of adherent cells was calculated as (1\u2013non-adherent cells/total inoculated cells) \u00d7 100%.Wound-healing assayBreast cancer cells were plated in six-well plates at 5 \u00d7 105 cells per well to grow into a monolayer. A linear scratch/wound was made on cell monolayers with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs were taken of live cells at \u00d7 100 magnification and the distance migrated was observed within an appropriate time.Cell migration and invasion assayThe invasion and migration abilities of breast cancer cells in vitro were evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). 5 \u00d7 104 cells in 500\u2009\u03bcl serum-free medium were added to the upper chamber, and medium containing 20% FBS was added into the lower chamber. The cells were left to invade the Matrigel for the appropriate time, the non-invading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by wiping, and the invading cells were fixed and stained with a three-step stain set kit (Richard-Allan Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The number of invading or migrating cells was counted under a microscope in five predetermined fields for each membrane at \u00d7 400 magnification.TGF-\u03b2 signalling analysisBreast cancer cells were cultured with CM of stromal fibroblasts containing 50\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 TGF-\u03b21 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to neutralise TGF-\u03b21, or 1.0\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009ml\u22121 SB-431542 (Sigma) to block the TGF-\u03b2 signalling of breast cancer cells.Reverse transcription-quantitative PCRTotal RNA of tissues or cultured cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using a First-strand cDNA Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We quantified the transcripts of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal mRNA quantity control, as previously described. All primers and TaqMan probes for cDNA amplification of various target genes were designed and optimised using Oligo 6.0 software (Molecular Biology Insights, West Cascade, USA), and synthesised by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services (Shanghai, China). Triplicate quantitative PCR reactions were performed for both target genes and the housekeeping gene using Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative expression level of the target gene was calculated by normalising the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the target gene to the Ct values of GAPDH (\u0394Ct), and determined as 2\u2212\u0394Ct.ImmunohistochemistryBreast cancer cells growing on sterile coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue specimens were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemistry staining of specimens was carried out using the primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4; DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark), anti-Vimentin (V9; Invitrogen) and anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7; Invitrogen); the secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used at appropriate concentration. Staining was performed with diaminobenzidine; hematoxylin was used for counterstaining.ImmunoblottingHarvested cells were lysed with protein lysis buffer containing 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5\u2009mM EDTA acid, 1% Triton X-100, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% dithiothreitol and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The proteins in the lysate were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The primary antibodies used were anti-Vimentin, anti-E-cadherin, anti-TGF-\u03b2RII (K105; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA), anti-Smad2 (86F7; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-pSmad2 (Phospho-Ser245/250/255; Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20091000, \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20093000, and the secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20092500. The protein blotting on the membranes was performed as previously described. The immunoreactive protein bands on the membranes were visualised using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare).Immunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on the coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009min. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15\u2009min, washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained using DAPI permamount. The protein expression was visualised using a fluorescence microscope.Cytokine antibody array analysisThe TGF\u03b2s secreted from CAFs were analysed using a Cytokine Antibody Array (R&D Systems) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, membranes were incubated with 1.0\u2009ml of CAF-CM at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted biotin-conjugated antibodies were added to each membrane, which was then incubated at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to each membrane and incubated at room temperature for 2\u2009h. The membranes were placed into the mixed Detection Buffer and exposed to X-ray film. The intensities of signals were quantified by ScanAlyze software (Michael Eisen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA). A positive control was used to normalise the results from the different membranes being compared. All samples were performed in duplicates.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation. Student's t-test and rank sum test were used to compare the differences between the experimental group and control group. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.ResultsThe stromal fibroblasts isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibit characteristics of CAFsTo characterise stromal fibroblasts in the microenvironment of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from primary breast cancer tissues. In the primary breast cancer tissue, we observed that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells (Figure 1A), and some of them were active fibroblasts with positive \u03b1-SMA staining (Figure 1B). The stromal cells separated from primary breast cancer tissues were a heterogeneous mixture of a variety of cells in the primary culture, with fibroblasts being the main component. After passaging the primary culture cells, uniform fibroblasts started to grow (Figure 1C). The stromal fibroblasts showed positive staining for the mesenchymal marker vimentin (Figure 1D) and negative staining for the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Figure 1E). In particular, they expressed the activated myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA (Figure 1F) and CXCL12 (Supplementary Figure 1A). These results indicated that the isolated and cultured fibroblasts in vitro from breast cancer tissues maintained the features of CAFs.To investigate whether the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro are retained features of CAFs, we detected the expression of E-cadherin, \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 in CAFs at different low passages. The results showed that the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 were similar in all the CAFs at different passages, and E-cadherin was not expressed in any CAFs at different passages (Supplementary Figure 1B and C), which indicated that the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro retained the features of CAFs.CAFs enhanced aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cellsTo investigate the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cells with different intrinsic characteristics, the CAF-CM was collected and used to culture breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231. The epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells cultured with CAF-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering. The mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells cultured with CAF-CM were also changed to more fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 2A). All the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM had enhanced cell\u2013ECM adhesion (Figure 2B), migration (Figure 2C\u2013E) and invasion (Figure 2F and G) compared with the control cells. All the above results suggested that CAF-secreted proteins could stimulate these different breast cancer cell lines to change their morphologies and phenotypes to have more metastatic potential.CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cellsTo investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by CAF-CM in breast cancer cell lines, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1), mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM) and fibronectin 1 (FN1), as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with CAF-CM. Results showed that cells cultured with CAF-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in MCF-7 and T47D cells, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3A and C). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker VIM, FN1, MMP2 and MMP9 were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM (Figure 3B and D). These results indicated that factors secreted by CAFs could induce the EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.To investigate whether EMT programming was activated by CAF-secreted factors in these breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics, the expression of EMT-related transcription factors (EMT-TFs) snail homolog 1 (SNAI1), SNAI2, twist basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix transcription factor 1 (TWIST1) and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was measured in breast cancer cell lines cultured with CAF-CM. The results showed that SNAI1 expression levels were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM, SNAI2 expression levels were upregulated in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells but not in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells, TWIST1 expression levels were upregulated in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells but not in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells, and ZEB1 expression levels were upregulated only in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3E). These results indicated that CAF-secreted proteins induced the EMT phenotype through common and/or unique activation of EMT-TFs in breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics.CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling in breast cancer cells via CAF-secreted TGF-\u03b21As TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer, we examined whether CAFs secreted any TGF isoform into CAF-CM. Our results showed that CAFs secreted significantly more TGF-\u03b21 than TGF-\u03b22 or TGF-\u03b23 (Figure 4A). We then compared the mRNA expression of the TGF-\u03b21-coding gene TGFB1 in CAFs and breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that TGFB1 expression levels were significantly higher in CAFs than those in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 was mainly secreted by the CAFs in the co-culture of CAFs with breast cancer cells.To investigate the effect of CAF-CM on activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling in breast cancer cell lines, we compared the expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 receptor type II (TGF-\u03b2RII), total Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad2 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CM or control medium. The results showed that CAF-CM significantly increased phosphorylated Smad2 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, whereas total Smad2 was not affected. Although TGF-\u03b2RII expression levels were different in the three cell lines, they were not affected by culturing with CAF-CM (Figure 4C). Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 secretion by breast cancer cells was not affected neither (Figure 4D). These results indicate that CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling pathway in breast cancer cells mainly through paracrine TGF-\u03b21.EMT programming and phenotype were reversed by blocking TGF-\u03b21 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CMTo further test the role of TGF-\u03b21 signalling in EMT phenotype changes of breast cancer cells, TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody and TGF-\u03b2 signalling blocking reagent SB-431542 were added to CAF-CM for culturing epithelial cells MCF-7 and mesenchymal-like cells MDA-MB-231. Then, the expression of epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers and EMT-TFs were examined. After culturing in CAF-CM, the E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells was reduced, and vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was increased. Moreover, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5A). Similarly, the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was also reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5B). Consistent with the effects of TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody, adding SB-431542 in CAF-CM also reversed the reduced E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM (Figure 5C), as well as the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the enhanced abilities of migration and invasion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding anti-TGF-\u03b21 antibody (Figure 5E and F). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 secreted from CAFs was an important regulator for activation of EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.DiscussionIsolation of stromal fibroblasts from invasive cancer tissues followed by low-passaged cultures in vitro is the main approach to investigate the biological characteristics of CAFs and their effects on tumour cells. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin is commonly used as a marker of myofibroblast formation to identify CAFs, and its expression is higher in fibroblasts derived from cancer tissues than in those derived from normal tissues. Evidence has shown that stromal fibroblasts isolated from cancer tissues such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer retain the characteristics of CAFs, with high levels of \u03b1-SMA expression. As luminal A is the most common subtype of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from invasive luminal A subtype breast cancer tissues, and confirmed that the fibroblasts expressed high levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12/SDF-1, which is a typical characteristic of CAFs. Moreover, CAFs at low passages cultured in vitro retained their original features, which was consistent with the Kalluri's report.There have been reports that CAFs could promote aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cells.) demonstrated that downregulation of p16INK4A transformed normal breast fibroblasts into CAFs, which in turn enhanced migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner.) showed that CAFs enhanced migration by promoting EMT of PMC42-LA cells.) found that CAFs promoted EMT of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells, including luminal cells (MCF-7), basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) and cells with both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial characteristics (PMC42-LA). In this study, we demonstrated that factors secreted by CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviours of cell\u2013ECM adhesion, migration and invasion in both luminal (MCF-7 and T47D) and basal-like (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells by inducing or promoting EMT. This suggests that CAF-induced EMT might be the common mechanism underlying the acquisition of metastatic potential in different breast cancer subtypes.EMT enables cancer cells to acquire the ability to complete various steps in the metastatic cascade, and this change in phenotype of epithelial cancer cells is induced by paracrine signals from their microenvironment. It is known that CAFs can induce or promote EMT in a variety of cancers, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not clear. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer. Tumour cells can induce and maintain the EMT phenotype through autocrine secretion of TGF-\u03b2, and can also transform stromal fibroblasts into CAFs by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Although CAFs can also secrete TGF-\u03b2, it is little known whether or how CAF-paracrine TGF-\u03b2 induces EMT in tumour cells. By detection of the CAF-CM collected from CAFs cultured in vitro, we found that TGF-\u03b21 was the major TGF-\u03b2 family member secreted by CAFs. We also found that TGF-\u03b21 was expressed by CAFs significantly more than by cancer cells, and stimulation of CAF-paracrine factors did not significantly increase expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b2RII in the breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, by using a pharmacological inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase to inhibit the receptors of tumour cells, and neutralising antibodies to inhibit secreted TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs, we found that TGF-\u03b21, mainly secreted by CAFs, could induce EMT in different subtypes of breast cancers.Interestingly, we found that CAF-paracrine signalling induced EMT in breast cancer cells with different characteristics are underlying common and/or unique pleiotropically acting EMT-TFs. SNAI1 was activated by CAF-CM in the three breast cancer cell lines: epithelial/luminal A cells MCF-7 and T47D, and mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells MDA-MB-231. SNAI2 and ZEB1 were activated in epithelial/luminal A cells (SNAI2 in both MCF-7 and T47D, ZEB1 only in MCF-7) but not in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231). TWIST1 was activated in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) but not in epithelial cells/luminal A cells (MCF-7 and T47D). This novel observation indicates that different EMT programmes are activated in different subtypes of breast cancer cells specific to their responses to CAF-paracrine signalling. Another interesting finding in our in vitro experiments is that exogenous TGF-\u03b2 alone did not promote EMT of breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, although TGF-\u03b2 is a key modulator secreted by CAFs for promoting EMT of breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics, it needs co-factors to facilitate this process, and the exact mechanism remains to be further explored.In summary, CAFs could stimulate morphological and phenotypic changes in various breast cancer subtype cells to enhance their metastatic potential through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. This might be a common mechanism for metastasis among breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on British Journal of Cancer website (http://www.nature.com/bjc)This work is published under the standard license to publish agreement.

IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The SUM-159 human triple negative cell line was obtained from Asterand Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA) and was cultured in HAMS:F12 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone 1% HEPES. The MCF7 luminal A human breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 10% FBS. Cell lines were authenticated via third party testing (IDEXX BioAnalytics, Columbia, MO, USA) between October 2018 and October 2019. The MCF10A cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 5% FBS + 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was obtained from Dr. Ann Chambers (London Health Science Centre, London, Canada) and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS. The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and bone marrow (BM) was immediately extracted and stained with primary anti-CD117-PE and anti-CD45-FITC antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Supplemental Figure S2.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and either formalin-fixed or snap-frozen. (a\u2013g) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and stained with (a\u2013c) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or (e\u2013g) subjected to immunohistochemistry with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification for the presence of metastatic tumor cells (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a,e) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (b,f) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (c,g) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. (d) Positive control; MCF7 primary human breast tumor tissue. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels (a\u2013c) and top panels (d\u2013g) and high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels (a\u2013c) and bottom panels (d\u2013g). (h) DNA was isolated from snap-frozen lung tissue from tumor-na\u00efve control mice, MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and SUM159 tumor-bearing mice (n = 15/group) and subjected to qPCR analysis using primers specific to the human ALU sequence.Expression of the premetastatic niche markers fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 is enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, lungs were harvested and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against murine fibronectin (FN) (a,e,i); tenascin-c (TNC) (b,f,j); periostin (POSTN) (c,g,k) or MMP9 (d,h,l) prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/lung/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a\u2013d) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (e\u2013h) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (i\u2013l) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and snap-frozen. RNA was isolated from lungs and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis to assess the expression of murine fibronectin (a), tenascin-c (b), periostin (c), MMP9 (d), collegen A1 (e), LOX (f) and CCL2 (g) (n = 15 mice/group). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. \u03b1 = significantly different from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls. \u03b2 = significantly different from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.005).The presence of a triple-negative SUM159 breast tumor modifies the soluble lung microenvironment to enhance breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and used for the generation of lung-conditioned media (LCM) as described previously. To assess migration, (a) SUM159 or (b) MCF7 cells were subjected to transwell migration assays for 18 h as described in the Materials & Methods. To assess proliferation, (c) SUM159 or (d) MCF7 cells were subjected to BrdU incorporation assays as described in the Materials & Methods. Five high-powered fields of view (HP-FOV) were used to enumerate migrated or proliferating cells using ImageJ software (NIH). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM (LCM from n = 15/mice per group). \u03b1 = significantly different from LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.05).

Venn diagram showing the number of similar versus unique proteins identified under each LCM condition.Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from triple negative breast cancer cells induce expression of the premetasatic ECM markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts. Breast cancer-derived EVs were isolated from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines as described in the Materials and Methods and characterized as described in Supplemental Figure S4. Cell lines included non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D), three TN cell lines (MDA-MB-231 (231), SUM159 and LRCP17 (derived from a patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells.

Notably, FGF2 stimulation produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in MDA-MB-231 cells, and FGF2-induced nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 was abrogated by the ROS scavenging agent, N-acetylcysteine.INTRODUCTIONTumor is composed of both cancer cells and surrounding normal cells in the stroma which cooperate with each other. Fibroblasts, major stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, play a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. Firoblasts associated with tumor stroma have been called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) secreted by CAFs are known to promote cancer cell proliferation. FGFs mediate their effects through binding to the corresponding membrane-bound fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). FGF-FGFR axis accounts for acquired resistance to estrogen receptor-directed therapy that can be overcome by FGFR inhibitors.FGFR comprises highly conserved transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), FGFR1-4, and another membrane-associated receptor that lacks the intracellular domain (FGFR5/FGFRL1). Like the majority of other transmembrane RTKs, FGFRs undergo dimerization and phosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosines upon ligand binding. The resulting phosphorylated tyrosines dock a distinct set of adaptor proteins, leading to transcriptional activation of downstream oncogenic targets including PI3K/Akt and STATs. Our previous study has demonstrated that FGF2 predominantly produced by CAF stimulates breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and progression. Of the FGF receptors, FGFR1 exhibits high affinity for FGF2. Here, we report a non-canonical function of FGFR1 in the FGF2-induced target gene expression in the context of breast cancer cell growth and survival.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and antibodiesHuman recombinant FGF2 protein was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc.

Antibodies against Nrf2, CREB-binding protein (CBP), \u03b1-tubulin, lamin B and \u03b2-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent was a product of Pierce Biotechnology (Rockfold, IL, USA). MTT and 2\u2019,7\u2019-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) were products of Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) secondary antibody, 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Invitrogen (Waltham, MA, USA).Cell cultureHuman breast cancer cell lines were maintained as described elsewhere. Primary normal fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs supplied from Asterand Bioscience (Detroit, MI, USA) were incubated in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium supplemented with 10% fatal bovine serum (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 100 ng/mL penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone mixtureand other supplements. CCD-1068sk breast NFs ATCC, (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/mL penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone mixture. The cells were plated at an appropriate density according to each experimental scale.Collection of conditioned media (CM)CAFs were seeded on 100 mm dishes at 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. Culture medium was removed 24 hours after cell seeding, and cells were washed with PBS, followed by addition of 8 mL of serum-free medium. After 48 hours of incubation, the CM was collected and passed through 0.2 \u03bcm membrane syringe filter to remove residual cells and debris. For neutralization of FGF2 in the CM of CAFs, CM was pre-incubated with 25 \u03bcg/mL of human FGF2 antibody or its IgG control (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature prior to use.Measurement of cell viabilityMCF-7 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-468 cells were plated at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL in 48-well plates, and the cell viability was determined by the conventional MTT reduction assay. After 24-hour incubation with CAF-CM, cells were treated with the MTT solution (final concentration 0.5 mg/mL) for 3 hours at 37\u00baC. The dark blue formazan crystals that formed in intact cells were solubilized by dimethy sulfoxide (DMSO), and absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a microplate reader (Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Results were expressed at the percentage of MTT reduction obtained in the treated cells, assuming that the absorbance of control cells was 100%.Xenograft assayFemale Balb/c (nu/nu) mice, 5 weeks of age, were purchased from Orientbio (Seoul, Korea). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seoul National University. After 1 week of adaptation, MDA-MB-231 cells with control or TGF-\u03b2-activated CCD-1068sk fibroblasts were co-injected subcutaneously into the flank of mice as described previously.Western blot analysisCells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tri-HCl [pH 7.4], 25 mM NaF, 20 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitiol [DTT], 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], protease inhibitor cocktail tablets) for 15 minutes on ice followed by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 20 minutes. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by using the BCA reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Protein (30 \u03bcg) was separated by running through 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk/TBST (Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hour at room temperature. The membranes were incubated for 4 hours at room temperature with 1:1,000 dilution of polyclonal antibody of FGFR1, P-FRS2\u03b1, P-Akt, P-STAT3, and \u03b2-actin. The blots were rinsed three times with TBST buffer for 10 minutes each. Washed blots were incubated with 1:5,000 dilutions of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) for 1 hour and washed again three times with TBST buffer. The transferred proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK).Reverse transcription (RT)-PCRThe RT-PCR assay was performed as described previously using the below primers.

The sense and antisense strands of FGFR1 siRNA were as follows; 5\u2019-AUUCAAACCUGACCACAGA-3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019-UCUGUGGUCAGGUUUGAAU-3\u2019 (reverse). MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 25 nM of specific or scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction (Invitrogen).ImmunocytochemistryCells (MDA-MB 231 with CAF or NF and MDA-MB-231 alone) were seeded at 1 x 104 cells per well in an 8 chamber plate. The cells were incubated for 1 hour in the absence or presence of FGF2 and then fixed with fixation solution containing 95% methanol and 5% acetic acid. The cells were then washed in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% triton X-100, washed in PBS and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Polyclonal rabbit anti-FGFR1, diluted 1:100 in 1% BSA in PBS, was applied overnight at 4\u00baC. This was followed by washing cells in PBS and then incubation for 1 hour at room temperature with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody diluted at 1:1,000 in 1% BSA-PBS. After washing, cells were treated with DAPI or PI. The expression of FGFR1 was detected using a confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).ImmunoprecipitationImmunoprecipitation assay of CBP and Nrf2 was performed as described previously. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer for 1 hour on ice, followed by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 12,000 g. Three hundred \u03bcg of pre-cleared lysates were incubated with 10 \u03bcL of anti-CBP antibodies for overnight. Forty \u03bcL of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotech) was then added to the mixture and rotated for 4 hours at 4\u00baC. The beads were washed with ice-cold PBS prior to Western blot analysis.Preparation of nuclear extractsAfter treatment with FGF2, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped in 1 mL PBS and centrifuge at 7,000 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00baC. Pellets were suspended in 50 \u03bcL of hypotonic buffer A (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.8], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF) for 15 minutes on ice, and 1 \u03bcL of 10% Nonidet P-40 solution was added for 5 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 7 minutes. The pellets were washed with hypotonic buffer and were resuspended in hypertonic buffer C (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.8], 20% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF) for 30 minutes on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 7 minutes. The supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected and stored at \u201370\u00baC after determination of the protein concentration by using the Bradford method using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).Measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)DCF-DA was used as a fluorescent probe to monitor the net intracellular accumulation of ROS. After treatment with FGF2 or CAF-CM, MDA-MB-231 cells were rinsed with PBS and were loaded with 10 \u03bcM of DCF-DA. After 30-minute incubation, the intracellular ROS accumulation was determined by fluorescent microscopy set at 488 nm for excitation and 530 nm for emission or by flow cytometry.Human cancer genome expression analysesRNA-seq data set of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast invasive carcinoma was download from XenaBrower (https://xenabrowser.net). The mRNA expression levels of total 1,097 samples (Illumina HiSeq log [normalized counts + 1]) were prepared by quantile normalization. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to predict the relationship between two genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for FGFR1 expression in primary breast cancer samples was performed as described previously. The Kaplan\u2013Meier plotter, an online biomarker validation tool (kmplot.com/analysis), was used to estimate survival probabilities for 255 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients based on FGFR1 and Nrf2 gene expression.To determine the relationship between FGFR1 and FGF2 or Akt3 proteins in breast cancers, we selected \u201cBreast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Pan-Cancer Atlas)\u201d data set publicly available from TCGA data portal (www.cbioportal.org). The clinical significance of association between FGFR1 and FGF2 or AKT3 protein expression was evaluated by calculating the Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient.Statistical analysisWhen necessary, data were represented as means of \u00b1 standard deviation at least three independent experiments, and statistical analysis between groups was performed using the Student\u2019s t-test (Sigma plot 7.0; Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA): *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.RESULTSTo determine whether CAFs are involved in cancer cell proliferation, breast cancer cells were treated with CM from CAFs (CAF-CM) or that from NFs (NF-CM). As illustrated in Figure 1A, estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells treated with CAF-CM were more proliferative than estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cells. In addition, MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with CAF-CM exhibited elevated activation of oncogenic signaling molecules such as Akt and STAT3 through phosphorylation (Fig. 1B).Our previous study demonstrated the secretion of FGF2 from CAFs derived from human breast cancer. As described in the previous study, TNBC cells do express FGFR1 in a basal status, whilst expression of its ligand FGF2 was not detected. Thus, we used MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cells to examine further cellular events under the paracrine condition. Notably, CAF-CM-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly decreased in the presence of FGF2-neutralizing antibody in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C). As shown in Figure 1D, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with human recombinant FGF2 induced phosphorylation of Akt and the FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) required for the FGF-mediated activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling. We then analyzed the transcriptome of 1,097 primary breast cancer tissue samples from TCGA datasets by RNA-seq. FGFR1 and FGF2 expression levels showed positive correlation in primary breast cancer samples (Fig. 1E). There was also statistically significant correlation between protein expression of FGFR1 and FGF2 (Fig. 1F) or AKT3 (Fig. 1G) in 97 invasive breast carcinoma specimens.To address the involvement of FGFR1 in FGF2-induced oncogenic events, FGFR1 was silenced in MDA-MB-231 cells by use of specific si-RNA. As a result, FGF2-induced phosphorylation of FRS2 was abolished (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, siRNA silencing of FGFR1 suppressed the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-468 cells as well (Fig. S1).TGF-\u03b2 is a representative inducer of fibroblast activation. Tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 cells co-injected with TGF-\u03b2-activated fibroblasts (CCD-1068sk-TGF-\u03b2) showed enlarged stromal compartment as evidenced by increased Masson\u2019s trichrome staining (Fig. 2B) which measures collagen network, indicative of the presence of fibroblasts. Furthermore, there was increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining in tumors of mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and CCD-1068sk-TGF-\u03b2 (Fig. 2B). These tumors also displaed significantly elevated Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, TGF-\u03b2 signaling, hedgehog signaling, and myogenesis gene sets were significantly enriched in breast cancers highly expressing FGFR1 (Fig. 2D). These results further support the oncogenic function of FGFR1 in tumor microenvironment.Besides their classical function as membrane-bound receptors in signal transduction, some RTKs are reported to be trafficked from the cell surface to the nucleus in response to ligand binding or heterologous agonist exposure. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), for instance, associates with several gene promoters, suggesting its potential role as a transcription factor. This prompted us to examine the possibility of nuclear localization of FGFR1 and its involvement in transcriptional regulation of FGF2 target genes.When MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CAFs, FGFR1 in cancer cells underwent nuclear translocation (Fig. 3A). Additionally, direct treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with FGF2 enhanced FGFR1 accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 3B). The nuclear localization of FGFR1 in response of FGF2 stimulation was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Notably, MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with FGF2 or CAF-CM exhibited markedly elevated levels of intracellular ROS as measured by using the fluorescent probe, DCF-DA (Fig. 3D and 3E).It has been reported that the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2, activated upon stimulation with FGFs, subsequently accumulates in the nuclear compartment. Of note, an ROS scavenging agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) attenuated FGF2-induced nuclear localization of FGFR1 as well as Nrf2 (Fig. 3F). As illustrated in Figure 3G, there was a direct physical interaction between FGFR1 and the transcriptional co-activator, p300/CBP as well as Nrf2 in MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with FGF2. We speculate that FGFR1 binding to p300/CBP may facilitate the recruitment of Nrf2.To examine the clinical importance of an interaction between FGFR1 and Nrf2 in breast cancer progression, we analyzed a TNBC patient survival rate upon cohort bifurcation based on the mean expression value of FGFR1 and Nrf2. Analysis of a cohort TNBC patients revealed that combination of FGFR1 and Nrf2 gene expression led to a decreased survival rate compared with FGFR1 or Nrf2 expression alone (Fig. 4A).Cyclin D1, one of the key players in cell proliferation, has been reported to be a putative target of nuclear FGFR1, and its expression is also associated with Nrf2. In line with this notion, the expression of cyclin D1 was increased in MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with FGF2. FGF2-induced expression of cyclin D1 was abolished by the introduction of FGFR1-siRNA (Fig. 4B and 4C).DISCUSSIONIn the current study, nuclear localization of FGFR1 was significantly elevated in response to FGF2. It is speculated that newly synthesized FGFR1, upon stimulation with its ligand FGF2, can enter the nucleus from endoplasmic reticulum. Since FGFR1 does not have nuclear localization signal (NLS), it may require cargo proteins which contain NLS. While surface FGFR1 can translocate to nucleus as a complex with FGF2 which has NLS, newly synthesized FGFR1 would require an alternative nuclear transport mechanism.Nuclear localization of other RTKs including EGFR and ErbB-2 has been reported by several groups. The ligand-activated cell surface RTKs after internalization through endocytosis undergo retrograde trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently. EGFR is translocated from endoplasmic reticulum to the inner nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complexes, which is regulated by importin-\u03b2. Importin-\u03b2 is also considered to be involved in the nuclear transport of FGFR-1.Since importin-\u03b2 requires NLS-containing protein in order to import its interacting protein such as FGFR1 to the nucleus, the nuclear import of FGFR1 may need another cargo protein. Sec61 can be a candidate of transport shuttle of FGFR1 as it plays a key role in translocating the membrane bound EGFR complex by interacting with EGFR-bound importin-\u03b2. FGFR1 does bind to Sec61 translocon, which is associated with inner nuclear membrane and hence may deliver FGFR1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleoplasm. However, the nuclear transport of FGFR-1 appears to be distinct from that of EGFR family proteins; while the soluble importin-\u03b2 regulates FGFR-1 nuclear transport, the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated importin-\u03b2 mediates nuclear transport of EGFR through the membrane-bound INTERNET (integral trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nuclear envelope transport) pathway. The nuclear accumulation of FGFR1 is activated by changes in cell contacts and by stimulation of cells with growth factors, neurotransmitters and hormones as well as by a variety of different second messengers and thus was named integrative nuclear FGFR1 signaling. An early study by Maher detected FGFR1 in the nuclear fraction of FGF2-treated cells, suggesting that the receptor may play a direct role in regulating gene transcription. Nuclear FGFR1 has been reported to be involved in upregulation of invasive gene expression in breast cancer cells. While our manuscript was being prepared, a report addressing an unconventional role for FGFR1 in gene transcription regulation in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer has been published. Of note, nuclear FGFR1 induces a gene expression profile which confers resistance to antiestrogens. Moreover, the nuclear localization of FGFR1 in pancreatic stellate cells has been shown to facilitate invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.One of nuclear FGFR1\u2019s functions is to act as a transcriptional co-activator as proposed for EGFR. If FGFR1 does not harbor a DNA binding domain, it may interact with transcription factors and indirectly regulates downstream gene expression (Fig. 4D). In line with this speculation, nuclear FGFR2 has been shown to bind to hypoxia inducible transcription factor-1 and -2 and negatively modulate their transcriptional activities. We found that the redox-sensitive transcription factor, Nrf2 co-localized FGFR1 in the nucleus in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells upon FGF2 stimulation which was abolished by NAC treatment (J. Suh and Y.-J. Surh, unpublished observation). Potential interaction between FGFR1 and Nrf2 and its implications for breast cancer growth and progression merit further investigation.In summary, the results from our present study suggest that paracrine FGF2 stimulation undergoes FGFR1 nuclear localization, which might regulate oncogenic gene transcription presumably through cooperation between CBP and other transcription factors. This might provide a novel molecular mechanism by which CAF-secreted factors affect the oncogenic gene expression of cancer cells in tumor microenvironment. Thus, inhibition of nuclear FGFR1 could be an attractive therapeutic strategy in the management of breast cancer.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSSupplementary materials can be found via https://doi.org/10.15430/JCP.2022.27.1.68.

On the other hand, newly synthesized FGFR-1 is speculated to enter the nucleus as a complex with a cargo protein harboring NLS. FGFR-1 is translocated to the inner nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which is regulated by importin \u03b2.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

P values are reported as: ns, nonsignificant; *, P <\u00a0.05; **, P <\u00a0.01; ***, P <\u00a0.001; ****, P <\u00a0.0001.Continued.Continued.The relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC was estimated by expression profile clustering using classic CAF markers reported in previous studies, including ACTA2, FAP, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PDPN, THY1 and COL1A1. The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.  Biglycan correlates biological features and clinical outcomesThe correlation between BGN and immune features. a, Heatmap showing the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes. b, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and ESTIMATE stromal and immune scores. c, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and CIBERSORT-derived immune cell scores. Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

Chemotherapy is one of the cornerstone treatments in patients with breast cancer, which overall improves breast cancer outcome by 5\u201310% in patients with node negative disease. However, its use is increasingly affected by chemotherapy resistance and lack of effective predictors. Recently, emerging evidences have suggested that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could contribute to chemotherapy resistances in breast cancer treatment. As the most frequent component of stroma cells in tumor microenvironment, CAFs have been assumed to play an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of breast cancer. Moreover, Farmer et al. reported that increased stromal gene expression predicts resistance to preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC), suggesting that stroma activation could be involved in chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, it was shown that CAFs mediated resistance to chemotherapy by releasing collagen I. Loeffler et al. have developed a vaccine that could target CAFs and allow reversing resistance to chemotherapy.Considering the interaction between CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, it would be reasonable that chemotherapy-induced damage could have an impact on CAFs and change the expression of some relevant factors, which could participate in chemotherapy resistance. In our study, we have cultured CAFs which were derived from surgically resected primary breast cancers and compared the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy. The goal will be to find candidate markers from tumor microenvironment that associate with breast cancer chemotherapy resistance and discuss the possibility that these markers could be used as predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and feasible for targeted therapy.Materials and Methods1. Ethics StatementThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Written informed consent for using the samples for research purposes was obtained from all patients prior to surgery.2. Cell Culture of CAFs and Breast Cancer Cell LineTissues for primary cultures of CAFs were collected from 10 breast cancer patients who underwent complete surgical resection of their tumors at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Only tissues in excess of those required for clinical diagnoses were harvested for this study. Harvested tissues were placed in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen Corporation) for immediate transportation on ice to the laboratory. Tissues were minced into small pieces, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and digested for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in prepared reagent containing collagenase type I and Hyaluronidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell suspension was filtrated with 100 mesh screen and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and then the pellet was resuspended in the fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cell counting was performed with the Beckman Coulter Cell and Particle Counter Z1. The population doubling was estimated based on the increase in cell number counted at each passage time. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as the breast cancer cell line, according to the normal procedure (Sigma-Aldrich).3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)Primary antibodies for immunostaining included multi-cytokeratin (CK), Vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), CD34, and TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) (Labvision). CAFs were seeded in chamber slides and fixed in cold acetone. After antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous peroxidase in 3% hydrogen peroxide, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature in a moist chamber for 60 min. Specific signals were visualized by incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 min, followed by incubation with 3,3/-diaminobenzidine (DAB) used as a chromogen to create brown staining. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 min, and the slides were coverslipped.4. Flow Cytometry (FCM)CAFs were collected and prepared as a single cell suspension by mechanical blowing with PBS at the concentration of 1\u00d7105/ml. The expression of CD34 and CD45 (MACS) was detected using FCM (FACSC alibar; BD).5. Cell Adhesion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber (Transwell; Corning). For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere (Sanofi). Afterwards, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, until confluent. Matrigel (BD) was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and then 100 \u00b5l matrigel was added to each well in new 24-well plates. Two groups of MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and transferred to 24-well plates coated with matrigel. After incubation for 1 h, MDA-MB-231 cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of MDA-MB-231 cells that adhered to the bottom of coated wells was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.6. Invasion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. Matrigel was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and 50 \u00b5l/cm2 matrigel was added to each filter. The filters were placed in 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were added to each upper chamber, and CAFs were added to the lower chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed with a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.7. Proliferation Assay (MTT)The harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were treated with 0 ng/ml, 4 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml Taxotere, respectively. Then the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. Assays were initiated by adding 100 \u00b5l MTT (2 mg/ml) to each well and incubating the cells for an additional 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterwards, the medium was removed and 1 ml dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. Finally, the supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates in triplicate, which were read at a wavelength of 550 nm with a Thermo Scientific Multiskan\u00ae Spectrum.8. mRNA Expression ProfilingTotally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). Total RNA was extracted from all cultured CAFs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Microarray studies were performed by Capital Medical University Microarray Centre, using Illumina humanHT-12 v4 expression BeadChip based on Illumina BeadStation500. The biotinylated cRNA preparation, hybridization, and scanning of microarrays were done according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Biological replicates have been used to reduce errors. Illumina Gene Expression Beaderchips have internal control features to monitor data quality. The GenomeStudio software (Ilumina) calculates and reports a detection p-value, which determines whether a transcript on the array is called detected. In our study, a detection p-value below the threshold of 0.01 indicated that a gene could be considered as expressed. Differentially expressed genes in CAFs before chemotherapy vs. after chemotherapy were also identified and analyzed with GenomeStudio. The output was filtered to include genes whose expression was altered at least two-fold. The dataset of the microarray analysis has been deposited in ArrayExpress, with the accession number E-MTAB-1614.9. Real-Time PCRReal-Time PCR was performed to confirm differential gene expression in cultured CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h), using BIO-RAD IQ5 Real-Time PCR System. cDNA was synthesized using 1 \u00b5g total RNA, oligo (dT), and Superscript\u2122 III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Synthesis was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All the primers were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) for thecandidate genes. Predicted PCR product sequences were verified by using BLAST for recognition of target and non-target sequences.10. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc). Student\u2019s t test was used to test for statistical significance. Data were presented as the mean\u00b1standard error. p<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.Results1. Characterization of Primary-cultured CAFsBy using a study protocol approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board, CAFs were cultured from 10 surgically resected primary breast cancers which were histologically confirmed. The cultured cells were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. The morphological and immunohistochemical pictures of CAFs were represented in Figure 1A. Additionally, FCM showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs (Figure 1B).Characterization of primary-cultured CAFs.A showed the cultured cells which were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. B showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs with FCM.2. CAFs Promotes the Function of Breast Cancer Cells after ChemotherapyWe assumed that chemotherapy-induced damage interacted with tumor microenvironment and hence compared the function of MDA-MB-231 cells after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere) co-cultured with CAFs and that without CAFs. By using cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. The representative pictures of cell functional studies were shown in Figure 2.The function comparison of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, when treated with Taxotere.By using cell adhesion assay (A), invasion assay (B), and MTT assay (C), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with cells without co-culture.3. Comparison of Gene Expression Profiling in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyTotally 24314 expressed genes were detected in the microarray assay and 35 differentially expressed genes were identified (absolute fold change >2) between CAFs after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were summarized in Table S1 and Figure 3A with clustering analysis. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity (Figure 3B). The differentially expressed genes were also annotated in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion (hsa04510), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton (hsa04810), and MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010).Hierarchical clustering of gene analysis expression and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere).A showed the Heatmap plot of scaled gene-expression levels.

Differential Expression of Candidate Genes in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyWe have picked up 6 genes from 35 differential genes and confirmed the different gene expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) via Real-Time PCR, using triplicate samples. The candidate genes included up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05). The pictures were represented in Figure 4.Differential expression of candidate genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy.The candidate genes were picked up from 35 differential genes, including up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. The differential expression of 6 genes in three pairs of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) was confirmed by Real-Time PCR. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05).DiscussionAs is known, cancer is a systemic disease encompassing multiple components of both tumor cells themselves and tumor microenvironment. The notion is now widely accepted that the development and progression of cancer highly depends on the interactions between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Recently, many investigations have pointed to stromal cells as the major regulator in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast cancers. However, the origin of CAFs has been a debate. Based on different theories, CAFs might arise from activated resident fibroblasts, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, cancer cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or other undetermined mechanisms. Correspondingly, CAFs were reported to exhibit different expression of multiple biomarkers such \u03b1-SMA, FSP-1, FAP, platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b1), platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b2), vimentin, CAV-1, PTEN, p21, or TP53 mutation. According to our study, CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) and negative expression of CK, CD34, as well as CD45, suggesting that these primary-cultured CAFs were more likely to arise from activated resident fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cells, endothelial cells or bone marrow. We are aware that the observation based on morphological characteristics is just weak evidence for explaining the origin hypothesis, which needs further and more fundamental studies. Moreover, our data showed that CAFs could promote the adhesion, invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells, which was consistent with peer researches.Breast cancer is known as the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been considered as an effective way which could improve the outcomes especially in patients with advanced and inflammatory diseases. However, the resistance of tumor cells to a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs and lack of useful predictive markers of response to NAC continue to be problems. Though the precise nature and molecular mechanism of chemotherapy resistance is still unclear, many current studies have focused on identifying novel predictors of chemotherapy efficiency. CAFs merit attention, in consideration of frequent association with chemotherapy resistance. Sonnenberg et al. reported highly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in CAFs from lung and breast, which could explain some levels of resistance in stroma-positive tumors where stroma would not be sensitive to chemotherapy. Furthermore, an oral DNA vaccine targeting fibroblasts activation protein (FAP) was developed to suppress primary tumor cell growth and metastasis of multidrug-resistant murine breast carcinoma and allowed reversing resistance to chemotherapy, by increasing intratumoral drug uptake. Based on our data, the comparison of gene expression profiling between CAFs before and after chemotherapy indicated the solid gene changes and provided candidate markers that might participate in chemotherapy resistance. Considering the correlation of breast cancer treatment and tumor microenvironment (especially CAFs), we suppose that the genes about membrane protein and secreted factors will be likely to associate with chemotherapy resistance. Then we have looked through the relevant literatures, to evaluate the research status and prospect of these genes, and eventually chosen CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 as candidate genes. The differential expression of these genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed by RT-RCR (p<0.05), suggesting potential predictors of response to treatment.CXCL2 is one member of a family of structurally related chemokines, which are also called ELR-positive subgroup of CXC-chemokines. It was reported that CXCL2 could enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro and differential expression of CXCL2 in colon cancer had impact on metastatic disease and survival. In addition, CXCL2 was found to show significantly different expression in 5-FU responder and nonresponder breast cancer cell lines, suggesting its relationship with chemotherapy response. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 has been focused on, in view of the association between its five polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Moreover, the study carried out by Li et al. established the relationship between TP and MMPs in cancer cell invasion. Recently, the up-regulation expression of MMP1 was observed during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude mice, indicating potential targets involved in the control of metastasis. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which was indicated to correlate with the growth and progression of tumors. Some interesting observations were made with regard to the prognostic role of baseline plasma IL8 protein levels in breast cancer patients treated with weekly docetaxel. Besides, Snoussi et al. pointed out that the polymorphisms in IL-8 and its receptor CXCR2 are associated with increased breast cancer risk and disease progress, implying that IL-8 and CXCR2 might contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis and aggressiveness. Lee et al. found that increased expression of IL-8 in the tumor microenvironment enhanced colon cancer growth and metastasis, which is very inspiring for our research. All the above markers including CXCL2, MMP1 and IL-8 were up-regulated based on our study, while FGF1, RARRES1 and CXCR7 as follows were down-regulated.As is known, breast cancer cells overexpress fibroblast growth factor receptors. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) was reported to be especially suitable as chemotherapeutic drug carrier in light of its biological activity. Additionally, FGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR could efficiently decrease breast cancer cell viability, suggesting the possibility for targeted therapy. According to these data, it could be assumed that decreased expression of FGF1 might be involved in the chemotherapy resistance. Retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1) is a retinoid regulated gene, which is accounted as a tumor suppress gene and lost in many cancer cells. It has been demonstrated that the down-regulation of RARRES1 is related to tumor growth of colorectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The investigation on the role of RARRES1 in the chemotherapy resistance is still rare, therefore its decreased expression in CAFs after chemotherapy caused our attention. CXCR7, as well as CXCR4, have been known as the receptors of chemokine CXCL12. Liberman et al. considered that CXCR7 would elicit anti-tumorigenic functions, and may act as a regulator of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling in neuroblastoma. Recently Hernandez et al. found that CXCR7 impaired invasion of breast cancer, in contrast to CXCR4. We propose that CXCR7 would contribute to the chemotherapy resistance in the condition of treatment-induced damage to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, in the abovementioned candidate genes, CXCL2, MMP1 and IL8 are recognized as secretory-type genes, which possibly could be tested in serum in the form of genes or proteins. Its relationship with prognosis will be studied.Overall, in this study we have primarily cultured CAFs, compared its gene expression profiling before and after chemotherapy, and picked up 6 candidate genes which are possibly associated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. We hope that our study might supply the potential predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and possible targets for treatment, which could provide the patient with optimal therapeutic management and better prognosis. For further study, the molecular mechanism of these candidate markers will continue to be researched to elucidate their relationship with chemotherapy resistance.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer statistics, 2012Effects of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy for early breast cancer on recurrence and 15-year survival: an overview of the randomised trialsImplication of tumor microenvironment in the resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patientsStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionRoots and stems: stem cells in cancerA stroma-related gene signature predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancerRole of extracellular matrix assembly in interstitial transport in solid tumorsTargeting tumor-associated fibroblasts improves cancer chemotherapy by increasing intratumoral drug uptakeTumor microenvironment and breast cancer progression: A complex scenarioFibroblasts in cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor growth-bystanders turning into key playersA fibroblast-associated antigen: characterization in fibroblasts and immunoreactivity in smooth muscle differentiated stromal cellsEpithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer can provide a nonmalignant stromaBone marrow contribution to tumor-associated myofibroblasts and fibroblastsAdipose tissue-derived stem cells differentiate into carcinoma-associated fibroblast-like cells under the influence of tumor-derived factorsp53 Attenuates cancer cell migration and invasion through repression of SDF-1/CXCL12 expression in stromal fibroblastsExpression of p21waf1/Cip1 in stromal fibroblasts of primary breast tumorsPten in stromal fibroblasts suppresses mammary epithelial tumoursCaveolin-1 and mitochondrial SOD2 (MnSOD) function as tumor suppressors in the stromal microenvironment: a new genetically tractable model for human cancer associated fibroblastsRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisImpact, mechanisms, and novel chemotherapy strategies for overcoming resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes in metastatic breast cancerAdvances in neoadjuvant (primary) systemic therapy with cytotoxic agentsResearch issues affecting preoperative systemic therapy for operable breast cancer17p12 deletion in breast cancer predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapyBRCA1 protein levels and PIK3CA mutations as predictive biomarkers for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: An exploratory analysisHighly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from lung and breastThe role of CXC chemokines and their receptors in cancerDifferential expression of the chemokines GRO-2, GRO-3, and interleukin-8 in colon cancer and their impact on metastatic disease and survivalCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCurrent evidence on the relationship between five polymorphisms in the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) gene and lung cancer risk: A meta-analysisIncreased Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases Mediates Thromboxane A2-Induced Invasion in Lung Cancer CellsProtein expression changes during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude miceIncreased expression of MMP-9 and IL-8 are correlated with poor prognosis of Bladder CancerInterleukin-8 secretion by ovarian cancer cells increases anchorage-independent growth, proliferation, angiogenic potential, adhesion and invasionExpression of Angiogenic Markers in the Peripheral Blood of Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer Treated with Weekly DocetaxelCombined effects of IL-8 and CXCR2 gene polymorphisms on breast cancer susceptibility and aggressivenessInterleukin-8 and its receptor CXCR2 in the tumour microenvironment promote colon cancer growth, progression and metastasisFGF-1 as a possible carrier for targeted drug deliveryFGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR efficiently decrease cell viability upon NIR irradiationTazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) expression in prostate carcinomas and its relationship to tumorigenicityRole of the RARRES1 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinomaRARRES1 expression is significantly related to tumour differentiation and staging in colorectal adenocarcinomaInvolvement of the CXCR7/CXCR4/CXCL12 Axis in the Malignant Progression of Human NeuroblastomaOpposing roles of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in breast cancer metastasis"

These findings support targeting active stromal fibroblasts through restoration of let-7b/IL-8 expression as a therapeutic option for breast carcinomas.INTRODUCTIONDespite early detection and targeted therapies, breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Breast carcinomas are composed of tumor cells and different types of non-carcinogenic cells that constitute tumor stroma. It became clear that the carcinoma-stroma interplay is critical for carcinogenesis through intercellular cross-talk. Fibroblasts, the most common and the most active type of stromal cells, are known as reactive fibroblasts, myofibroblasts or cancer-associated fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts have a prominent role in the growth, progression and spread of tumor cells through active release of various growth factors, cytokines and chemokines such as TGF-\u03b21, SDF-1 and IL-6. The active status of myofibroblasts is sustained even in absence of the activating signal, due mainly to the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop that links inflammation to cancer. One of the important members of this loop is the Let-7b, which belongs to the let-7 family of microRNAs. Members of this family are highly conserved in sequence and function from C. elegans to humans, and play important roles in several physiological and pathological processes such as development, differentiation as well as carcinogenesis. Functionally, let-7 family members act as tumor suppressor in several types of malignant human tumors by inhibiting the expression of oncogenes and key regulators of mitogenic pathways. Indeed, the expression of let-7 family members has been found reduced in many types of cancers. Furthermore, it has been shown that the restoration of let-7b expression effectively inhibited the growth of lung and breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as in mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, it has been recently reported that let-7b expression was reduced in breast cancer tissues and was inversely associated with tumor lymph node metastasis, patient overall survival and relapse-free survival. Furthermore, breast cancer patients with low let-7b expression had poor prognoses, indicating that let-7b could act as tumor suppressor miRNA in breast cancer onset and spread.In the present report, we have shown that let-7b suppresses the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast cancer-associated fibroblasts through negative regulation of IL-8.RESULTSBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts express low level of let-7b, and specific inhibition of let-7b activates breast stromal fibroblastsTo investigate the importance of let-7b in breast stromal fibroblasts (BSF) activation and the carcinoma-stroma functional interplay, we first assessed the level of this microRNA in 13 CAFs and their corresponding tumor counterpart fibroblasts (TCFs) derived from the same patients and cultured simultaneously. Total RNA was purified from these cells and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to amplify/quantify the let-7b microRNA. Figure 1A shows let-7b down-regulation in all CAFs relative to their corresponding TCFs, with great difference between the different pairs. This prompted us to test the possible implication of let-7b down-regulation in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, normal breast stromal fibroblasts (TCF-346) were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control sequence (TCF-346c) for 24 h, and then the levels of let-7b and its downstream targets were assessed by qRT-PCR. Figure 1B shows that let-7b level was significantly reduced, with concomitant strong up-regulation of IL-6 (12 fold) in TCF-346i as compared to control cells. Similarly, let-7b inhibition increased the levels of miR-21 and RELA that codes for NF-\u03baB (p65), while it reduced the level of PTEN as compared to the control cells (Figure 1B). These results suggest that let-7b inhibition activated the IL-6-related positive feedback loop. To confirm this observation, we tested the effect of let-7b inhibition on the expression of Lin28B and the activation of STAT3 and AKT, three major components of the loop. To this end, cell lysates were prepared from TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, and proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis. We first confirmed that let-7b inhibition increased the expression of IL-6 at the protein level as well (Figure 1C). Subsequently, we have shown that let-7b inhibition activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and AKT (p-AKT), and up-regulated Lin28B, an inhibitor of let-7b (Figure 1C). This indicates that the inhibition of let-7b function activated the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop in BSFs. Thereby, we tested the effect of let-7b inhibition on the activation of BSFs by assessing the levels of the three major markers of active fibroblasts (ACTA2 (\u03b1-SMA), SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b21). Interestingly, let-7b inhibitor increased the mRNA levels of these three genes as compared to the negative control (Figure 1D). On the other hand, the level of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A was decreased in TCF-346i as compared to controls (Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained when TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells were passaged once and were reincubated in let-7b inhibitor-free medium (Supplementary Figure 1). These results suggest that let-7b inhibition activates breast stromal fibroblasts.Let-7b inhibition activates breast stromal fibroblasts through the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop(A) Total RNA was purified from the indicated 13 CAF/TCF pairs (T64 to T900), and the level of let-7b was assessed by qRT-PCR. The values obtained in CAFs were divided by the values of their corresponding TCFs, and then were plotted. (B and D) TCF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control (TCF-346c) for 48 h, and then medium was replaced with inhibitor-free medium for 24 h. Total RNA was purified and used for qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 3 independent experiments (*P < 0.05 and **P<0.001). (C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells, and were used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins, and GAPDH was utilized as internal control. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. For the phosphorylated proteins, the levels were determined relative to their respective non-phosphorylated forms.Let-7b inhibition stably activates breast stromal fibroblastsWe then asked whether let-7b inhibition-dependent activation of the loop and BSFs is permanent or transient. Therefore, the medium-containing let-7b inhibitor was removed and replaced with let-7b inhibitor-free medium for 48 h, and then cells were passaged and re-incubated in inhibition-free medium (IFM) 4 times. Figure 2A shows that let-7b remained down-regulated while the levels of miR-21, IL-6, RELA and Lin28B remained up-regulated in TCF-346i relative to controls, despite the removal of the let-7b inhibitor and cells were passaged several times. These findings were confirmed in other cells (TCF-64) (Supplementary Figure 2A), and at the protein level for IL-6 and Lin28B (Figure 2B). Furthermore, let-7b inhibition activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and AKT (p-AKT) (Figure 2B). These results indicate that the transient let-7b inhibition activates the positive feedback loop in a persistent manner. Therefore, we also confirmed the persistent activation of BSFs upon let-7b inhibition by showing sustained up-regulation of the \u03b1-SMA protein (Figure 2B) and mRNA (Figure 2C) in TCF-346i relative to TCF-346c. Likewise, the levels of the SDF-1 and TGF \u03b2 -1 mRNAs also remained higher in TCF-346i and TCF-64i relative to their respective controls (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 2B, respectively). On the other hand, the CDKN2A gene remained repressed (Figure 2C). This suggests that let-7b inhibition persistently transformed breast stromal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts likely through the activation of the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop. To confirm this, we decided to investigate the effect of let-7b inhibition on the invasion/migration abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, exponentially growing TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, in IFM and after many passaging, were seeded on the upper chamber wells of the CIM plates 16 with serum-free medium (SFM), while lower chamber wells contained complete medium (CpM). The invasion and migration of cells were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Figure 2E shows increase in the invasion/migration abilities of TCF-346i cells as compared to TCF-346c cells. Using the same system, we have also shown that the proliferation rate of TCF-346i cells was higher than control cells (Figure 2E). This indicates that let-7b inhibition persistently increased the invasion/migration and proliferation abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts, which confirms their sustained activation. This was confirmed at the molecular level by showing the persistent activation of ERK1/2 and the up-regulation of MMP9 in TCF-346i cells as compared to controls (Figure 2F).Let-7b inhibition persistently activates STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop and enhances the invasion/migration/proliferation abilities of breast stromal fibroblastsTCF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control (TCF-346c) for 48 h, and then the medium-containing let-7b inhibitor was removed and replaced with let-7b inhibitor-free medium for 24 h, and then cells were passaged and re-incubated in inhibitor-free medium 4 times. (A and C) Total RNA was purified from the indicated cells and used for qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 3 independent experiments (*P < 0.05 and **P<0.001). (B and F) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. For the phosphorylated proteins, the levels were determined relative to their respective non-phosphorylated forms. (D and E) Exponentially growing TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells (104) in let-7b inhibitor-free medium were added independently into the upper chambers of the 16-well CIM-plates (invasion/migration), while the bottom chambers contained complete medium. For proliferation, cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of complete medium. Cell invasion, migration and proliferation were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.Let-7b inhibition in breast fibroblasts triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in an IL-8-dependent paracrine fashionTo further show the permanent active status of TCF-346i cells, we sought to test their paracrine effects. To perform this, serum-free medium (SFM) was conditioned with TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells for 24 h, and then the resulting serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) (TCF-346c-SFCM and TCF-346i-SFCM, respectively) were first used to assess the effect of let-7b knock-down on the secretion of various cytokines using the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody arrays. Great differential levels of various cytokines were observed between TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, including, GRO, IL-6, IL-8 and IGFBP2 (Figure 3A, 3B). These results were confirmed by ELISA for the most prominent protein IL-8. Indeed, the secreted level of this pro-carcinogenic cytokine was significantly increased in TCF-346i cells compared to controls (Figure 3B).Let-7b inhibition triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in a paracrine manner(A) TCF-346i and TCF-346c cells were incubated for 24 h in SFM and the resulting SFCM (TCF-346i-SFCM and TCF-346c-SFCM, respectively) were applied to cytokine array membranes.

(D and E) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the upper chambers of the CIM plates in presence of the indicated media, while the bottom chambers contained SFM. For proliferation, cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of the indicated SFCM. The migration/invasion and proliferation abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate. (F) Whole cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. (G) MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in TCF-346c-SFCM or TCF-346i-SFCM media containing either IgG (TCF-346i-SFCM + IgG) or neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) (TCF-346i-SFCM + \u03b1IL-8), and then whole cell lysates were prepared and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. (H) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the upper chambers of the CIM plates in presence of the indicated media, while the bottom chambers contained SFM, and migration and invasion abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.To test the paracrine effects of TCF-346i cells on breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on the upper chamber wells of the CIM plates 16 with SFM, while the lower chamber wells contained TCF-346c-SFCM or TCF-346i-SFCM. The migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Figure 3C shows increase in the migration and invasion capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TCF-346i-SFCM as compared to those treated with TCF-346c-SFCM. Similarly, TCF-346i-SFCM enhanced the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to controls (Figure 3D).In addition, we tested the effect of TCF-346c-SFCM and TCF-346i-SFCM on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MDA-MB-231 cells by immunoblotting. Figure 3E shows that TCF-346i-SFCM down-regulated both epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam, while it increased the level of the mesenchymal markers ZEB1, Twist1 and Snail relative to cells exposed to TCF-346c-SFCM. Similarly, the stemness marker ALDH was also up-regulated (Figure 3E). This shows that TCF-346i cells enhanced the EMT process in MDA-MB-231 cells in a paracrine manner, which further confirms the active status of let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts.Since let-7b inhibition strongly increased the expression/secretion of IL-8, we hypothesized the possible implication of this cytokine in the paracrine pro-EMT effects of TCF-346i cells. To verify this, we neutralized IL-8 in TCF-346i-SFCM using specific antibody, while IgG was utilized as control, and then MDA-MB-231 cells were treated as described above. Figure 3F shows that neutralizing IL-8 inhibited the pro-EMT process of TCF-346i-SFCM relative to cells treated with TCF-346i-SFCM containing IgG. Similarly, adding the neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody to TCF-346i-SFCM inhibited its pro-migratory and -invasive effects as compared to cells exposed to TCF-346i-SFCM containing IgG, reaching a level similar to that obtained with TCF-346c-SFCM (Figure 3G). This indicates that the paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects of let-7b-deficient BSF are IL-8-related.Let-7b deficient fibroblasts stimulate breast cancer orthotopic tumor growth in miceTo investigate the effect of let-7b inhibition in human breast fibroblasts on tumor growth in vivo, orthotopic breast tumor xenografts were created under the nipples the 4th left fat pad of nude mice by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (2x106) with either TCF-346i or TCF-346c cells (2x106), which were passaged 4 times post-transfection. Tumors bearing TCF-346i fibroblasts (T-TCF346i) appeared earlier and grew much faster relative to those having control cells (T-TCF346c) (Figure 4A). This indicates that let-7b-deficient BSFs can enhance orthotopic tumor growth in mice. Interestingly, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed more necrosis in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c (Figure 4B). This shows that let-7b-deficient BSFs enhance tumor aggressiveness.Let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts enhance orthotopic tumor growthOrthotopic breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with TCF-346c or TCF-346i cells under the nipple of the 4th left fat pad of nude mice. (A) The histogram shows the volumes of xenograft tumors that were measured at the indicated time points. (B) Tissues were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining (Envision 40x). (C) Orthotopic tumors bearing TCF-346c cells (T-TCF-346c) or TCF-346i cells (T-TCF-346i) were excised and whole cell lysates were prepared and protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. (D) Excised tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry against the indicated proteins.Additionally, whole cell extracts were prepared from T-TCF346i and T-TCF346i tissues, and the levels of various cancer- and metastasis-promoting genes were assessed by immunoblotting. Figure 4C shows that T-TCF346i tumors express higher level of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, ZEB1, Twsit1 and vimentin, while E-cadherin and EpCAM levels were lower as compared to T-TCF346c tumors. This confirms the in vitro results showing the enhancement of the EMT process by let-7b-deficient fibroblasts. In addition, TCF346i cells increased the level of the stemness markers CD44 and ALDH and the pluripotency markers KLF4 and SOX-2 relative to TCF346c cells (Figure 4C). Figure 4C also shows strong increase in the expression levels of the downstream proliferation effectors cyclin D1 and C-Myc in T-TCF346i tumors relative to controls. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing higher Ki-67 staining in T-TCF346i tissue relative to controls (Figure 4D). This shows that the presence of let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts enhanced the growth as well as the EMT/stemness processes in breast cancer cells in orthotopic xenografts. In addition, let-7b-deficient BSFs enhanced the formation of new blood vessels in orthotopic tumors as shown by the strong increase in the staining of the endothelial cells marker CD34 in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c (Figure 4D). This indicates that let-7b-deficient BSFs promote angiogenesis in a paracrine manner. This could result from increase in the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors. Indeed, the levels of IL-8, HIF-1\u03b1 and its downstream target VEGF-A were higher in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c, which explains the strong increase in the neo-vascularization shown in the tumors bearing TCF346i fibroblasts (Figure 4C, 4D).Let-7b mimic stably inhibits the STAT3/NF- \u03baB/let-7b autocrine positive feedback loop and represses active breast fibroblastsTo further confirm the role of let-7b in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts, we investigated the effect of increased level of let-7b on active BSFs. Therefore, CAF-346 and CAF-64 cells were transfected with let-7b mimic (CAF-346m and CAF-64m, respectively) or a control sequence (CAF-346c and CAF-64c, respectively) for 24 h, and then total RNA was purified and the level of the let-7b microRNA was assessed. Figures 5A and Supplementary Figure 3A show highly significant increase in the level of let-7b in CAF-346m and CAF-64m as compared to their respective controls. Expectedly, the mRNA level of the let-7b downstream target IL-6 was significantly decreased in CAF-346m relative to controls (Figure 5A). Similar effect was observed for miR-21, RELA and lin28B, whilst PTEN was up-regulated in CAF-346m as compared to the control cells (Figure 5A). Furthermore, let-7b mimic reduced the protein levels of IL-6, Lin28B, active STAT3 (p-STAT3) as well as active AKT (p-AKT) (Figure 5B). This indicates that the increase in the amount of let-7b inhibited the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop. Concomitantly, the increase in the level of let-7b decreased the mRNA levels of the 3 main myofibroblast markers (ACTA2, SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b21), while up-regulated CDKN2A in CAF-346m as compared to control cells (Figure 5C). This indicates that the increase in the amount of let-7b inactivated myofibroblats through inhibiting the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b autocrine positive feedback loop. Indeed, let-7b mimic transformed the shape of cells from large and flat (characteristic of myofibroblasts) to rounded spindle-shaped, which characterize normal fibroblasts (Figure 6A). To test the persistent effect of let-7b mimic, cells were passaged several times, and then the expression of different relevant genes was assessed. Importantly, let-7b level was reduced in both CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S relative to their respective control cells (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 3B). On the other hand, IL-6, miR-21, RELA and lin28B remained down-regulated while PTEN remained up-regulated in CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S cells relative to controls (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 3B). At the protein levels, the IL-6 and Lin28B levels remained reduced, while STAT3 and AKT remained inactive (Figure 6C). Moreover, the level of \u03b1-SMA remained reduced at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 6C and 6D). The lower levels of SDF-1 and TGF \u03b2-1 were also sustained, while the CDKN2A mRNA levels remained up-regulated in CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S as compared to their respective control cells (Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure 3C). This was confirmed by showing reduced migratory, invasive and proliferative capacities of CAF-346m-S cells relative to controls (Figure 6E and 6F). These cellular results were corroborated with decrease in the levels of p-ERK1/2 and MMP-9 in CAF-346m-S as compared to CAF-346c-S cells (Figure 6G). These results indicate that ectopic increase in let-7b level stably reverted myofibroblasts to inactive fibroblasts through inactivation of the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b feedback loop.Increase in the level of let-7b inactivates the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop and suppresses myofibroblastsCAF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b mimic (CAF-346m) or a control sequence (CAF-346c) for 48 h, and then the medium-containing let-7b mimic was removed and replaced with let-7b mimic-free medium for 24 h.

(C and G) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins, and GAPDH was utilized as internal control.

(E) Exponentially growing cells (104) were added independently into the upper chambers of the 16-well CIM-plates, while the bottom chambers contained complete medium. (F) cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of complete medium, and cell proliferation was assessed for 72 h. Cell invasion/migration and proliferation were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.Furthermore, ELISA indicates significant decrease in the secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF-A from CAF-346m-S relative to controls (Figure 7A). This prompted us to investigate the paracrine effect of CAF-346m-S cells and their corresponding controls on breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. To perform this, SFM were conditioned with CAF-346c-S and CAF-346m-S cells for 24 h, and then the resulting SFCM were added to MDA-MB-231 cells. Figure 7B shows decrease in the invasive/migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CAF-346m-S.SFCM as compared to those treated with CAF-346c-SFCM. Furthermore, CAF-346m-S.SFCM up-regulated the epithelial makers (E-cadherin and EpCAM), whilst it reduced the levels of the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, ZEB1, Twist1 and Snail) (Figure 7C). This suggests that CAF-346m-S.SFCM inhibits the EMT process in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Likewise, CAF-346m-S.SFCM reduced the expression level of the stemness marker ALDH (Figure 7C). Together, these results indicate that let-7b mimic represses the procarcinogenic effects of active breast stromal fibroblasts.Overexpression of let-7b by mimic decreased cancer-promoting abilities of breast myofibroblasts(A) SFCM from the indicated cells were collected, and the levels of the indicated proteins were determined by ELISA and were presented in the respective histograms. Error bars indicate mean \u00b1 S.D. **, P<0.001 (n=3). (B) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the presence of the indicated SFCM as described in Figure 2D, and then the migration and invasion abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System.

(C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH.IL-8 is under the control of let-7b and is highly expressed in CAF cellsBased on the results obtained in Figure 3, we sought to investigate the possible implication of let-7b in the control of IL-8 expression. Therefore, the IL-8 mRNA and protein levels were assessed in CAF-346m, TCF-346i and their respective control cells CAF-346c and TCF-346c. Figure 8A shows that while let-7b mimic significantly reduced the level of the IL-8 mRNA, let-7b inhibition strongly up-regulated IL-8 as compared to their respective controls. This let-7b-dependent expression of the IL-8 mRNA was also observed at the protein level (Figure 8B). This indicates that let-7b negatively controls the expression of IL-8. Thereby, we assessed the IL-8 level in various CAF/TCF pairs derived from different breast cancer patients and also normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) derived from plastic surgery. Figure 8C shows that the IL-8 expression level was higher in 8 out of 9 (89%) CAFs relative to their corresponding TCFs, and in all TCF cells as compared to NBFs. Indeed, IL-8 was almost undetectable in NBFs, while CAFs exhibited the highest levels (Figure 8D). This mirrors let-7b down-regulation in the majority of CAF cells compared to their TCF counterparts (Figure 1A).Let-7b negatively controls IL-8, which is highly expressed in CAF cells(A) Total RNA was purified from the indicated cells, and IL-8 level was assessed by qRT-PCR using specific primers. Experiments were performed in triplicate and several times; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 2 independent experiments (**,P < 0.001). (B and C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. (D) Box plot showing IL-8 expression levels in the indicated types of breast fibroblasts as determined in Figure 8C.DISCUSSIONAccumulating evidence indicates that microRNAs play major roles in both the onset as well as the progression of various types of cancer, including breast carcinomas. These effects are not only autocrine, but also paracrine and through secreted exosomes. Indeed, these small non-coding RNAs are both mediators and communicators between cancer cells and their microenvironment. MicroRNAs play also important roles in modulating the biology of cancer-associated fibroblasts towards a more permissive pro-tumoral phenotype. In the present report, we have shown that the tumor suppressor microRNA let-7b is down-regulated in most breast cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to their adjacent paired TCFs; and specific let-7b inhibition granted BSFs with traits of activated fibroblasts, including enhanced migration/invasion and proliferation. Like in cancer cells, this effect was persistent through the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop, which is responsible for the persistent activation of BSFs. The activation of this loop may also provide a molecular explanation for let-7b down-regulation in CAFs. Indeed, let-7b inhibitor Lin28B, is up-regulated in response to the induction of the IL-6 feedback loop in both cancer and fibroblast cells. Previously, Zhao et al have identified several dysregulated miRNAs in breast CAFs, and miR-200 family members were severely suppressed. Subsequently, they have shown that downregulation of miR200s activated breast stromal fibroblasts. Similarly, it has been shown that miR-26b is down-regulated in CAFs from ER-positive breast cancers, and when specifically down-regulated it activated normal breast fibroblasts. This indicates that several miRNAs, like the important tumor suppressor genes p16, p53 and PTEN, also suppress breast stromal fibroblasts, may be through repressing their target onco/inflammatory genes. Several publications have reported the role of microRNAs in activating stromal fibroblasts through modulating the expression of important inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and CCL5. Likewise, we have shown here that let-7b also controls the secretion of several important cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, Gro, Gro-\u03b1 and others (Figure 3A). This prompted us to investigate the paracrine effects of let-7b-deficient BSFs. Importantly, let-7b inhibition enhanced the pro-carcinogenic effects of BSFs in a paracrine manner both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xenografts. These extracellular effects of let-7b-deficient cells are IL-8-dependent. Indeed, these cells secreted high levels of IL-8, and specific inhibition of this cytokine in the corresponding SFCM suppressed the paracrine induction of the EMT process in breast cancer cells (Figure 3). In fact, let-7b represses the expression of IL-8 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Since IL-8 is not a target of let-7b and its 3\u2019UTR does not contain specific let-7b seeding site, this let-7b-dependent regulation of IL-8 expression could be indirect through the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feed back loop. It is well known that IL-8 is a target of the transcription factors STAT3 and NF-\u03baB. Similarly, the expression of IL-8 was inhibited in H.pylori infected gastric epithelial cells with let-7b overexpression and the consequent NF-\u03baB down-regulation. This shows that let-7b negatively controls 2 major imflammatory/cancer-related cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. This was confirmed by showing that most CAFs express high level of IL-8 as compared to their corresponding TCFs. Additionally, we have shown that TCFs, which were generated from histologically normal breast tissues, exhibited higher levels of IL-8 relative to those observed in normal breast fibroblasts. This confirms that TCFs have some active features as previously shown, and thereby may play important roles in local recurrence.Interestingly, inhibition of let-7b in BSF promoted breast cancer tumor growth, EMT, stemness and angiogenesis in orthotopic humanized tumors, which indicates that let-7b has non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive functions. These could be mediated through several cancer-promoting factors such as IL-6 and IL-8.These results were strengthened through overexpression of let-7b by mimic in active CAF cells wherein phenotypes of normal breast fibroblasts were restored. Indeed, CAF cells became fusiform, they expressed lower levels of \u03b1-SMA, SDF-1, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-8, they were less migratory/invasive and proliferative, with strong reduction in their paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects. These data further confirmed the tumor suppressive function of let-7b. Likewise, ectopic expression of miR-200s in CAFs partially restored normal features of breast fibroblasts. Similarly, re-expression of miR-31 in CAFs inhibited their capacity to promote endometrial tumor cell migration and invasion. This conversion from active CAFs to normal fibroblasts by miRNAs was also observed in ovarian CAFs. This indicates that several miRNAs are key players in suppressing the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts through post-transcriptional gene regulation.In summary, the present findings indicate that let-7b down-regulation is an important step toward the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts. On the other hand, increase in the let-7b level by mimic normalizes active breast myofibroblasts, and consequently can be utilized to enhance the efficiency of the classical anti-cancer regimen.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblast cells were obtained and used as previously described.

For qRT-PCR, the RT2 Real-Time\u2122 SYBR Green qPCR mastermix (Roche, Germany) was used for mRNAs, while the Qiagen miScript Syber Green PCR Kit was used for miRNAs, and the amplifications were performed utilizing the light cycler 480 (Roche, Germany). The melting-curve data were collected to check PCR specificity, and the amount of PCR products was measured by threshold cycle (Ct) values and the relative ratio of specific genes to GAPDH (or U6 for mature miRNAs) for each sample was then calculated.

Cell migration and invasion were assessed as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, 2x104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper wells of the CIM-plate with thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration), and a complete media was added to the lower chamber wells used as a chemo-attractant. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in the RTCA for 24 h and the impedance value of each well was automatically monitored by the xCELLigence system and expressed as a Cell index value which represents cell status based on the measured electrical impedance change divided by a background value. Each assay was performed in triplicate.For the proliferation assay, exponentially growing cells (2\u00d7104) were seeded in E-plate with complete medium as per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. All data were recorded and analyzed by the RTCA software. Cell index (CI) was used to measure the change in the electrical impedance divided by the background value to represent cell status. Each assay was performed in triplicate.Immunohistochemistry staining on FFPE tissuesImmunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues was performed using anti-Ki-67 and CD34 antibodies (Abcam) at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:150, respectively, and then slides were stained using automated staining platform (Ventana). Envision + polymer (ready to use; Dako) was used as a secondary antibody. Color was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and instant hematoxylin (Shandon) was used for counterstaining.Orthotopic tumor xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH&RC institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. 10 female nude mice were randomized into 2 groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by coimplantation of the MDA-MB-231 cells (2 \u00d7 106) with TCF-346i or TCF-346c cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of the 4th left fat pad of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper using the following formula (Length X Width X Height).Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in medium without serum for 24 h, and then media were collected and briefly centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at -80\u00b0C until needed.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by student\u2019s t-test and P values of 0.05 and less were considered as statistically significant.QuantificationsThe expression levels of the immunoblotted proteins were measured using the Image J software. Protein signal intensity of each band was determined, and then dividing the obtained value of each band by the values of the corresponding internal control allowed a correction of the loading differences.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNo competing interests are declared by any of the authors.REFERENCESGlobal cancer statistics, 2012Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts: orchestrating the composition of malignancyFibroblasts in cancerThe inflammatory/cancer-related IL-6/STAT3/NF-kappaB positive feedback loop includes AUF1 and maintains the active state of breast myofibroblastsAberrant regulation of the LIN28A/LIN28B and let-7 loop in human malignant tumors and its effects on the hallmarks of cancerDisrupting the pairing between let-7 and Hmga2 enhances oncogenic transformationLet-7 and miR-200 microRNAs: guardians against pluripotency and cancer progressionThe LIN28/let-7 pathway in cancerRegression of murine lung tumors by the let-7 microRNAlet-7 regulates self renewal and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cellsPrognostic significance of let-7b expression in breast cancer and correlation to its target gene of BSG expressionMicroRNAs in cancerBreast cancer and microRNAs: therapeutic impactMicroRNA regulation of human breast cancer stem cellsMicroRNAs as mediators and communicators between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironmentEssential role of miRNAs in orchestrating the biology of the tumor microenvironmentmicroRNA-mediated regulation of the tumor microenvironmentMicroRNA regulation in cancer-associated fibroblastsSTAT3 activation of miR-21 and miR-181b-1 via PTEN and CYLD are part of the epigenetic switch linking inflammation to cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingMiRNA expression analysis of cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts in breast cancerMiR-26b is down-regulated in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts from ER-positive breast cancers leading to enhanced cell migration and invasionRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisp16(INK4A) Represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMicroRNAs reprogram normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts in ovarian cancerEpigenetic silencing of microRNA-149 in cancer-associated fibroblasts mediates prostaglandin E2/interleukin-6 signaling in the tumor microenvironmentMechanisms underlying differential expression of interleukin-8 in breast cancer cellsLet-7b is involved in the inflammation and immune responses associated with Helicobacter pylori infection by targeting Toll-like receptor 4Breast stromal fibroblasts from histologically normal surgical margins are pro-carcinogenicThe role of miR-31 and its target gene SATB2 in cancer-associated fibroblastsBreast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their counterparts display neoplastic-specific changesThe p16INK4a tumor suppressor controls p21WAF1 induction in response to ultraviolet light"

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumour initiation and progression, possibly by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a series of cellular changes that is known to underlie the process of metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether CAFs and surrounding normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) are able to induce EMT markers and functional changes in breast epithelial cancer cells. Matched pairs of CAFs and NBFs were established from fresh human breast cancer specimens and characterised by assessment of CXCL12 levels, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels and response to doxorubicin. The fibroblasts were then co-cultured with MCF7 cells. Vimentin and E-cadherin expressions were determined in co-cultured MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as by western blotting and quantitative PCR. Co-cultured MCF7 cells were also assessed functionally by invasion assay. CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and expressed higher levels of \u03b1-SMA compared with NBFs. CAFs were also less sensitive to doxorubicin as evidenced by less H2AX phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis on flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V compared with NBFs. When co-cultured with MCF7 cells, there was greater vimentin and less E-cadherin expression as well as greater invasiveness in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CAFs compared with those co-cultured with NBFs. CAFs have the ability to induce a greater degree of EMT in MCF7 cell lines, indicating that CAFs contribute to a more malignant breast cancer phenotype and their role in influencing therapy resistance should therefore be considered when treating breast cancer.",

        "title": "Isolation of normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts from fresh tissues by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most prominent cell type within the tumor stroma of many cancers, in particular breast carcinoma, and their prominent presence is often associated with poor prognosis. CAFs are an activated subpopulation of stromal fibroblasts, many of which express the myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. CAFs originate from local tissue fibroblasts as well as from bone marrow-derived cells recruited into the developing tumor and adopt a CAF phenotype under the influence of the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were shown to facilitate tumor initiation, growth and progression through signaling that promotes tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. We demonstrated that CAFs enhance tumor growth by mediating tumor-promoting inflammation, starting at the earliest pre-neoplastic stages. Despite increasing evidence of the key role CAFs play in facilitating tumor growth, studying CAFs has been an on-going challenge due to the lack of CAF-specific markers and the vast heterogeneity of these cells, with many subtypes co-existing in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, studying fibroblasts in vitro is hindered by the fact that their gene expression profile is often altered in tissue culture. To address this problem and to allow unbiased gene expression profiling of fibroblasts from fresh mouse and human tissues, we developed a method based on previous protocols for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Our approach relies on utilizing PDGFR\u03b1 as a surface marker to isolate fibroblasts from fresh mouse and human tissue. PDGFR\u03b1 is abundantly expressed by both normal fibroblasts and CAFs. This method allows isolation of pure populations of normal fibroblasts and CAFs, including, but not restricted to \u03b1-SMA+ activated myofibroblasts. Isolated fibroblasts can then be used for characterization and comparison of the evolution of gene expression that occurs in CAFs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, we and others reported expression profiling of fibroblasts isolated by cell sorting. This protocol was successfully performed to isolate and profile highly enriched populations of fibroblasts from skin, mammary, pancreas and lung tissues. Moreover, our method also allows culturing of sorted cells, in order to perform functional experiments and to avoid contamination by tumor cells, which is often a big obstacle when trying to culture CAFs.",

        "content": "Tumors are supported by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are heterogeneous and carry out distinct cancer-associated functions. Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

Specifically, high rates of metastasis to the lymph nodes, lungs, bone and brain, not the primary tumor, are the leading cause of breast cancer death. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis may lead to more effective strategies for the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer.Growing evidence indicates that malignant breast tissue requires complex local and systemic stromal interactions to provide a tumor-promoting environment during breast carcinoma development and progression. Specifically, tumor stromal cells cross-communicate and develop an aggressive phenotype of cancer cells, which are recognized as an important modulator and even a driver of tumorigenicity. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component of the tumor microenvironment, have been proven to be a major contributor of various processes, such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and drug resistance. These effects are mediated by paracrine stimulation from a variety of growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukins (IL). Our previous study indicated that CAFs stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impaired taxol efficacy in breast cancer by elevating NF-\u03baB/miR-21 signaling. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which CAFs feed the cancer cells and allow them to acquire an aggressive phenotype and the molecular mediators involved in these processes have not been extensively studied.In addition to the several well-documented gene mutations that have been associated with the development of breast cancer, considerable attention is being focused on the participation of epigenetic events, including the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. Highly up-regulated in breast cancer, the lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) mediates H3K27 tri-methylation and the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is considered a key molecule and potential biomarker for breast cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR is reportedly involved in drug resistance and stemness maintenance in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, growing evidence indicates that HOTAIR promotes metastasis breast, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma. Given its critical role during tumor progression, HOTAIR is a novel target for breast cancer therapy.The activation of CDK5 signaling has been implicated in the control of cell motility and metastatic potential, which are significantly correlated with several markers of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that the aberrant activation of CDK5 signaling is associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which was responsible for high-dose taxol-induced invasion and EMT. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of CDK5 remains elusive. Moreover, CDK5 was proven to be essential for TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in breast cancer progression. Strikingly, aberrant CDK5 promoter DNA hypomethylation was identified in the mantle cell lymphoma genome compared with normal naive B cells. These findings indicate an interaction between CDK5 signaling and tumor stromal cells, which may underlie the novel epigenetic mechanism of tumor environment-induced metastasis and hold therapeutic potential in breast cancer.Based on these previous studies, we further demonstrated that CAFs promoted the metastasis of breast cancer cells via paracrine TGF-\u03b21, which is a crucial mediator of the interaction between stromal and cancer cells. Importantly, CAFs transactivated HOTAIR to promote EMT. Strikingly, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4. Additionally, CAFs mediated HOTAIR expression and EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling, and H3K27 trimethylation was highly enriched at the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. Overall, we describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the CAF-induced aggressive behavior of cancer cells, which support the targeting of the TGF-\u03b21/ HOTAIR axis as a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.MethodsCell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The CAFs were isolated and cultured as described previously. CAFs were acquired from four invasive breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), and the use of specimens was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH. CAFs were obtained from tissues that had been cut into small pieces and digested with collagenase type I (1\u2009mg/mL; Sigma) and hyaluronidase (125\u00a0units/mL; Sigma) for 6\u2009h in DMEM without FBS at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After filtering the undigested tissues, the stromal fraction was centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) or RMPI Medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Cytokine antibody arrayThe profiles of cytokines secreted by CAFs were detected in the culture supernatants using a Human Cytokine Array (RayBiotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cytokines with distinct differences in expression were screened out.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The culture medium was removed and used to assess the level of extracellular TGF-\u03b21 with a TGF-\u03b21 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, abcam) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results are expressed in ng/mL.Western blottingThe total protein was extracted with cold radio-immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The cell lysates were separated using 8-10% SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Antibodies against human CDK5, CDK5RAP1, H3K27me3, EZH2 (1:1000 dilutions, Cell Signaling Technology), Egr-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin (1:1000 dilutions, Abcam), and \u03b2-actin (1:4000 dilutions, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. Rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. The antibody-labeled protein bands on membranes were detected with a G-BOX iChemi XT instrument (Syngene).ImmunofluorescenceAfter various treatments, cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100 for 10\u2009min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1\u2009h. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted with antibodies against \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and vimentin (1:100 dilutions, Abcam). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Technologies) secondary antibodies. To detect the formation of stress fibers, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscopes. Cells from three independent experiments in which at least 300 cells were counted were quantified.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the standard protocol. HOTAIR cDNA was obtained from total RNA using the Fast Quant RT Kit (TIANGEN). Real-time PCR was performed using Super Real Pre Mix Plus SYBR Green (TIANGEN) on an ABI-7500 Real-time PCR machine (Life Technologies).The following thermocycling protocol was employed: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 40\u00a0cycles. GAPDH was used as the internal control. Data are presented as fold changes (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct) and were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software V 2.02 (MJ Research).Wound-healing assayApproximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 cells or 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MCF-7 cells were plated in six-well plates after different treatments. A linear scratch/wound was made on the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs of live cells were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification, and the distance migrated was observed after 48\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h.Matrigel invasion assayThe Matrigel invasion assay was performed in 24-well Transwell culture plates. Briefly, 40\u2009\u03bcL of Matrigel (1\u2009mg/mL, BD) was applied to 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane filters. Approximately 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MDA-MB-231 cells or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MCF-7 cells were resuspended and then seeded in 24-well Transwell plates containing FBS-free medium in the upper chamber and complete growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the lower chamber for 24\u00a0h or 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Non-invading cells were removed from the upper surfaces of the invasion membranes, and the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin. The average number of cells per field was determined by counting the cells in six random fields per well. Cells were counted in four separate fields in three independent experiments.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)The expression of HOTAIR in paraffin-embedded sections and cells of different conditions seeded on the sterile coverslips for 48\u00a0h was examined in situ hybridization. First, we deparaffinized and rehydrated the samples. Before digesting samples with proteinase K, we used 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the paraffin-embedded sections and DEPC water to fix the cell samples. We then hybridized samples with a 5\u2019Cy3-labeled modified HOTAIR probe (6\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After completing the hybridization, the samples were successively washed twice with solution buffer (2\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7, chloride sodium citrate buffer) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min each. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using an FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)The EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) was used to perform the ChIP assays. Briefly, 1% formaldehyde was used to fix cells, and 0.125\u00a0M glycine was then used to neutralize the formaldehyde. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer with SDS and protease inhibitors. Soluble chromatins of 200-1000\u00a0bp were collected after sonication and pre-cleared in 1:10 dilution buffer, followed by incubation with IgG, H3K27me3 and EZH2 anti-bodies on a rotating platform overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing the immunocomplexes captured by protein G-Sepharose beads, the bound DNA fragments were eluted for real-time qPCR analysis using ChIP primer.Luciferase reporter assayThe upstream 2.5\u2009kb promoter regions of HOTAIR were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (GV238 vector), and the mutations of predicted SMADs binding sites were also cloned into the same luciferase reporter vector. Cells were co-transfected with SMAD plasmid GV219 vector and HOTAIR plasmid (wild type or mutant) for 24\u00a0h, and the promoter activities were examined with a luciferase assay.Orthotopic nude mouse models and treatmentBALB/c nude mice aged 4-6\u00a0weeks were purchased from the Animal Center at the Cancer Institute at Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Lenti-HOTAIR or Lenti NC and CAFs were injected into the mammary fat pads of each nude mouse at a ratio of 1:3. The mice were imaged for luciferase activity with an IVIS imaging system once per week.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry analysisThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to an immunohistochemistry analysis. After blocking with 3% H2O2 and non-immune rabbit serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by a streptavidin-biotinylated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The chromogenic substrate was developed with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine, andhematoxylin was used for counter staining. The results were visualized using a light microscope.Statistical analysesSPSS 16.0 (IBM, USA) was used for all calculations. All values are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made using Student\u2019s t-test, and differences among groups were assessed with a two-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significance was set to P\u2009<\u20090.05.*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01.ResultsParacrine TGF-\u03b21 was essential for CAFs to promote the metastasis of breast cancer cellsTGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated cells. a Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of CAFs. b The top ten cytokine secreted by CAFs. Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of MCF-7 (c), MDA-MB-231(e) and by treatment of CAF-CM. Relative signal intensity of top ten increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (d), MDA-MB-231(f), compared to the control cellsDuring breast cancer progression, CAFs may supply appropriate signals that may promote the development of aggressive phenotypes in carcinoma cells and establish a complex scenario, which culminates in metastasis. To identify the cytokines secreted by CAFs that enhance tumorigenic ability, the cytokine profiles of cell supernatants from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and treatment with conditioned media of CAFs (CAF-CM) were analyzed using a RayBiotech Human Cytokine Antibody Array. The top four cytokines secreted in the supernatant of CAFs were TGF-\u03b21, IGFBP-4, IGF-1 and PDGF-AA (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in both CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (Fig. 1c, d) as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to control cells (Fig.1e, f).To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, the distribution of TGF-\u00df1 in clinic samples was performed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). It\u2019s well documented that CAFs strongly expressed \u03b1-SMA, whereas were negative for the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin-7 and TGF-\u00df1 showed that the red fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 colocalized with green fluorescence of \u03b1-SMA, but not with cytokeratin-7 in both invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. More important, much more and stronger fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 was detected in invasive breast carcinoma, compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively, these results indicated that TGF-\u00df1may be secreted by CAFs.Paracrine TGF-\u03b21 was enssential for CAFs induced EMT. a The amount of TGF-\u03b21 released into the cell culture supernatant of cells treated with CAF-CM was determined by ELISA. b The wound-healing assay of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor SB431542 (SB) or pirfenidone (PFD), respectively. c SB or PFD treatment impaired the CAF-mediated increase in invading cancer cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. d Western blotting analysis for E-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b2-catenin of cells treated as in (b). e Immunofluorescence staining showed that treatment with SB or PFD increased E-cadherin levels, decreased vimentin and nuclear \u03b2-catenin distribution in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. CAFs promoted F-actin polymerization and stability in cancer cells, whereas treatment with SB or PFD impaired the formation of stress fibers. Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcmDue to the changes of quantity and quality in CAFs from different patients, we extracted CAFs from four invasive breast carcinomas patients to reduce the original difference in this study (Additional file 1: Figure S2). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with conditioned media of CAF1#, CAF2#, CAF3# and CAF4#, respectively. ELISA further confirmed all of the four CAFs populations induced significant increased TGF-\u03b21 level in the supernatants from CAF-CM-treated cells (mean value: 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 6.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.243\u00a0ng/ml in MCF-7 cells; 0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 4.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0ng/ml in MDA-MB-231 cells) (Fig.\u00a02a, Additional file 1: Figure S3). We then further evaluated the role of TGF-\u03b21 in CAFs induced EMT of cancer cells. We found that TGF-\u03b21 treatment achieved similar enhanced the migratory activity of cancer cell, compared with CAF-CM treated cells (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the small-molecule inhibitors of TGF-\u03b21, SB451332 (SB) or Pirfenidone (PFD) treatment abrogated the CAF-CM induced promotion of cell migration. Moreover, all of the four CAFs populations were competent in enhancing the cell invasive ability, while the number of invading cells was deceased 2- to 3.5-fold in SB or PFD treated cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Figure S4). Moreover, SB and PDF treatment markedly rescued the induction of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin expression as well as the repression of E-cadherin in CAF-CM-treated cells (Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescent images showed that SB or PFD treatment decreased the nuclear signals of \u00df-catenin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the nuclear translocation to the cytoplasm was promoted (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the remodeling and polarization of F-actin was observed after CAF stimulation, whereas the formation of a stress fiber pattern was abolished after SB or PFD treatment. These results identified TGF-\u03b21 as a crucial mediator of the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer cells and TGF-\u03b21 was necessary for CAFs to induce EMT of cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT by activating the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cellsCAFs enhanced the expression of the lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cells to induce EMT. a The expression of seveal metastasis associated LncRNAs treated with CAF-CM was measured by RC-PCR. HOTAIR levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells upon treatment with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, SB or PFD was measured by real-time RT-PCR (b) or FISH (c). Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. d Western blotting indicated that the EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression levels were significantly increased in CAF-CM-treated cells. e The expression levels of the indicated epithelial or mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were measured by western blotting. f The depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invaded cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. Quantitation of invasive MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. For each measurement, \u2265\u200910 fields of view with \u2265\u2009100 cells were analyzed; *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01The epigenetic regulation of lncRNA triggered invasion and metastasis in breast cancer. To study the epigenetic mechanism by which CAFs induce EMT in cancer cells, the expression of several lncRNAs were measured by RT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a). Specifically, CAF-CM resulted in the largest increases in HOTAIR expression, 3.5- and 8.7-fold increases inMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to the control cells. Similar to CAF-CM, recombinant TGF-\u03b21 also increased the levels of HOTAIR (Fig. 3b). However, the CAF-CM mediated activation of HOTAIR was attenuated after SB or PFD treatment. FISH images revealed that SB or PFD repressed the nuclear distribution of HOTAIR induced by CAF-CM (Fig. 3c), and Western blotting analysis indicated that the protein levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 were notably increased (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the induction of E-cadherin and repression of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin was observed in HOTAIR knock-down cells (Fig. 3e), and the depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invading cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 3f, Additional file 1: Figure S5). Based on these data, we concluded that CAFs promoted metastasis by activating HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which CAFs activate HOTAIR remain to be addressed.HOTAIR is a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4CAFs activated the transcription of HOTAIR by SMAD2/3/4. a Western blotting analysis of the effect of recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, SB or PFD treatment on the p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. b The HOTAIR expression upon treatment of siRNA against SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 was determined by real time PCR. c SMAD2/3/4 were enriched in the promoter of HOTAIR in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, as determined by a CHIP assay. d A bioinformatics assay showed the predicted binding sites of SMAD2/3/4 within the HOTAIR promoter region. e A mutational analysis of HOTAIR promoter activity. The wild-type and mutant promoter constructs were co-transfected with SMAD2, 3, or 4 plasmids into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assayTGF-\u03b2 is known to assemble a receptor complex that activates Smads thereby assembling multi-subunit complexes that regulate transcription. Western blotting analysis indicated that the levels of phosphorylated of Smad2 protein (p-SMAD2), p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4were significantly elevated in CAF-CM and TGF-\u03b21-treated cancer cells, suggesting that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a04a). However, the repression of p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 was detected in cells treated with SB or PFD. Moreover, RT-PCR showed a 50-60% reduction in HOTAIR expression in cells transfected with SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 siRNA (Fig. 4b). To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying CAF-induced HOTAIR activation, we used ChIP technology to identify the genomic locations bound by SMADs in cancer cells before and after co-culture with CAF-CM. The ChIP results indicated that CAFs stimulate the direct binding of SMAD2, 3, and 4 to the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4c), and a promoter analysis using JASPAR and PROMO indicated several candidate SMAD binding sites in the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4d). The relative profile score threshold set as 80% in JASPAR and the maximum matrix dissimilarity rate set as 15% in PROMO. Accordingly, the deletion of predicted binding sites (Mut-1 and Mut-2) within the HOTAIR promoter region decreased SMAD2/3/4 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the deletion of the remaining mutant binding sites did not result in significant differences compared with control group (Fig. 4e). Therefore, we concluded that SMADs directly bind the promoter site of HOTAIR located between nucleotides -386 and -398, -440 and -452 (the genome coordinates: chr12: 53975342-53975354, chr12: 53975396-53975408), and consequently induced the transactivation of HOTAIR.Based on these results, we elucidated that CAFs transactivated HOTAIR via the secretion TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4.CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signalingCAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling. a Western blotting indicated that CDK5 expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 expression levels were greatly decreased. b The histone methylation status of CDK5 signaling was determined with a CHIP assay, which indicated that H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, whereas the depletion of HOTAIR blocked this function of CAFs. The results are presented as the fold-change over the control. c ChIP analysis revealed that elevated EZH2 was recruited to the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. All experiments were repeated three times. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. negative controlWe previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. Consistent with our previous study, CDK5 protein expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the levels of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 were greatly decreased (Fig.\u00a05a). These findings suggest that the activation of CDK5 was essential for CAF-induced EMT. To investigate the epigenetic events that were involved in the activation of CDK5 in breast cancer, we first examined the histone methylation status using ChIP assays (Fig. 5b). Profiling histone methylation marks on the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter by qChIP showed that H3K27me3 is highly enriched at the promoter of both genes in CAF-CM treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells compared with the control cells. Whereas the depletion of HOTAIR rescued the effect of CAFs, the H3K27me3 levels at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter were remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the recruitment of EZH2 to the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was measured, which indicated that the level of PRC2 components at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was significantly decreased (Fig. 5c). Based on these data, we demonstrated that the activation of CDK5 was required for CAF-mediated EMT. Specifically, CAFs stimulated CDK5 expression by H3K27 trimethylation on the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling.Knock-down HOTAIR inhibited CAF-induced tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivoThe depletion of HOTAIR suppressed CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. a Representative pseudocolor bioluminescence images of tumor size were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors of MDA-MB-231-Luc cells were transfected with control shRNA or shHOTAIR. Each group included eight mice (n\u2009=\u20098). Primary tumor volumes (b) and representative bioluminescence images (BLI) (c) were evaluated. d Lung metastasis was detected by bioluminescent imaging on days 35 and 42. e Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained lung tissues. f The expression of HOTAIR was assessed by FISH. g Representative images of the immunohistochemical staining of CDK5, EZH2, \u00df-catenin, H3K27me3, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 in tissues. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcmTo study the epigenetic mechanism of CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, an MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established in nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging was monitored weekly and indicated that all of the four CAF populations remarkably promoted primary tumor growth, whereas shHOTAIR treatment markedly reduced tumor volume (Fig.\u00a06a-c, Additional file 1: Figure S6). Most importantly, CAFs resulted in dramatic lung metastasis with extensive tumor foci compared to control cells, as determined by quantitative bioluminescence images (Fig. 6d). However, this metastatic phenomenon was attenuated when HOTAIR was knocked down, and H&E staining further confirmed these results (Fig. 6e). Compared to the control group, CAFs enhanced the nuclear staining of HOTAIR, as revealed by FISH, which further confirmed our in vitro study (Fig. 6f). Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed the downregulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and reductions in p-SMAD2-, p-SMAD3-, EZH2- and H3K27me3- positive cells in the shHOTAIR group (Fig. 6g). Taken together, these findings indicate that shHOTAIR treatment efficiently blocked the crosstalk between CAFs and tumor cells, thereby impairing CAF-induced EMT. Collectively, these experiments supported the notion that the secretion TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD pathway in breast cancer cells, resulting in the up-regulation of HOTAIR transcription and histone modification of the CDK5 signaling pathway, thereby promoting breast cancer progression and metastasis.Aberrant HOTAIR correlated with a poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancerOverexpressed HOTAIR correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. a HOTAIR expression was analyzed by FISH. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. b Immunohistochemistry staining detected EZH2, CDK5, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 expression in 59 breast carcinoma samples (39 with lymph node metastasis, 19 in situ carcinoma)To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, we collected 59 breast carcinoma samples and examined markers of CAFs FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA by immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression levels of FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA were significantly up-regulated in invasive breast carcinoma (97.5%, 38 in 39), compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 33.3%, 7 of 20), suggesting that CAFs facilitated tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Compared to DCIS, HOTAIR expression and nuclear staining were higher in metastatic breast carcinoma, as revealed by FISH images, which indicated that the upregulation of HOTAIR strongly correlated with tumor metastasis (Fig.\u00a07a). Furthermore, the expression levels of EZH2 and CDK5 exhibited similar patterns, which further confirmed our in vitro and in vivo studies (Fig. 7b).DiscussionThe proposed model of the paracrine and epigenetic mechanism of CAFs induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. CAFs secreted high levels of TGF-\u03b21, resulting in the transactivation of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells, consequently enhanced metastasisBased on our results, we propose a model of the CAF-mediated upregulation of HOTAIR transcription in breast cancer cells that promotes invasion and metastasis via the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 (Fig.\u00a08). The hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b21 signaling clearly contributes to tumor metastasis and the metabolic reprogramming and activation of CAFs. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 has been linked to poor clinical outcome and is required for the CAF-mediated initiation of efficient metastasis. Consistent with these results, our data further indicate that the key pro-metastatic function of CAFs depends on TGF-\u03b21 secretion (Fig. 2). Specifically, blocking TGF-\u03b21 secretion with SB or PFDefficiently abrogated CAF-mediated metastasis. Our study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 is a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment.Non-coding RNAs have been added to the growing list of gene regulators that contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, mounting evidence has revealed that the up-regulation of HOTAIR contributed to drug resistance and tumor metastasis in various types of solid tumors. In this study, our experiment demonstrated that CAFs upregualted HOTAIR expression via TGF-\u03b21 secretion, supporting its importance in breast cancer progression (Fig. 3b-f). Most importantly, SMAD2/3/4 directly bound the promoter site of HOTAIR, as revealed by CHIP and luciferase reporter assay, suggesting that HOTAIR was a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4 (Fig. 4c and e). These findings suggested that the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs clearly led to the transactivation of HOTAIR expression. And the breast cancer microenvironment plays a key role in maintaining HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. Our studies provide a strong body of evidence to support that the modulation of epigenetic control and targeted alterations of HOTAIR represent novel therapeutic targets in breast cancer.Extensive reports have identified several microRNA induced by CAFs (e.g., miR-26b, miR-148a and miR-133b) that were invovled in tumor progression. Specifically, our previous study verified that CAFs impaired taxol efficacy by activating miR-21 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe that the CAF-mediated expression of long non-coding RNA led to enhanced cell migration and invasion.We previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of CDK5 activation has not been fully elucidated. In cancer, gene expression profiles revealed a loss of tumor suppressor gene expression due to aberrant histone modification. Specifically, Kumar et al. reported that H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter of CDK5 was a key mechanism underlying cocaine-induced plasticity in the striatum. In the present study, we proved that CAFs mediated the transcription of HOTAIR, leading to a strong increase in the H3K27-mediated trimethylation of the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoters, thereby activating CDK5 expression and EMT.Although our study focuses on the TGF-\u03b21, CAFs may also secrete a cocktail of additional pro-metastatic factors, such as IL-6 and IGF-II, to contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, additional crucial lncRNAs involved in the development of breast cancer remain to be investigated.ConclusionsCAFs may orchestrate multiple non-coding RNA and signaling pathways to control several biological processes in a paracrine manner during breast cancer progression. We reported here that secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs was a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal cells and cancer cells to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. Our study revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis, the TGF-\u00df1/HOTAIR axis controls the development and progression of breast cancer, which supports the pursuit of these molecules as targets of breast cancer treatment.Additional fileAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerCAFsCarcinoma associated fibroblastsDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumEMTEpithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionFBSFetal bovine serumHOTAIRHOX transcript antisense RNAPBSPhosphate-buffered salinePCRPolymerase chain reactionPFDPirfenidoneSBSB431542Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12943-018-0758-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Authors\u2019 contributionsMM,CSK and YR conceived and designed this study.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

Tumor microenvironment is a whole system which includes tumor cells, stroma cells (such as, adipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, infiltrating immune cells) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the activated fibroblasts, which were named by Tlsty\u2019s group in the tissue of prostatic cancer in 1999, are the primary type of host cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were found in almost all solid tumor tissue (e.g. cancers of the colon, lung, liver, prostate, pancreas and gastric cancer), and play an assignable role in tumor development by cell-cell interaction or cross-talk with tumor cells through secreting growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, CAFs are thought to be \u201cthe dark side of coin\u201d in tumor development.In contrast to normal fibroblasts, CAFs have some of phenotypical and functional abnormality. These alterations of CAFs may be due to its stable gene expression changes. So, whole breast carcinomas stromal by microdissection were explored to analyze the gene expression profiling. These studies have led to new classifications and risk stratification of breast carcinomas into several molecular subtypes based on their gene expression signatures. The global gene expression in the stromal cells has also been shown to powerfully predict prognosis and treatment response. A variety of differences have been identified between breast carcinoma-associated stroma and its paired normal mammary stroma, primarily resulting in increased expression of cytokines (EGF, HGF PDGF, TLL-12, SSP-1, POSTN, CXCL-12, and CXCL14), extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (FBN1, FB2M, SPARC, ADRA2A and ADM) and proteases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-13). These factors were involved in cross-talk between stromal cells and tumor cells by directly or indirectly pattern to promote tumor cell proliferation, cell adhesion and invasion, ECM remodeling. Although, these studies give us the overall configuration of the tumor microenvironment, there are still poor on the role of each member in the tumor stroma, like CAFs, to contribute to the tumor development.Until most recently, the distinguishable features and gene expression profile of CAFs and NFs have been described in breast cancer by Bauer et al.. Their studies show that up-regulated WISP1, collagen type-X (COL10A) and TGF-\u03b2 isoforms in CAFs activate paracrine Wnt-1 signaling in human breast cancer cells or lead to abnormal ECM production in stroma separately. Loss of expression of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 may alter the hormonal milieu in breast carcinomas, and down-regulation of KLF4 participates in the differentiation of resting fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. However, there is still no systematic analysis of the intrinsic relationship between breast cancer CAFs function and its abnormal signaling pathway. The extreme complexity of breast cancer CAFs feature and its roles to tumor development are needed to be further investigated. Furthermore, whether these previous finding in CAFs derived from western country women are also existed in patients of other races.In light of these facts, the principal purpose of this work is to investigate the possible innate nature of biological and genetic heterogeneity between human breast CAFs versus matched NFs in Chinese women. We identified 824 differentially expressed genes: 809 of these were up-regulated, and 15 were down-regulated in CAFs, which included 8 cytokines. The abnormality of CAFs genes and its associated signaling pathways could be involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, signal transduction and protein transport, which were proved in CAFs of other tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we firstly discovered that the altered ATM signaling pathway, which was recently found related to reactive oxidative stress (ROS), is abnormally activation in the early stage of breast cancer. Cell cycle regulated signaling, such as P53 signaling pathway, RB tumor suppressor/checkpoint signaling, regulation of cell cycle progression by Plk3, Cdc25 and Chk1 regulatory pathway are identified to be changed in CAFs. A set of immune associated signaling are abnormality in CAFs, which include natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules. And more importantly, we found that CAFs would be able to promote breast cancer cell invasion under co-culture condition through up-regulated CCL18.Materials and MethodsTissue SamplesAll the human breast tumor tissues and its adjacent normal mammary tissues were collected at the time of surgical reaction at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. None of the patients received adjuvant therapy before surgery. Specimens used in this study were approved by the Ethics committees of Chongqing Medical University.Isolation and Culture of Primary FibroblastsTumor tissue and paired normal mammary tissues were washed 3 times with sterile PBS with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamycin). The tissues were minced with sterile scissors in a fresh sterile culture dish. After digestion with 0.1% collagenase type I (C0130, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 8\u201312 h, tissues were carefully pipetted up and down for a couple of times using culture medium. The mixtures were centrifuged and washed with DMEM to remove the fat and tissue debris. Then, the mammary tissues were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Australia) for about two days. Removed the suspending cells or tissue, the most adherent cells were fibroblasts. The primary fibroblasts isolated from tumor tissues were named \u201cCAFs\u201d, and from tumor paired normal tissues named \u201cNFs\u201d. Cell purity was identified by immunohistochemistry for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence staining for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP following the standard described process previously and manufacture\u2019s protocols. Briefly, cells were grown on cover slips for 24 hours and fixed within 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1% triton-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1\u2236150) for targeting fibronectin (F3648, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam Cambridge) and FAP (ab53066, Abcam Cambridge, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) at 4\u00b0C for overnight. After washing with PBS, cells were then stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1\u2236100, ZF-0311, Zhongshan Goldenbrdge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and DAPI. Immunofluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80 i microscope (Eclipse 80 i, Tokyo, Japan; magnification\u00d7100).MTT and Flow Cytometric AnalysisCell growth was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Cells were plated into 96-well plate at 5\u00d7103 cells per well in 200 \u00b5l of complete growth medium. Cell growth was measured every day. Incubating for the designed time, MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. After careful removal of the medium, 0.1 ml of isopropanol with 0.04 N of HCl was added to each well, and the plates were shaken on a rotator for 20 min at room temperature. The absorbance was recorded on an ultraviolet spectrophotometric reader at a wavelength of 570 nm. The independent experiments were repeated for five times.S-phase was analyzed by using laser scanning cytometry. Cells were processed by standard methods using propidium iodide staining of cell DNA as previously described. A minimum of 20,000 events was collected to maximize the statistical validity of the compartmental analysis. Triplicate independent experiments were done.Preparation of Conditioned MediumMDA-MB-231 cells, CAFs and NFs were cultured in complete growth DMEM for 48 h to approximately 80% confluence. The medium was changed to 0.5% FBS DMEM and cells were kept in culture for another 30 to 36 h. For neutralization experiments, neutralizing antibodies against human CXCL-12 (500 ng/ml), CCL18 (10 \u00b5g/ml), CCL4 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) and control IgG (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were separately preincubated at 37\u00b0C with supernatant for 1 h before performing migration assays. The medium was centrifuged at 1,200\u00d7g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM).Cell Migration and Invasion AssayCell invasion or migration assay was measured via modified Boyden chamber assay as described previously. Briefly, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 cells in 200 \u00b5l serum-free medium were seeded in the wells of 8 \u00b5m-pore membrance modified Boyden chambers (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) coated with ECM (1\u22367.5) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 10% FBS Medium, CM, CM with secreting factor CXCL-12 (100 nM), CCL18 (500 ng/ml) or CCL4 (100 nM) was separately added into the lower or upper chamber as the designed purpose. After 6 h or 12 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C and CO2 at 5%, cells adhered to the upper surface of the filter were removed using a cotton applicator. Stained with hematoxylin in methanol, the invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were counted. The data represent at least three experiments done in triplicate (mean\u00b1standard error).RNA Isolation, Quantitative Real-time PCR and Microarray AnalysisTotal RNA isolated from six paired CAFs and NFs using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA quantity was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometry. Probe synthesis and hybridization performed as the manufacture\u2019s instruction were used to probe the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (44 K; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data were generated after scanning by using an Agilent Scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.5 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The raw data were normalized using quantize normalization and then analyzed by GeneSpring GX v10.0 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Paired Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) was applied to identify differentially expressed mRNA in CAFs and NFs. SAM output was filtered by q\u200a=\u200a0.1. Heatmap.2 function (R v2.14.0, gplots package v2.9.0) was used to plot the scaled expression data of differentially expressed mRNAs.An additional two expression datasets (GSE20086 and GSE29270) on breast cancer associated fibroblasts were downloaded from the GEO website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The raw data of six matched CAFs and NFs in GSE20086 were normalized using the R package gcRMA, GCRMA normalized. The author\u2019s processed data of 15 matched CAFs and NFs in GSE29270 were used in next analysis. Paired SAM were also used to analysis the different expression genes in CAFs versus NFs. In cytokines analysis process, the genes at least fold change >1.5 with an estimated FDR<10% were considered as dysregulated genes.RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). To confirm the differential gene expression pattern revealed by microarray analysis, 9 of randomly selected genes (CDC6, FLI1, S100A9, CDK1, PLK1, MMP9, PECAM1, SHC2 and C9ORF135) were re-proved by qRT-PCR assay. Specific Real-time PCR primers for each of selected genes were listed as Table 1. qRT-PCR was performed by a Bio-Rad CFX Manager instrument (Applied Biosystems) at 94\u00b0C for 15 Sec, Tm\u00b0C for 20 Sec and at 65\u00b0C for 30 Sec using SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II (Takara, Dalian, China).

The ELISA assay was carried out in duplicate in three separate experiments.Gene Ontology and Pathway AnalysisFor detection of significantly over-represented GO biological processes, the Onto-Express analysis tool was used and the permutated P-value cut-off was set below 0.05. The pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs was conducted through the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool and the significantly changed signaling pathways were selected based on P<0.01.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was done using SPSS standard version 13.0 software. Data was shown as means \u00b1 SD from at least three independent determinations. Significance of difference was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant differences.ResultsIsolation and Identification of CAFs and NFsCAFs and their paired NFs were successfully isolated from six primary breast carcinomas and from adjacent normal breast tissue. The primary fibroblasts were successfully cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Both CAFs and NFs could be grown for at least 10 passages. Both CAFs and NFs showed spindle-like morphology (Fig. 1A). But the senescence-like cell would be appeared when the cell culture was more than 6 passages (Data not shown).Characterization of fibroblasts isolated from human breast tissue samples.A. Representative cell morphology of CAFs and NFs. B. Identification of CAFs using fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, and CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP by immunofluorescence staining. C. The biomarker gene expression in CAFs and NFs was re-proved by qTR-PCR, and its relative fold change in CAFs and NFs was displayed. The CAFs and NFs are positive for fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP are high expression in CAFs (magnification 100\u00d7 (cell morphology); 200\u00d7 (Biomarker immunofluorescence staining).The purity of CAFs was identified by fibronectin, which is the fibroblast biomarkers, and CAFs-specific biomarkers including \u03b1-SMA and FAP, respectively. NF and CAFs were positive for fibronectin, more than 95% of CAFs were stained by \u03b1-SMA and FAP (Fig. 1B). These biomarker expression changes were reproved by qRT-PCR in 3 paired of CAFs and NF (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrated that the purified CAFs were isolated from tumor tissue.The Noticeable Heterogeneity of Proliferation, Migration and Invasion between CAFs and NFsThe cell growth assay revealed that CAFs were endowed a significantly growth rate than that of NFs in the same culture conditions (P<0.05; Fig. 2A). The percentage of cells in the S phases measured by flow cytometry was significantly higher in CAFs (33.3\u00b17.1, N>3) compared with NFs (6.6\u00b12.5, N>3) (P<0.05). These data suggested that CAFs had a stronger capacity for proliferation than their paired NFs (Fig. 2B\u2013C). Similarly, CAFs had strong potent ability of migration (Fig. 3A\u2013B) and invasion (Fig. 3C) than its paired NFs.Significant difference of proliferation between CAFs and NFs.A. Cell proliferation determined by MTT assay for three of CAFs and NFs. B. Representative DNA content of CAFs and NFs were tested by flow cytometry. C. The percentages of cells in each of cell cycle phases shown by histogram for CAFs vs. NFs. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u22653 separate experiments (**P<0.01).The migration and invasion of CAFs compared with NFs.A. Cell migration capability was determined by wound healing assay. B. The distance of wound closure (compared with control at 0 h) was measured in four-independent wound sites each group after 24 h. C.

(**P<0.01), (magnification A. 100\u00d7; C. 200\u00d7).CAFs Stimulate Tumor Cell Growth, Migration and InvasionIn order to understand the interaction cross-talk of CAFs with tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, co-culture system was employed to display their role in the cell proliferation and invasion. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from NFs (NFs CM) and control, MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from CAFs (CAFs CM) had significant proliferation (P<0.05; Fig. 4A) assayed by cell growth curve. The proportion of MDA-MB-231 cells in the DNA synthesis (S) phase cultured in CAFs CM (29.8\u00b10.8, N\u200a=\u200a3) was obviously more than that in NFs CM (13.0\u00b12.2, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.01) and control (23.5\u00b11.4, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.05) (Fig. 4B\u2013C). Collectively these studies demonstrate that CAFs had a stronger capacity promoting tumor cell proliferation than their paired NFs in the breast tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the increasing cell invasion was found in the co-culture system of MDA-MB-231 cells with CAFs CM, as compared with the system containing NFs CM or control medium (Fig. 5A\u2013D).CAFs promote proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in co-culture system compared with NFs.A.

The migrated MDA-MB-231 cells were checked by Transwell assay (B) in the co-culture system using condition medium derived from CAFs and NFs. And (D) the migrated cells shown by histogram. E, F. The invasive potential of CAFs and NFs were determined by Transwell assay (E) in the co-culture system using condition medium derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. The histogram to show the average migrated cells each view (F). Data is representative of 5 views (**P<0.01), (magnification: A, B 100\u00d7; E 200\u00d7).To examine whether tumor cells play a role in the biologic behavior of fibroblasts in the stroma, the effect of MDA-MB-231 on the migration of CAFs and NFs was compared. As predicted, more migrated cells were tested in the co-culture of CAFs and CM from MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 5E\u2013F). These data indicated that different effects existed in the cross-talk of tumor cells and fibroblasts.Genes Differentially Expressed between CAFs and NFsTo reveal the essence of the heterogeneity of biologic characteristic between CAFs and NFs in the breast carcinoma microenvironment, gene expression profile was investigated by micro-array assay. Total RNA derived from six paired CAFs and NFs isolated from primary breast infiltrating ductal carcinomas of grade \u0399\u0399 were used in this analysis. Gene expression profiles of pooled CAFs and their pooled normal counterparts were obtained by microarray analysis using the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (Fig. 6A). A total of 25,206 probe sets (transcripts) were present in human breast carcinomas-derived fibroblasts relative to their normal controls. Compared with the expression profile of NFs, 809 up-regulated genes (0.9%) and only 15 down-regulated genes (0.45%) were detected in CAFs using an arbitrary cutoff line of signal log ratio of \u22651.8 or \u2264\u22121.8. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), cell division cycle 6 homolog (CDC6); Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1); S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), matrix metallo peptidase 9 (MMP9), and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) were predominantly over-expressed at high levels in CAFs whereas SHC transforming protein 2 (SHC2) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 135 (C9ORF135) were down-regulated with a high array intensity (Table S1 and Table S2).Gene heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs.A. HeatMap of gene expression data obtained by Agilent micro-arrays analysis from CAF and NF isolated from all six cases (BCa 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were subjected to unsupervised cluster analysis. B. The mRNA levels of 9 genes selected randomly were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C. Signaling pathway analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathway in CAFs vs. NFs.The up-regulated genes encoded for secreted proteins were mostly classified into groups of extracellular region, cell proliferation, and signal transducer activity (Table S3). To validate the microarray data, the expression level of 9 randomly selected genes including 7 of up-regulated genes and 2 of down-regulated genes were re-proved by qRT-PCR between CAFs and NFs (Fig. 6B). Compared with NFs, the expression pattern of all differentially expressed genes in CAFs detected by qRT-PCR was consistent with the microarray results.The Unanimity Heterogeneity of Biological Characteristics and Genes Expressed in CAFsMicroarray assay displayed that most genes up-regulated in CAFs have oncogenic function, including growth factors (FGF2, VEGFC, PDGFC, CASC5, and HGFAC), transcription regulators (MKX, RUNX3, ATAD2, FOXM1, and PTTG1), cell proliferation-associated genes (CENPF, PLK1, BUB1, KIF15, and CRIP1) and members of the Wnt signal pathway (WNT1, WNT5A, LRP6, TCF4, and GBP4). Several genes encoding secreted proteins, such as CCL18, CXCL12, MCM10, ADAMDEC1, MMP9, and S100A9 were also significantly up-regulated in CAFs (Table S3). All of these secreted proteins are able to induce cell proliferation, implying that CAFs play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells.Additionally, microarray results suggest that CAFs may facilitate invasion and metastasis of breast tumor cells. The data listing in Table S1 shows that CAFs promote tumor cell invasion mainly via two of mechanisms: (a) altering tumor microenvironment interactions (tumor-stroma and tumor-tumor) by increasing cell adhesion (PECAM1, ITGAX, CCL4, LPP, and SIGLEC8) and cell-cell interaction signaling (CCL18, DLGAP5, C1QA, STAB1, and TEK), and (b) promoting extracellular region degradation (LYZ, C1QB, MMP9, IGLL1, and IGHG1) surrounding tumor cells (Table S3).Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathways showed that CAFs enriched many serviceable signaling pathways in contrast to NFs in human breast cancer. Maximum change pathways in CAFs were cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathways associated with cell cycle. Compared with NFs, the cell cycle and DNA replication signal pathway in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times, respectively. The alteration of the ATM signaling pathway was absolute significantly. It was recently reported that the ATM signaling was activated under oxidative stress. Our preliminary data indicated that activated ATM signaling was in responsible for cell proliferation of fibroblasts (Data not shown). The change of other pathways was also assignable, such as DNA replication signal pathways, chemokine signaling pathways, PI3k signaling pathways, abnormal activated p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 6C). Herein, the heterogeneity of genes expressed between CAFs and NFs was consistent with their heterogeneity of biological characteristics.The Common Cytokines-CCL18 Obtained by Compared with Published Microarray DataTo compare the shared genes in current work with previous publication in breast cancer CAFs, the mRNA microarray data of breast cancer CAFs and its paired NFs stored in National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE20086 and GSE29270) were used. As shown in Fig. 7, the dysregulated genes of CAFs are 136 (M Bauer), 1339 (M Basik), and 1102 in current work, respectively. The shared dysregulated genes among each of these data were 12 (Bauer\u2019s data vs. Basik\u2019s data), 7 (Local data vs. Bauer\u2019s data), and 93 (Local data vs. Basik\u2019s data). These data indicate that high heterogeneity is indeed existed in the CAFs of breast cancer. The similarity was found for cytokines and chemokines genes in the CAFs. The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained in comparing the current data with Basik\u2019s microarray data.The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained by compared with published microarray data.The number of dysregulated difference genes and shared genes from current work and two other studies in breast cancer associated CAF versus paired NF was displayed in each group. Dysregulated Cytokines in each study were listed. Only the common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained compared local data with Basik\u2019s microarray data (GSE29270).CAFs Provide a Suitable Microenvironment for Tumor Cell InvasionImmune-related genes, including various chemokines (CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18), are also differentially expressed in CAFs (Fig. 6C and 8A). Chemokines secreted by stromal cells surrounding tumor tissue have been associated with tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis through cross-talk between tumor and stromal cells. To understand whether CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18 involving in the cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells, tumor cell invasion was analyzed in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231, or NFs and MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 8B and 8D, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 immunoneutralizing antibody in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 reduced tumor cell invasion by nearly 60%. However, Condition medium (CM) with neutralizing antibody CCL4 had no significantly affect on tumor cell invasion. On the other hand, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 ligand, not CCL4 ligand in the co-culture system of NFs and MDA-MB-231 enhanced transmigration of tumor cells by around 3-fold (Fig. 8C and 8E). Collectively, these studies indicate that the up-regulated chemokine genes in CAFs have contributed to suitable microenvironments for tumor cell invasion.CCL18 and CXCL12 secreted by CAFs promote tumor cell invasion in cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells.A. The mRNA levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. B. The protein expression levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by ELISA in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C-F. Transwell migration assays were used to determine the functional significance of cytokines secreted by CAFs on tumor invasion. Assays were conducted by using either immunoneutralizing antibody (C and E) or addition of ligands (D and F) in the co-culture system. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u200a=\u200a3 separate experiments (**P<0.01), (magnification 100\u00d7).DiscussionCancer-associated fibroblasts have been recognized for their impact on the carcinogenesis, promotion and progression of many carcinomas. Breast cancer is notoriously associated with tumor microenvironment stroma with activated fibroblasts. However, relatively little is known about the relationship of biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs in the stroma of human breast carcinoma. Herein, this study focused on the gene expression profile of human breast cancer-derived fibroblasts in order to reveal the molecular mechanism of how fibroblasts induce a favorable microenvironment to cancer development.CAFs had several pivotal biological characteristics compared with NFs in human breast cancer. Using the CAFs and its paired NFs isolated from breast cancer tissue, the proliferation, migration and invasion of CAFs themselves were memorably higher than that of NFs in breast cancer. And CAFs had the potential capacity for the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Furthermore, the invasion ability of CAFs and breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 could significantly be increased under the co-culture system of tumor cells and CAFs or NFs cells.In line with the finding of the biological difference between CAFs and NFs, the heterogeneity of genes expression profiles and signal pathways were highly consistent with the biological characteristics of CAFs and NFs. The huge heterogeneity of gene expression was found between CAFs and NFs (Table S1 and S2). For example, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and cancer susceptibility candidate 5 (CASC5) took part in the regulating proliferation of CAF itself and tumor cell.Compared with NFs, over-expressed genes in CAFs afford several interesting insights into the dynamics of the carcinoma microenvironment through the special GO Catalogue. The gene ontology and signaling pathway analysis showed that the cell cycle and cell cycle regulated signaling pathways in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times respectively, compared with NFs. Traditionally, p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were cancer suppressor gene, but p53 signaling pathway abnormal activated and over-expressed of BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATR in CAFs may involve in other function in the tumor microenvironment. Similarly, ATM signaling pathway and cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathway may be related to cell proliferation in response to oxidative stress, although they were in responds to DNA damage or DNA strand break in traditionally. These data demonstrated that the vigorous proliferation of CAFs than NFs by some special activated signal pathway. However, the details will be further study for our next work.Moreover, the different invasion capacity between CAFs and NFs may be supported by other sets of genes expression (e.g. FOXM1, MMP9, PTTG1, IGHG1, TM4SF19, S100A9, SDCBP) in the CAFs and NFs. Heterogeneity of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1) were involved in cancer invasion and migration. In breast cancer, the securin protein stability of PTTG1 was correlated with securin accumulation. Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (IGHG1) and transmembrane 4 L six family member 19 (TM4SF19) were related to tumor immune invasion mechanisms and then made the tumor cells immunity. S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9) has been revealed as the metastasis-inducing protein. Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP) was reported involving in cancer metastatic progression. These results support the function of fibroblasts in breast carcinoma to promote cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis.Furthermore, CAFs recruited numerous cells related with tumor angiogenesis, infiltration, which promoted the tumor invasion and metastasis, through secreted some special chemical chemotactic factors. For example, CXCL14 derived from CAFs in prostate cancer and SDF1/CXCL12 derived from CAFs in breast cancer called up macrophages, endothelial cells derived from bone marrow source, M2 mononuclear cells to the tumor tissue respectively, which assisted the tumor formation new blood and lymph vessels. Chemokine signaling pathway and PI3k signaling pathways enriched in CAFs also illustrated that CAFs could promote itself and the cancer cell invasion and migration. These studies suggest that a close and frequent crosstalk between the CAFs and tumor cells exists during tumor invasion and metastasis process.In addition, a set of signaling associated with immune response, activation or immune escape were found in this study. For example, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules are abnormality compared with NFs. Although, its roles in the microenvironment to promote tumorigenesis and/or development for breast carcinoma are keeping study, these finding in current work indicate that CAFs may involve in immune response and/or immune escape of tumor cell.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer associated fibroblasts: the dark side of the coinBreast cancer stem cells, cytokine networks, and the tumor microenvironmentBreast cancer\u2013one term, many entities?Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts promotes the proliferation of a lingual carcinoma cell line by secreting keratinocyte growth factorCancer-associated orthotopic myofibroblasts stimulates the motility of gastric carcinoma cellsRole of cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts in metastatic colon cancer to the liver and their expression profilesCasbas-Hernandez P, Fleming JM, Troester MA (2011) Gene Expression Analysis of In Vitro Cocultures to Study Interactions between Breast Epithelium and Stroma.

        "title": "TGF-beta receptor type-2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts regulates breast cancer cell growth and survival and is a prognostic marker in pre-menopausal breast cancer.",
        "content": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a pleiotropic cytokine with the capability to act as tumour suppressor or tumour promoter depending on the cellular context. TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFBR2) is the ligand-binding receptor for all members of the TGF-\u03b2 family. Data from mouse model experiments demonstrated that loss of Tgfbr2 expression in mammary fibroblasts was linked to tumour initiation and metastasis. Using a randomised tamoxifen trial cohort including in total 564 invasive breast carcinomas, we examined TGFBR2 expression (n=252) and phosphorylation level of downstream target SMAD2 (pSMAD2) (n=319) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and assessed links to clinicopathological markers, prognostic and treatment-predictive values. The study revealed that CAF-specific TGFBR2 expression correlated with improved recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed CAF-TGFBR2 to be an independent prognostic marker (multivariate Cox regression, hazard ratio: 0.534, 95% (CI): 0.360-0.793, P=0.002). CAF-specific pSMAD2 levels, however, did not associate with survival outcome. Experimentally, TGF-\u03b2 signalling in fibroblasts was modulated using a TGF-\u03b2 ligand and inhibitor or through lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated TGFBR2-specific knockdown. To determine the role of fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway on breast cancer cells, we used cell contact-dependent cell growth and clonogenicity assays, which showed that knockdown of TGFBR2 in CAFs resulted in increased cell growth, proliferation and clonogenic survival. Further, in a mouse model transfected CAFs were co-injected with MCF7 and tumour weight and proportion was monitored. We found that mouse xenograft tumours comprising TGFBR2 knockdown fibroblasts were slightly bigger and displayed increased tumour cell capacity. Overall, our data demonstrate that fibroblast-related biomarkers possess clinically relevant information and that fibroblasts confer effects on breast cancer cell growth and survival. Regulation of tumour-stromal cross-talk through fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway may depend on fibroblast phenotype, emphasising the importance to characterise tumour microenvironment subtypes. ",

        "content": "It has been shown that, in breast stroma, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) mRNA is predominantly expressed by myofibroblasts located at the invasive areas of the tumor. To examine which factors present in a tumor environment are candidates responsible for the induction of these uPA-producing myofibroblasts, we studied in vitro the capacity of a paired panel of normal and tumor-derived human breast fibroblasts to produce uPA protein and the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA) in response to various cytokines implicated in the process of tissue-remodeling during malignant transformation. We found that fibroblasts produced increased amounts of uPA protein after exposure to a-FGF, b-FGF, EGF, PDGF-BB, and IFN-gamma, were unaffected in this respect by IL-6, M-CSF, GM-CSF and Oncostatin M, and produced decreased amounts of uPA protein after exposure to IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha, IGF-I, and IGF-II. None of these cytokines were able to induce a striking increase in the fraction of alpha-SMA-positive fibroblasts. On the other hand, 25 pM TGFbeta1 increased the fraction of alpha-SMA-positive fibroblasts 5-fold in both normal and tumor-tissue-derived fibroblasts. Nonetheless, the normal-derived fibroblasts were unaffected in their uPA-producing capacity by TGFbeta1, and the tumor-derived fibroblasts produced decreased amounts of uPA protein after exposure to this cytokine, implying that at least in vitro the myofibroblast phenotype is not a prerequisite for the production of uPA by human breast fibroblasts. In addition, we established that the basal-uPA-production of both normal and tumor-derived fibroblasts was increased by autocrinely produced b-FGF-like activity, and that the basal-uPA-production of at least the normal-derived fibroblasts was decreased by autocrinely produced IGF-like activity. Altogether, our data suggest an active role for fibroblasts in the process of uPA-directed breast tumor proteolysis.",

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

Using MDA-MB-231 cell derived mammary tumors in SCID mice we show here for the first time in vivo that invasion in a human mammary tumor model is dependent on both paracrine signaling with host macrophages as well as autocrine signaling involving the tumor cells themselves. In particular we show that, the autocrine contribution to invasion is specifically amplified in vivo through a tumor microenvironment induced upregulation of CSF-1R expression via the transforming growth factor-\u03b21.IntroductionMetastasis is a multi-step process that requires increased motility of the tumor cells inside the primary tumor and invasion of surrounding tissues and blood vessels. The tumor microenvironment has an essential role in promoting these steps of motility and invasion in tumor cells, through either secretion of chemotactic factors or direct interactions with stromal cells. In rat and mouse mammary tumors, tumor- associated macrophages are essential for promoting angiogenesis, matrix remodeling and chemotactic motility of the tumor cells. In particular, a paracrine interaction between macrophages and tumor cells, that involves epidermal growth factor (EGF) and colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), is the driving force for relay chemotaxis supporting macrophage-mediated invasion in both transgenic mouse and rat mammary tumors. During relay chemotaxis, tumor cells secrete CSF-1 and sense EGF, while the macrophages secrete EGF and sense CSF-1. This phenomenon has been studied extensively both by intravital imaging in living animals as well as by reconstituting the interaction of the two cell types in vitro. Additional studies support the importance of macrophages in invasion and metastasis of the tumor cells. Absence of CSF-1 in the mammary cancer-susceptible PyMT mice retarded tumor progression and metastasis but did not affect primary tumor development, directly implicating macrophages and CSF-1 as important regulators of invasion and metastasis. In later work with xenogeneic tumors in mice, blockade of CSF-1 through antisense oligonucleotides or neutralizing anti-CSF-1 antibodies also reduced primary tumor growth and angiogenesis and prolonged long-term survival.In humans, patient sample data has suggested that CSF-1 and its receptor might play critical roles during progression of tumors of the female reproductive system and other solid tumors. Expression of the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) has been associated with adverse clinicopathological prognostic outcome in ovarian, endometrial and breast carcinomas. Expression of CSF-1R has also been detected in prostate cancer cells in tumors with elevated Gleason scores. Interestingly, CSF-1 is also expressed in ovarian and endometrial tumors and cell lines and in breast cancer and CSF-1 and the CSF-1R are co-expressed in greater than 50% of mammary tumors. In addition, increased circulating CSF-1 levels are a prognostic marker for epithelial ovarian cancer and are elevated in a large proportion of endometrial cancers. Elevated circulating CSF-1 was also suggested to be an indicator of early metastatic relapse in breast cancer patients. These observations have led to the hypothesis that there may be an autocrine loop involving tumor cells expressing both CSF-1 and CSF-1R, which contributes to invasion and metastasis in human tumors. Several in vitro studies now support this hypothesis. Human lung cell lines and breast cell lines that express CSF-1R, but not the ligand, show increased invasion in vitro into an amniotic basement membrane upon stimulation with CSF-1. Similarly, when the normal non-invasive mouse mammary cell line HC11, that expresses CSF-1 but not the receptor, is forced to overexpress CSF-1R, it shows rapid growth and colony formation in soft agar, increased invasion through matrigel, and a higher incidence of lung tumors after tail vein injections into BALB/c mice, compared to the parental line. Additionally, when CSF-1 and its receptor are both stably overexpressed in the MCF10A human mammary cell line, the cells exhibit abnormal acinar morphogenesis and increased motility in an in vitro wound-healing assay.These latter in vitro studies were performed with cells in which CSF-1 or its receptor, or both, were overexpressed, in order to mimic hypothesized autocrine signaling and they did not assess the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to the onset of autocrine signaling. Indeed, there have been no direct in vivo studies to determine whether a CSF-1 autocrine signaling loop is induced in the microenvironment of the primary tumor and if it contributes to invasion in human breast cancer. Moreover, the contribution of autocrine CSF-1 signaling to invasion cannot be investigated in the popular transgenic mouse models, because neither the mouse epithelial cells nor the mouse tumor cells express the CSF-1R. Epithelial expression of the CSF-1R transcript in human mammary epithelium is hormonally regulated via a glucocorticoid response element that is absent from the murine locus. Therefore, additional models and studies are needed to test the hypothesis that CSF-1/CSF-1R autocrine signaling contributes to invasion of human breast cancer cells in vivo.Based on the rodent models and the patient data described above, the CSF-1R could be involved in human breast tumor invasion in at least two ways. The rodent studies point to macrophage-assisted invasion involving an EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop and the patient studies suggest that tumor cell invasion is regulated in an autocrine manner by CSF-1, provided the tumor cells express both CSF-1 and CSF-1R. In this study, we directly address these two possibilities in vivo.We used the human breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 as a model for our analysis, because its triple-negative status (estrogen/progesterone receptor negative, HER2 negative) categorizes it in the basal-like subtype of breast cancers. These are generally the most aggressive and highly metastatic breast tumors. As we show that MDA-MB-231 cells express both CSF-1 and the CSF-1R, this cell line, without further manipulation, is an appropriate one in which to study the role of autocrine signaling in aggressive breast tumors.Materials and MethodsCell cultureMDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A stable GFP-expressing line was made by transfecting the MDA-MB-231 cells with the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using the Amaxa nucleofector (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD), selecting in 500 \u03bcg/ml G418 for 2 weeks and sorting for the GFP-positive cells. Mouse BAC1.2F5 macrophages were cultured in \u03b1-MEM with 10% FBS and 36 ng/mL of Human recombinant CSF-1 (a gift from Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA).Animal ModelsAll procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health regulations, and approved by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine animal usecommittee. A total of 2\u00d7106 MDA-MB-231-GFP cells per animal were resuspended in sterile PBS with 20% collagen I (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and injected into the lower left mammary fat pad of severe combined immunodeficiency mice (SCID) (NCI, Frederick, MD). All experiments were performed on tumors that were 1.2 \u2013 1.5 cm in diameter. SB431542 (Tocris), where indicated, was injected intraperitoneally in the xenografts at 100mg/kg 3 hours prior to experiments. FVB/NJ mice transgenic for the Polyoma Middle T oncogene (PyMT) under the MMTV-LTR, generated as previously described in, were used for in vivo invasion assays at 12\u201314 weeks of age.In vivo invasion assayCell collection into needles placed into live anesthetized animals was carried out as described previously. Cells can only enter the needles by active migration since a block is used to prevent passive collection of cells and tissue during insertion of the needle into the tissue. Cell migration has been demonstrated to be required for cell collection. After 4 hours, the needles were removed and the total number of cells collected was determined by 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. The chemoattractants used include mouse EGF (Invitrogen), human recombinant EGF (Invitrogen) and human recombinant CSF-1 (Chiron Corp.), at final concentration 25nM. To inhibit EGFR, Iressa (AstraZeneca), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor specific for EGFR, was used in the needles in final concentration 5 \u03bcM, as described previously. To inhibit CSF-1R, a monoclonal rat anti-mouse antibody (AFS98,) or a monoclonal mouse anti-human antibody (MAB3291, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were used in the needles at a final concentration of 125 \u03bcg/ml. Controls were same quantities of DMSO (Sigma), rat IgG (BD Biosciences) or mouse IgG same isotype antibodies (R&D Systems).Determination of Cell Types CollectedTyping of the collected cells was done as described previously, using cell type-specific antibodies rabbit anti-pancytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) for carcinoma cells and rat anti-F4/80 for macrophages. DAPI was used for counting total cells.Collagen invasion assayThe assay was performed as described in. Briefly, MDA-MB-231-GFP cells were plated in the presenceor absence of BAC1.2F5 macrophages. The next day they were overlaidwith collagenI (BD) and incubated for 24 hours after which the assay was fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Where indicated,cells were pretreated with Iressa (1 \u03bcM final), or the CSF-1R blocking antibodies described above (final 10\u201325 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 hours. The fixed assay was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Invasion of the tumor cells was quantified as the proportion of fluorescence more than 20 \u03bcm into the collagen.RNA extraction and PCR amplificationFor the in vitro stimulations, the cells were starved overnight in DMEM/0.35% BSA, prior to addition of cytokines for 1, 4, 7, 24 and 75 hours. The results shown are for the 4 hour stimulation, when the effect of TGF\u03b21 was maximal (EGF and CSF-1 were identical for all timepoints). RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 1 \u03bcg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). 2\u20135 ng of total cDNA was used per real-time PCR reaction or standard PCR (30 cycles) with specific primers (see Supplementary Table for primer sequences). Electrophoresis of the PCR productswas performed on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromidestaining.For the comparison of the average primary tumor cells (APTC) with the cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, amplified total cDNA was used as input in the real-time PCR. The detailed protocol and validation of the technique has been published elsewhere. Briefly, for the APTC sample, tumors from MDA-MB-231-GFP xenograft animals were excised, mechanically dissociated into single cell suspensions on ice, sorted for the GFP-positive cells and lysed with the RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). Total RNA from APTC and from cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells was converted to cDNA and amplified with the SMART amplification kit (Clontech). The final amplified cDNA was purified with Qiagen MinElute columns and 2 ng was used in the real-time PCR per reaction.Real-time PCR confirmationQuantitative PCR analysis was performed as described previously, using the Power SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents system (Applied Biosystems). Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate, and the mean threshold cycle (CT) values were used for analysis. All the genes tested were compared with two housekeeping genes (\u03b2-2 microglobulin and GAPDH) for the analysis. Resultswere evaluated with the ABI Prism SDS 2.1 software.Western BlotFor the western blot analysis whole cell lysates were prepared by washing the cells with cold PBS, followed by direct addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and sonication and boiling of the lysate. Western blots were carried out as follows: the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in odyssey blocking solution (LiCor), incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C (MAB3291 anti-human CSF-1R antibody and anti-\u03b2-actin antibody AC15 from Sigma-Aldrich for control), secondary antibodies for 1 hour at RT (Mouse 680 and Rabbit 800 from Licor and chicken 800 from Rockland), and finally analyzed using the Odyssey (LiCor). Visualization and processing of images was performed with ImageJ (NIH).Statistical AnalysisResults shown are representative of at least 3 experiments with duplicate plates of cells for the in vitro experiments and at least 5 different mice per point for the in vivo experiments. All statistical analyses were assessed using a two-tailed Student\u2019s t test.ResultsHuman breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells express the CSF-1 receptor and its ligandIn previous studies we have characterized a paracrine interaction between breast carcinoma cells and macrophages involving EGF and CSF-1, using both xenograft (MTLn3 rat breast tumor cells) and transgenic (MMTV-PyMT) mouse mammary tumors. In an effort to test whether similar interactions exist in a human breast cancer cell - derived mammary tumor we tested the expression of these growth factors and their ligands in the human breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1A). Similar to the rodent breast carcinoma cells, the MDA-MB-231 cells express the mRNA for the EGF receptor (EGFR) but not for EGF. The MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells, like their rodent counterparts, also express mRNA for CSF-1, raising the possibility of an EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop akin to the paracrine loop we have observed with rodent tumors, in which EGF is produced by tumor-associated macrophages (Fig. 1A). Based on this gene expression pattern, we used a 3D in vitro invasion assay where the tumor cells, either alone or in the presence of macrophages, are monitored for their invasive ability through a 3D collagen matrix. The invasion of the MDA-MB-231 cells was enhanced in the presence of macrophages (Fig. 1C, and also in), demonstrating that the EGF/CSF-1 paracrine interaction with the macrophages exists for the human breast tumor cell-derived mammary tumors as seen in rat and mouse mammary tumors.However, as described above, patient data have also shown concomitant expression of CSF-1 and its receptor in tumor cells of aggressive breast cancers and unlike their rodent counterparts, the human MDA-MB-231 cells also express the CSF-1R as well as the mRNA for CSF-1 (Fig. 1A and 1B). Thus, the MDA-MB-231 cell line is a good model to test the potential of a CSF-1/CSF-1R autocrine contribution to invasion and metastasis in human breast cancer, without forced and artificial overexpression of either molecule.Macrophages are involved less in invasion in the human MDA-MB-231 tumors than in mouse and rat tumorsTo investigate the relative contributions of autocrine and paracrine signaling to invasion and intravasation in vivo, we made mammary tumors using MDA-MB-231 cells in mice and we used the in vivo invasion assay to measure the invasive potential of these cells. In this assay, as described in detail in the materials and methods, microneedles containing matrigel and a chemoattractant are inserted into the primary tumors while the animal is alive and under anesthesia. This assay mimics natural blood vessels inside the primary tumor where EGF secreted by macrophages attracts the invasive tumor cells to these blood vessels, a movement that eventually will lead to intravasation and hematogenous metastasis. Using this assay in the MDA-MB-231 xenografts, we collected the invasive cells that responded to EGF (Fig. 2A), extruded them out of the needles and identified the cell types with cell type-specific antibodies. As expected from previous studies with rat MTLn3 xenografts and the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse models, the invasive subpopulation in MDA-MB-231 tumors was comprised of macrophages and tumor cells (Fig. 2B). However, the proportion of macrophages was less than observed with rodent tumors (approximately 6% versus 25% respectively, Figs. 2B and 2C), implying that MDA-MB-231 cell-derived mammary tumors are less dependent on macrophages for invasion and hematogenous dissemination. The possibility that the interaction between tumor cells and macrophages is hindered in this xenograft model due to species difference is unlikely; MDA-MB-231 cells respond to mouse EGF as well as to human EGF both in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 1) and mouse macrophages respond similarly to both mouse and human CSF-1.Both autocrine and paracrine stimulation of the CSF-1 receptor mediate invasion in the MDA-MB-231 mammary tumorsTo further investigate the relative contributions of paracrine and autocrine signaling in vivo, we performed a series of experiments in the MDA-MB-231 derived primary mammary tumor using the in vivo invasion assay. First, we evaluated the contribution of the EGFR to the invasion in primary MDA-MB-231 tumors (Fig. 3A). There was a decrease in the number of invasive cells collected in response to EGF in the presence of the EGFR inhibitor, Iressa (Fig. 3B). A similar inhibition by Iressa was observed when the cells were collected in response to CSF-1, suggesting a CSF-1/EGF paracrine loop between the human tumor cells and the macrophages in vivo. Interestingly, for either EGF- or CSF-1- driven invasion, the inhibition by Iressa was incomplete (Fig. 3B). In contrast, in an identical previous experiment in a rodent mammary tumor, where there was complete inhibition by Iressa, consistent with a more significant involvement of macrophage-supplied EGF in the mouse tumors.We next examined the contribution of the CSF-1R to the paracrine and autocrine interactions in these human cell line-derived mammary tumors. To investigate the role of this receptor in tumor cells versus macrophages, we used an antibody that specifically blocks the mouse CSF-1R ( and supplemental Fig. 2A) to block the paracrine interaction between the macrophages and the tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, to block only autocrine signaling in the human tumor cells (Fig. 3A), we used an antibody that specifically blocks the human (but not the mouse) CSF-1R (supplemental Fig. 2A). In the MDA-MB-231 mammary tumors, blocking either the human or the mouse CSF-1R only partially decreased the number of total cells collected in response to EGF (Fig. 3C). However, a combination of both antibodies completely inhibited invasion to background levels (Fig. 3C, matrigel alone control bar). This is not an effect of doubling the total amount of antibody, as using twice the amount of each antibody alone did not produce this synergistic result (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Therefore, in MDA-MB-231 mammary tumors, a mix of paracrine signaling between tumor cells and macrophages and autocrine signaling in the tumor cells is involved in invasion in vivo.The autocrine contribution to invasion via the CSF-1R on MDA-MB-231 tumor cells is promoted specifically by TGF\u03b2 in the tumor microenvironmentWe used the 3D in vitro invasion assay, where MDA-MB-231 cells alone or in co-culture with macrophages are monitored for their invasion ability through a collagen matrix (Fig. 4A), with the specific inhibitors and the blocking antibodies described above, to investigate autocrine and paracrine contributions of EGFR and CSF-1R to in vitro invasion. In co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells and macrophages, pre-treatment with the EGFR specific inhibitor, Iressa dramatically decreased the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to invade (Fig. 4B). Additionally, incubation with the blocking antibody to the mouse (macrophage) CSF-1R substantially reduced invasion through the collagen matrix as well, almost to the background level of the MDA-MB-231 cells alone (Fig. 4C), while it had no effect on the migration of the tumor cells when alone in the collagen matrix (Supplemental Fig. 3). The requirement for the tumor cells\u2019 EGFR function (Fig. 4B) together with the requirement for the mouse macrophage CSF-1R function (Fig. 4C), further supports the CSF-1/EGF paracrine interaction between the tumor cells and macrophages. However, incubation with the blocking antibody to the human tumor cell CSF-1R had no effect on the in vitro invasion of the tumor cells in the presence or absence of macrophages; i.e., invasion by the tumor cells was similar in the presence of the blocking or control antibodies (Fig. 4C and Supplemental Fig. 3). This result was unexpected, given that this same antibody inhibited invasion in vivo (Fig. 3C) and it suggests that autocrine CSF-1R signaling contributes more to invasion in vivo in the primary tumors than in vitro.In Fig. 1A, we examined the gene expression pattern shown for the MDA-MB-231 cells, in cell culture. In order to test for gene expression changes that could account for the difference in behavior of these cells in vitro and in vivo, we also isolated RNA from the average primary tumor cells after their growth in the microenvironment of the primary tumor. Interestingly, when comparing the average primary tumor cells to the cultured MDA-MB-231, we found that the mRNA expression of CSF-1R in the MDA-MB-231 cells from tumors was 2.5 to 5-fold upregulated compared to the same cells in culture (Fig. 5A). We also tested expression of the mRNAs for EGFR, CSF-1 and TGF\u03b1, but none showed such striking upregulation as did the CSF-1R mRNA (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that the CSF-1R mRNA upregulation is a phenotype specific to the growth of tumor cells in vivo in the primary tumor and not a direct result of the stimulation by the growth factors involved in the paracrine/autocrine loops tested in this study. In fact, stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cells with either EGF or CSF-1 was not sufficient to produce the CSF-1R mRNA upregulation seen in the invasive tumor cells isolated from the primary tumor (Fig. 5B and 5C).To explore the microenvironmental signal that causes the upregulation of CSF-1R expression in tumor cells in vivo, we investigated the involvement of TGF\u03b21. Induction of the CSF-1R mRNA by TGF\u03b21 has been reported in vascular smooth muscle cells and in cervical cancer cells lines. MDA-MB-231 cells express the receptors for TGF\u03b21 and thus could be responsive to it. Considering the established role of TGF\u03b2 signaling in tumor progression in breast cancer, we hypothesized that TGF\u03b21 is the microenvironmental signal that prompts the upregulation of CSF-1R in human breast tumor cells. Indeed, when we stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro with TGF\u03b21, we found a 2.5\u20133 -fold upregulation of their CSF-1R mRNA expression. To address the role of TGF\u03b21 in the upregulation of CSF-1R in vivo, we treated MDA-MB-231 xenografts with SB431542, a specific inhibitor to the TGF\u03b2 receptor (TBRI). Treatment with this inhibitor significantly decreased the CSF-1R mRNA expression of the primary tumor cells (Fig. 6B). Additionally, invasion in the treated animals in vivo was significantly reduced compared to the animals injected with DMSO vehicle control (Fig. 6C), and similar to numbers observed when the human CSF-1R blocking antibody was used in the in vivo invasion assay (Fig. 3C). Our results suggest that TGF\u03b21 is the signal inside the primary tumor that promotes the in vivo autocrine CSF-1R mediated invasion of the human breast tumor cells.DiscussionIncreased tumor expression of CSF-1 and its receptor has been observed in several types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. The correlation of expression of both the receptor and its ligand with cancer aggressiveness led to the hypothesis of autocrine signaling through CSF-1R in these tumors. In addition to this potential autocrine role, the elevated expression of CSF-1 by some tumors suggested that CSF-1 might contribute to increased infiltration of macrophages into the primary tumor and their interaction with the tumor cells, a phenomenon also linked to tumor aggressiveness. We have used the highly metastatic human breast tumor line MDA-MB-231 to address the mechanism of contribution of CSF-1R in invasion by breast cancer cells. Here we show that invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro is paracrine requiring the presence of macrophages for optimum invasion. However, using MDA-MB-231 derived mammary tumors,, we show that invasion in these human cell line-derived tumors in vivo involves both autocrine CSF-1R signaling, as well as macrophage-associated signaling through the EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop. Interestingly, the autocrine contribution in human breast tumor cell invasion is greatly enhanced in vivo and this is associated with a transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21)-mediated increased expression of the CSF-1R mRNA by the carcinoma cells in the microenvironment of the primary tumor.As described in the introduction, transgenic mouse models have failed to address the autocrine role of the CSF-1R in mammary tumor cells, because of the lack of CSF-1R expression in murine mammary epithelia. Notably, in a study by Kirma et al., two transgenic mouse models were prepared where MMTV promoter-driven transgenic mice were forced to overexpress either human CSF-1 or the mouse CSF-1R in the mammary epithelium. Both mouse models exhibited an increased rate of glandular dysplasia and ductal hyperplasia and an increased tissue macrophage infiltration. This model further illustrated the importance of CSF-1 and the CSF-1R in cancer progression, but did not evaluate the effects of autocrine regulation through their co-expression in the same tumor cells. In another study, Sapi et al. used tail vein injection in mice of CSF-1R overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to address a potential role of autocrine CSF-1R signaling in metastasis in vivo. The mice that received the CSF-1R overexpressing cells showed increased lung metastasis compared to those receiving the parental cells not expressing the CSF-1R. However, this experimental metastasis system does not address the invasiveness of tumor cells in the primary tumor. In our study, we show a direct role for autocrine CSF-1R signaling in invasion in primary mammary tumors, resulting from spontaneous expression of CSF-1/CSF-1R in human breast cancer cells. Considering that invasion is an early step in the metastatic cascade, our results indicate that both autocrine and paracrine CSF-1 loops significantly contribute to dissemination of cancer cells and progression in human breast cancer. In addition, it is possible that different microenvironments of the same tumor have different contributions to paracrine and autocrine invasion depending on local TGF\u03b2 levels and local macrophage densities. The important clinical implication of our findings is that since the mammary tumor microenvironment is inducing the elevated expression of CSF-1R, blocking CSF-1 or its receptor in patients would not only suppress macrophage infiltration in breast tumors and the EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop, but also the CSF-1/CSF-1R autocrine-mediated invasion by carcinoma cells.While MDA-MB-231 cells do not express significant amounts of EGF mRNA, they do express the mRNA for TGF\u03b1, another EGFR ligand (Fig. 1A). However, invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells does not appear to be regulated in an autocrine fashion by TGF\u03b1. In particular, the EGFR inhibitor, Iressa, did not affect the ability of the cells to move by themselves in the in vitro invasion assay (data not shown), but decreased their invasive ability when they were in the presence of macrophages, due to the effect on the paracrine loop (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, simultaneously blocking both the tumor cell and macrophage CSF-1 receptors brings in vivo invasion to background levels (Fig. 3C), showing that there is no additional contribution from autocrine activation of the EGF receptor.Interestingly, the human MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells are more autocrine for CSF-1 in vivo than in vitro, a finding explained by the upregulation of the CSF-1R mRNA in tumor cells within the microenvironment of the primary tumor. We also show that TGF\u03b21 signaling is likely the microenvironmental signal that causes this in vivo CSF-1R upregulation in the human tumor cells. Tumors are regularly infiltrated by leukocytes, macrophages, myeloid precursors and other cells, which are the source of TGF\u03b2 secretion and accumulation in primary tumors. TGF\u03b2 is associated with tumor progression, through several mechanisms such as induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, myofibroblast generation, inhibition of host immunosurveillance and others. Our study suggests an additional role for TGF\u03b2 signaling in invasion and metastasis of human breast cancer cells, through an upregulation of the CSF-1R and induction of the CSF-1/CSF-1R autocrine loop in human primary tumor cells.Supplementary MaterialFiguresExpression of chemotactic factors and their receptors by the human breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231A. mRNA expression was analyzed by PCR of total cDNA made from MDA-MB-231 cells in culture.

        "content": "Unlike heterogeneous tumor cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are genetically more stable which serve as a reliable target for tumor immunotherapy. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) which is restrictively expressed in tumor cells and CAF in vivo and plays a prominent role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis can function as a tumor rejection antigen. In the current study, we have constructed artificial FAP(+) stromal cells which mimicked the FAP(+) CAF in vivo. We immunized a breast cancer mouse model with FAP(+) stromal cells to perform immunotherapy against FAP(+) cells in the tumor microenvironment. By forced expression of FAP, we have obtained FAP(+) stromal cells whose phenotype was CD11b(+)/CD34(+)/Sca-1(+)/FSP-1(+)/MHC class I(+). Interestingly, proliferation capacity of the fibroblasts was significantly enhanced by FAP. In the breast cancer-bearing mouse model, vaccination with FAP(+) stromal cells has significantly inhibited the growth of allograft tumor and reduced lung metastasis indeed. Depletion of T cell assays has suggested that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were involved in the tumor cytotoxic immune response. Furthermore, tumor tissue from FAP-immunized mice revealed that targeting FAP(+) CAF has induced apoptosis and decreased collagen type I and CD31 expression in the tumor microenvironment. These results implicated that immunization with FAP(+) stromal cells led to the disruption of the tumor microenvironment. Our study may provide a novel strategy for immunotherapy of a broad range of cancer. ",

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

        "content": "Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to promote tumor growth and progression. Our objective was to measure the effect of TGF-beta1 on fibroblasts isolated from invasive breast cancer patients. Fibroblasts were isolated from tissue obtained at surgery from patients with invasive breast cancer (CAF; n = 28) or normal reduction mammoplasty patients (normal; n = 10). Myofibroblast activation was measured by counting cells immunostained for smooth muscle alpha actin (ACTA2) in cultures +/- TGF-beta 1. Conditioned media (CM) was collected for invasion assays and RNA was isolated from cultures incubated in media +/- TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Q-PCR was used to measure expression of cyclin D1, fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, urokinase, stromelysin-1, and ACTA2 genes. Invasion rate was measured in chambers plated with MDA-MB-231 cells and exposed to CM in the bottom chamber; the number of cells that invaded into the bottom chamber was counted. Wilcox Rank Sum tests were used to evaluate differences in CAFs and normal fibroblasts and the effect of TGF-beta 1. There was no difference in percent myofibroblasts or invasion rate between normal and CAF cultures. However, TGF-beta1 significantly increased the percent of myofibroblasts (P &lt; 0.01) and invasion rate (P = 0.02) in CAF cultures. Stromelysin-1 expression was significantly higher in normal versus CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). TGF-beta 1 significantly increased ACTA2 expression in both normal and CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). Expression of fibronectin and laminin was significantly increased by TGF-beta in CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). CAFs were measurably different from normal fibroblasts in response to TGF-beta 1, suggesting that TGF-beta stimulates changes in CAFs that foster tumor invasion.",

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay. Shown are representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (no treatment [NT]) after 24 h. (B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0028. (C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

Bars indicate size expressed in micrometers (pt. #2 and #3) or pixels (pt. #1). Magnification, 5\u00d7. (D) Histogram of mean absorbance of crystal violet eluted from NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

(B) Histograms of qRT-PCR results showing the expression levels of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with exosomes compared with NT. Data are shown as relative expression of the miRNAs. Standard deviations were calculated on technical duplicates. The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008). (C) Histograms of qRT-PCR results showing the basal expression levels of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 in NFs compared with CAFs. Data are shown as relative expression of miRNAs folded on NFs. Standard deviations were calculated with replicates from two independent experiments performed on four different primary NF cells (pt. #1, #2, #3, and #4) and four different primary CAF cells (pt. #81, #82, #87, and #89). The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027). (D) Representative images of the EXOmotif analysis with MDS software showing a short motif (3\u20135 nt) in miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 sequences, predictive of their active loading into exosomes.

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on two different NF cells (pt. #2 and #3).

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0049. (E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "title": "Expression of the alpha-fetoprotein gene in human breast cancer.",
        "content": "Recently, evidence was obtained that the ability to take up alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP), which is characteristic of fetal cells, may be required both in vivo and in vitro by different types of human and animal tumor cells via expression of specific alpha-FP receptors. Mammary gland carcinomas belong to this class of tumor. In some neoplasms, expression of alpha-FP receptors is concomitant with activation of the alpha-FP gene and synthesis of the protein, suggesting that an autocrine alpha-FP/alpha-FP-receptor pathway is operational in these tumors. In the present work, 18 human breast cancer biopsy specimens were subjected to in situ hybridization with a human alpha-FP cDNA probe. Positive labeling for alpha-FP mRNA transcripts was seen in 8 of the specimens. Surprisingly, strong positive signals were seen in stromal fibroblasts and lymphocytes infiltrating tumor nests and in adipocytes adjacent to tumor areas, while the malignant cells themselves were hardly labeled. This suggest paracrine stimulation of the alpha-FP gene, probably as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Pathological implications arise from the ability of alpha-FP to regulate growth, either alone or synergistically with other growth factors, as well as its ability to enhance fatty acid entry into proliferating cells.",

        "full_text": "Virus Elimination by Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents Impacts Glucose Homeostasis in Chronic Hepatitis C PatientsBackground and AimsChronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with dysregulation of glucose homeostasis, including insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. However, independent risk factors associated with IR in chronic HCV-infected patients have not been detailly elucidated. Previous data regarding the impact of HCV elimination by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) on glucose homeostasis is insufficient and controversial. This study aimed to analyze the independent factors associated with IR and to evaluate the changes in glucose homeostasis in chronic HCV-infected patients treated with DAAs therapies.MethodsWe screened 704 patients with chronic HCV infection who underwent treatment with interferon-free DAAs. Patients\u2019 baseline characteristics, biochemical and virological data were collected. The outcome measurements were their IR and \u03b2-cell function assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment.ResultsHigh IR (HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5) was observed in 35.1% of the patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2, treatment experience, elevated baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and triglyceride, as well as Fibrosis-4 score >3.25 were independently associated with high IR. In patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR), no significant change in mean HOMA-IR was observed from baseline to 12-weeks post-treatment (2.74 \u00b1 2.78 to 2.54 \u00b1 2.20, p\u00a0= 0.128). We observed a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell secretion stress from 121.0 \u00b1 110.1 to 107.6 \u00b1 93.0 (p = 0.015). Subgroup analysis revealed that SVR was associated with a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5 (5.31 \u00b1 3.39 to 3.68 \u00b1 2.57, p < 0.001), HCV genotype 1 (3.05 \u00b1 3.11 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.05, p = 0.027), and treatment experience (4.00 \u00b1 3.37 to 3.01 \u00b1 2.49, p = 0.039).ConclusionsThere were several independent factors associated with IR in patients with chronic HCV infection, including obesity, treatment experience, high serum ALT and triglyceride levels, as well as advanced hepatic fibrosis. After viral elimination by DAAs, we observed a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with baseline high IR, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience.IntroductionChronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also associated with multiple extrahepatic complications that influence the clinical outcomes of patients. An important extrahepatic manifestation is abnormal glucose metabolism including insulin resistance (IR), \u03b2-cell dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus (DM). A prospective study showed that patients with chronic HCV infection were more than 11 times as likely as those without HCV infection to develop diabetes. A meta-analysis revealed a 1.8-fold higher risk of type 2 DM in HCV-infected patients than in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive/HCV-negative patients. Additionally, glucose abnormalities can worsen hepatic outcomes in HCV-infected patients. IR promotes the progression of hepatic fibrosis. This may be due to the direct effect of insulin on the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells and secretion of extracellular matrix. Further, high glucose levels and hyperinsulinemia can lead to upregulation of connective growth factor that is involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. In HCV-related chronic liver disease, type 2 diabetes and IR are independently associated with rapid progression of liver fibrosis and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as the elevated rate of hepatic morbidity and mortality.The mechanisms underlying HCV-induced IR and DM are complex and poorly explained. The HCV genome is composed of structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (NS2-NS5B) genes. The complex effects of HCV core and nonstructural 5A (NS5A) proteins have been observed to play important roles in glucose metabolism. In normal circumstances, when insulin attaches to the hepatocyte receptor, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is phosphorylated and then causes activation of Akt. The activated Akt causes the translocation of glucose transporter-4 to the surface of the hepatocyte and facilitates glucose entry into the hepatocyte. Akt also induces the synthesis of glycogen and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. The HCV core protein impairs insulin signaling via several post-receptor mechanisms, including the activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family members and consequent decrease in IRS-1. The core protein also increases phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serine rather than tyrosine in hepatocytes, again preventing the downstream activation of Akt. HCV NS5A upregulates protein phosphatase 2A and inactivates Akt, which reduces the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT2, leading to a reduction in glucose uptake in the hepatocytes, and thus, induces IR. Additionally, HCV protein increases oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8, resulting in systemic effect including hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglycemia, and down-regulation of adiponectin. Epidemiological data suggest that all the major HCV genotypes lead to IR. Some viral-specific factors that influence glucose metabolism have also been discussed. Molecular evidence suggests that HCV core proteins in genotypes 3a and 1b promote IRS-1 degradation via different mechanisms. IR was clinically found to be associated with HCV genotype 1 and a high viral load, although the results were inconsistent.Elimination of HCV by interferon (IFN)-based regimen may perturb glucose homeostasis. Previous observational studies have shown that successful eradication of HCV improves IR in patients receiving IFN-based therapy. The \u03b2-cell hyperfunction is also ameliorated after antiviral treatment. Therefore, elimination or suppression of HCV can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes. However, a few studies revealed no change in fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) after antiviral treatment. The results of these studies are inconsistent, but they indicate that the benefits of glucose metabolism may also be HCV genotype specific.Treatment has dramatically improved in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). These modern drugs have extremely high treatment efficacy, safety, and less adverse events. These new medications have a higher rate of viral clearance than IFN-based therapy but lack the direct effect of IFN on glucose metabolism. Moreover, the impact of HCV clearance by DAAs on glucose abnormalities remains to be evaluated.Given the presumption that chronic HCV infection involves the development of IR, we hypothesized that HCV eradication by DAAs treatment could improve IR. The aim of the present study was to explore potential factors associated with IR in chronic HCV-infected patients and to assess the impact of HCV elimination on glucose homeostasis in patients who received DAAs therapies.MethodsStudy DesignThis was a single-center, observational study. Chronic HCV-infected patients with DAAs treatment were enrolled. Laboratory data including glucose parameters at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment were measured. Several factors associated with baseline high IR were analyzed. Further, we calculated the dynamic changes in IR and \u03b2-cell secretion function in patients whose viruses were successfully eradicated. This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study design was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Mackay Memorial Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from the study participants.PatientsWe enrolled patients with chronic HCV infection who underwent treatment with IFN-free DAAs therapy between January 2017 and July 2020. The inclusion criteria were patients (1) aged \u2265 20 years; (2) with detectable HCV viral load in the blood prior to treatment; (3) who agreed to receive laboratory testing at baseline, during antiviral treatment, and at 12 weeks after treatment; and (4) who provided informed consent. Patients were excluded if they: (1) missed regular clinical follow-ups after treatment; (2) had a medical history of DM or used glucose-lowering drugs; (3) died from other etiology during the study period; and (4) had concurrent conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus or HBV coinfection, Wilson\u2019s disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Basic patient information, body mass index (BMI), HCV viral loads and genotype, alcohol consumption, and medical history were collected. Patients received different DAAs regimens, including asunaprevir + daclatasvir (2.5%), paritaprevir + ritonavir + ombitasvir + dasabuvir (7.8%), elbasvir + grazoprevir (10.7%), glecaprevir + pibrentasvir (16.6%), and sofosbuvir-based regimens (62.4%). Each patient received one of these DAAs regimens based on the HCV genotype, previous treatment status, presence of cirrhosis, current medications, and comorbidities.Laboratory ExaminationsInfection with chronic HCV was defined as persistent viremia for at least six months before treatment. Serum HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels were quantified using a Roche Amplicor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, in which the lowest level of detection was 15 IU/mL. HCV genotyping was performed using primer-specific PCR and direct PCR deep sequencing with an ABI 3730 sequencer. The sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA levels 12 weeks following treatment cessation. Information on the levels of fasting glucose, insulin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, alpha-fetoprotein, white blood cells (WBC), as well as hemoglobin and platelets at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment were collected. We used Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index as the non-invasive measurement for hepatic fibrosis. The FIB-4 index was calculated using the following formula: (AST [IU/L] \u00d7 age [years])/(platelet count [109/L] \u00d7 ALT [IU/L]1/2).The glucose homeostasis was assessed by the HOMA method. The formulas for the HOMA model are as follows: HOMA-IR = fasting glucose (mg/dL) \u00d7 fasting insulin level (\u03bcU/mL)/405; HOMA-\u03b2 = fasting insulin level (\u03bcU/mL) \u00d7 360/(fasting glucose [mg/dL]\u201363). We dichotomized patients at a cutoff point of HOMA-IR 2.5 and analyzed factors associated with IR.Statistical AnalysisCategorical data are presented as numbers (percentages) and continuous variables are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The significance of the difference between categorical variables was determined using the Chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test depending on the sample size; continuous variables were compared using Student\u2019s t-test. For continuous variables with wide distribution, we presented data as median (interquartile range) and applied the Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the differences. After univariate analysis, we performed multivariable logistic regression modelling to identify factors that were independently associated with baseline high IR. To compare quantitative glucose parameters between baseline and post-treatment, we performed Paired t-test. All statistical analyses were defined as two-sided hypotheses with a significance level defined at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).ResultsBaseline CharacteristicsDuring the study period, 704 patients were treated with IFN-free DAAs. We excluded 192 patients with medical history of DM or who used glucose-lowering drugs. Additionally, 65 patients were excluded from the study due to failure of checking insulin levels at either baseline or follow-up (n=34), missing regular follow-up (n=24), and death during treatment (n=7). Finally, we enrolled 447 patients in the study. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, glucose parameters, DAAs regimens, and treatment responses are shown in  Table\u00a01 . The patients were predominantly women (52.8%), with a mean BMI of 25.5 \u00b1 4.5 kg/m2, which was in the upper range of normal weight. The most frequent HCV genotype was genotype 1 (53.7%), followed by genotype 2 (35.1%). The prevalence of high viral loads (> 80 \u00d7 104 IU/mL) was 67.3%.

Univariate analysis ( Table\u00a02 ) showed that several factors were significantly associated with high IR, including indigenous race, high BMI (> 25 kg/m2), alcoholism, baseline elevated levels of ALT, alpha-fetoprotein, and triglyceride, as well as hepatic fibrosis (defined as FIB-4 > 3.25). The association between IR and older age was not significant (p=0.073). For virus-specific parameters, HCV genotype 1 and HCV treatment experience were significantly associated with high IR (both p < 0.01). The baseline HCV viral load did not influence IR in our patients (p=0.953). Baseline bilirubin, creatinine, uric acid, WBC counts, hemoglobin, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were not significantly associated with baseline high IR.Univariate analysis of baseline factors associated with HOMA-IR.Factors \tHOMA-IR \u2265 2.5 (n = 157)\tHOMA-IR < 2.5 (n = 290)\tp value\t \tMale gender\t68 (43.3)\t89 (56.7)\t0.225\t \tAge (mean \u00b1 SD)\t61.6 \u00b1 12.2\t59.3 \u00b1 13.5\t0.073\t \tIndigenous race\t59 (37.6)\t82 (28.3)\t0.043\t \tBMI (kg/m2, mean \u00b1 SD)\t28.6 \u00b1 5.0\t24.3 \u00b1 3.7\t0.000\t \tBMI > 25\t102 (65.8)\t106 (37.2)\t0.000\t \tAlcoholism\t18 (11.5)\t16 (5.5)\t0.024\t \tBaseline HCV viral load > 80 x 104 IU/mL\t106 (67.5)\t195 (67.2)\t0.953\t \tHCV genotype 1\t99 (63.1)\t141 (48.6)\t0.003\t \tTreatment experience\t27 (17.2)\t18 (6.2)\t0.000\t \taALT (IU/L, median (IQR))\t60.0 (64.5)\t39.5 (56.0)\t0.000\t \taAlpha-fetoprotein (ng/mL, median (IQR))\t5.2 (7.5)\t3.2 (3.0)\t0.000\t \tTriglyceride (mg/dL, mean \u00b1 SD)\t113.6 \u00b1 72.6\t90.6 \u00b1 45.6\t0.000\t \tCholesterol (mg/dL, mean \u00b1 SD)\t168.8 \u00b1 37.1\t173.2 \u00b1 34.8\t0.261\t \tWBC (103/\u00b5L, mean \u00b1 SD)\t5586 \u00b1 1660\t5422 \u00b1 1620\t0.312\t \tFIB-4 > 3.25\t63 (40.1)\t67 (23.1)\t0.000\t \tCategorical data are presented as number (percentage).These continuous variables showed wide distribution.

To analyze the relationship between viral elimination and changes in glucose parameters, HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2 were considered as continuous variables ( Table\u00a04 ). HOMA-IR did not change significantly from baseline to 12-weeks after treatment (2.74 \u00b1 2.78 to 2.54 \u00b1 2.20, p = 0.128). There was a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell secretion stress (121.0 \u00b1 110.1 to 107.6\u00a0\u00b1 93.0, p = 0.015). In patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, we observed a significant improvement in mean IR (5.31 \u00b1 3.39 to 3.68 \u00b1 2.57, p < 0.001). Additionally, the subgroup analysis revealed that a statistically significant reduction in mean IR after DAAs therapies was observed in patients with HCV genotype 1 (3.05 \u00b1 3.11 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.05, p = 0.027) and treatment experience (4.00 \u00b1 3.37 to 3.01 \u00b1 2.49, p = 0.039) ( Figure\u00a01 ). However, in patients with baseline HOMA-IR < 2.5, there was a significant increase in mean IR after HCV eradication. We also analyzed pre- and post-treatment HOMA-IR in patients with different races, BMI, HCV viral loads, baseline laboratory results, and FIB-4 score. There was no significant difference in HOMA-IR between values at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment.The change of glucose parameters among patients with SVR.Patients\tHOMA-IR \tHOMA-\u03b2\t \tBaseline \tPost-treatment\tp value\tBaseline \tPost-treatment\tp value\t \tTotal patients (n = 438)\t2.74 \u00b1 2.78\t2.54 \u00b1 2.20\t0.128\t121.0 \u00b1 110.1\t107.6 \u00b1 93.0\t0.015\t \tBaseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5 (n = 153)\t5.31 \u00b1 3.39\t3.68 \u00b1 2.57\t0.000\t190.5 \u00b1 127.6\t141.5 \u00b1 116.1\t0.000\t \t< 2.5 (n = 285)\t1.36 \u00b1 0.59\t1.93 \u00b1 1.69\t0.000\t83.7 \u00b1 77.0\t89.3 \u00b1 71.6\t0.306\t \tBMI > 25 (n = 204)\t3.49 \u00b1 3.45\t3.20 \u00b1 2.48\t0.205\t153.7 \u00b1 136.2\t133.2 \u00b1 104.3\t0.049\t \tBMI < 25 (n = 227)\t2.06 \u00b1 1.77\t1.96 \u00b1 1.72\t0.445\t92.0 \u00b1 68.3\t85.0 \u00b1 74.9\t0.168\t \tHCV genotype 1 (n = 236)\t3.05 \u00b1 3.11\t2.62 \u00b1 2.05\t0.027\t121.2 \u00b1 112.8\t105.8 \u00b1 89.6\t0.045\t \tGenotype non-1 (n = 202)\t2.37 \u00b1 2.31\t2.44 \u00b1 2.37\t0.684\t120.7 \u00b1 107.2\t109.6 \u00b1 96.9\t0.163\t \tTreatment experience (n = 41)\t4.00 \u00b1 3.37\t3.01 \u00b1 2.49\t0.039\t161.5 \u00b1 133.7\t152.9 \u00b1 178.9\t0.761\t \tTreatment na\u00efve (n = 397)\t2.61 \u00b1 2.69\t2.48 \u00b1 2.17\t0.371\t116.8 \u00b1 106.7\t102.9 \u00b1 77.9\t0.010\t \tBaseline high ALT (n = 219)\t3.29 \u00b1 3.31\t2.89 \u00b1 2.41\t0.064\t130.0 \u00b1 112.5\t121.7 \u00b1 112.2\t0.336\t \tBaseline high triglyceride (n = 219)\t3.24 \u00b1 3.10\t2.86 \u00b1 2.20\t0.056\t137.1 \u00b1 119.2\t115.2 \u00b1 83.4\t0.006\t \tFIB-4 > 3.25 (n = 125)\t3.79 \u00b1 4.08\t3.27 \u00b1 2.94\t0.137\t139.3 \u00b1 123.1\t123.9 \u00b1 122.6\t0.210\t \tFIB-4 < 3.25 (n = 313)\t2.32 \u00b1 1.91\t2.25 \u00b1 1.75\t0.554\t113.7 \u00b1 103.8\t101.0 \u00b1 77.3\t0.035\t \tALT, alanine aminotransferase; BMI, Body mass index; FIB-4, Fibrosis-4; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HOMA, homeostasis model assessment; IR, insulin resistance; SVR, sustained virological response.The bold fonts means a p value less than 0.05.The change of insulin resistance (IR) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with direct-acting antiviral agents. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR at baseline and 12-weeks after antiviral treatment were measured. In general, there was no significant change in mean HOMA-IR. In subgroup analysis, IR significantly reduced after antiviral treatment in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience.DiscussionWe presented an observational analysis of glucose homeostasis in patients with chronic HCV infection and the outcomes of HCV elimination by DAAs therapy. We identified several factors contributing to IR in non-diabetic patients with chronic HCV infection. Obesity, elevated ALT and triglyceride levels, treatment experience, and advanced fibrosis were independently associated with IR. Obesity and metabolic syndrome were generally validated as risk factors for IR. In our result, serum levels of triglyceride, a well-known predictor of type 2 diabetes, were also independently related to IR. HCV NS5A and core proteins are known to directly inhibit microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity. The accumulation of hepatic triglycerides reduces insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and enhances hepatic gluconeogenesis, consequently leading to hepatic and peripheral IR. We did not observe any virus-specific effects of IR. Neither HCV genotype nor viral loads were observed to be independent factors for HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5. At the molecular level, the core protein of genotype 3a promotes degradation of IRS-1 via downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) and upregulation of SOCS-7; and the core protein of genotype 1b interferes with the insulin signaling by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin. Previous studies have investigated the association of HCV genotype 1 with IR, but the results were inconsistent. In the present study, we also observed a higher prevalence of IR in patients with HCV genotype 1. However, the statistical power was attenuated in multivariable logistic regression analysis. This could be because that the genotype-specific mechanisms interfering with the insulin signaling pathway only partially influenced systemic IR. The established risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia, remain the major contributors of IR in HCV-infected patients.The multivariable logistic regression analysis in the present study demonstrated that treatment experience and advanced hepatic fibrosis were independently associated with IR. These findings were less discussed in previous articles. As explained earlier, the HCV core protein and NS5A have complex effects on the insulin signaling pathway, influence hepatic and systemic glucose homeostasis, and thus, induce IR. We hypothesized that prolonged inflammation resulting from chronic HCV infection is associated with dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. A previous history of treatment with IFN-based therapy may imply a longer duration of infection with HCV. Additionally, hepatic fibrosis indirectly supports the probability of a longer inflammation by HCV infection. In HCV-infected liver, inflammation is a key process to drive the fibrogenic response. The immune system secretes proinflammatory cytokines and profibrogenic factors, leading to hepatocellular injury, production of extracellular matrix, proliferation of myofibroblasts, and stimulation of fibrosis. Our finding revealed an association between hepatic fibrosis and IR. It is noteworthy that our result only supported a correlation, not a causal relationship. Advanced liver fibrosis may impair insulin clearance, resulting in elevated serum insulin levels. On the contrary, IR also contributes to the progression of liver fibrosis. The mechanism could be a direct stimulation of liver stellate cells by hyperinsulinemia, resulting in increased production of the connective tissue growth factor and subsequent accumulation of extracellular matrix.We analyzed the outcome of glucose homeostasis in chronic HCV patients receiving DAAs. There was a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell stress. As mentioned earlier, levels of hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 decrease in HCV-infected patients. Clearance of HCV is accompanied by normalization of hepatic expression of IRS and improved \u03b2-cell function, which then influences glucose homeostasis. The IR remained statistically unchanged after DAAs therapy. This result is consistent with the results of previous studies that observed no difference in HOMA-IR between baseline and post-treatment phases in patients with HCV who underwent treatment. However, this contradicts the hypothesis that IR may be improved after HCV eradication, especially as HCV infection is a risk factor for the development of diabetes. There may be several explanations for the lack of an association between SVR and improvement of IR. The development of IR in HCV-infected patients could be a combination of both host- and virus-mediated pathways. The complex hepatic and non-hepatic mechanisms affecting glucose homeostasis may lead to heterogeneous post-SVR outcomes regarding IR. We performed subgroup analysis for further elucidation of the possible causal relationship. We observed a significant improvement in IR in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, which indirectly supports that HCV is an important contributor to IR, especially among patients with high-IR status. Additionally, this high-IR status could be reversed after HCV elimination by DAAs. Our subgroup analysis suggested that elimination of HCV genotype 1 was also associated with reduced IR. This relationship was not observed in patients with other genotypes. The result is consistent with previous research, which showed that successful viral clearance was found to be associated with reduced HOMA-IR in patients with HCV genotype 1. The genotype-specific outcome of IR suggested the direct viral effect as an important contributor to glucose abnormalities. In our result, advanced hepatic fibrosis was independently associated with IR. However, we did not observe a significant improvement in IR after HCV eradication in patients with advanced fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is a chronic process. Patients who received DAA therapy could have a rapid decrease in inflammation rather than regression of fibrosis. The duration of our study seemed too short for significant hepatocyte remodeling or IR improvement.As discussed above, patients with chronic HCV infection show an increased risk of IR and progression to type 2 DM. There are no definite virus-specific factors associated with the increasing prevalence of IR. Thus, we suggest that all patients with HCV infection be screened for glucose abnormalities. It will help physicians to identify patients who have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and may require active surveillance, as diabetes can also increase the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the advent of DAAs, we may be able to eradicate HCV with greater certainty and a lower risk of adverse effects. An SVR is generally associated with normalization of liver enzymes, improvement in liver function, as well as regression of liver necroinflammation and fibrosis. Compared with untreated patients, patients whose HCV was eliminated by DAAs have a significantly lower risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, after successful virus elimination by treatment with DAAs, improvement in IR can be an additional benefit and may reduce diabetes-related morbidities. A prospective study found that HCV eradication by DAAs reduces the incidence of type 2 DM. However, a general worsening of the lipid profile after DAAs was observed. The impact of the balance between improved glucose metabolism and negative changes in lipid profile on the outcome of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk must be determined. A significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events has recently been observed following HCV clearance by DAAs. Further research is required to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.This study has some limitations. First, this was an observational, open-label study and had the potential for selection bias. Second, a majority of the patients (98.0%) achieved SVR; therefore, it was impossible to compare glucose outcomes between patients with successful eradication and those with treatment failure. Third, the short-term study failed to demonstrate an improvement in IR; thus, the long-term outcome should be investigated to understand the effect of virus elimination on glucose homeostasis. Finally, we could not clarify the impact of HCV infection duration on IR, and could only demonstrate that treatment experience and advanced hepatic fibrosis were associated with IR.In conclusion, we showed that obesity, treatment experience, baseline elevated levels of ALT and triglyceride, as well as advanced hepatic fibrosis were independently associated with high IR in chronic HCV-infected patients. The prevalence of IR was not influenced by HCV genotypes and viral load. This study provided evidence that HCV-related IR could be partially reversed by HCV eradication, especially in patients with high baseline IR, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience. Further research for long-term outcomes of glucose homeostasis and diabetes-related morbidities in chronic HCV patients receiving DAAs is required.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics StatementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of Mackay Memorial Hospital.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel).

Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+. The 18 significantly enriched pathways share 66 unique genes with 61 of those upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC.Q-RT-PCR validation of individual gene expression data in CAFsTo confirm differential gene expression levels in the three breast cancer subtypes, Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC, we selected 6 genes (ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1, FZD1) with significantly different levels of expression based on our microarray studies and validated their expression levels by qRT-PCR. Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

Fibroblasts and macrophages which are responsible for the stroma production and maintenance are of the basic elements found in tumor microenvironment. Cellular density and ratio of stromal cells to tumor cells can also have modulatory effects in cancer. Here, the contribution of fibroblast and/or macrophage cells on the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells was modeled in co-culture systems. Co-cultures were established at different cell densities and ratios with 4T1 breast cancer, NIH/3T3 or 3T3-L1 fibroblast, and J774A.1 monocyte/macrophage cell lines. Flow cytometry-based proliferation, 3D growth on alginate matrix, and matrigel invasion assays were performed to determine the change in the malignant assets of tumor cells. The data were also supported by immunocytochemical and morphological analyses. Co-culturing with fibroblasts (especially, NIH/3T3 cells) significantly supported the proliferation, scattering, and invasiveness of 4T1 cells whereas inclusion of macrophages disrupted this positive influence. On the other hand, the invasion capacity of 4T1 cells was not enhanced in the co-cultures with fibroblasts whose motility were inhibited with pertussis toxin pretreatment. Particularly at low-density seeding in 3D cultures, 4T1 cells could form substantially more spheroids than that of in the co-cultures with fibroblasts. Only, increasing the amount of fibroblasts could restore the 3D-growth. Intriguingly, co-existence of macrophage, fibroblast, and tumor cells in 3D cultures provided a convenient stroma sustaining the spheroid formation and growth. In conclusion, fibroblasts can form a favorable environment for tumor cells' spread and motility whereas restricting their 3D-growth capacity. On the other hand, presence of macrophages may disrupt the influence of fibroblasts and enhance the spheroid formation by the tumor cells. ",

IntroductionBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and the majority of breast cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis. The lung, brain, bone and liver are the preferential sites of breast cancer metastasis. Lung metastasis is particularly concerning because it is associated significantly with patients\u2019 morbidity and mortality rate. Current therapeutic methods for metastatic breast cancer are ineffective, and there is no reliable method to predict the development of metastatic lesions. A better understanding of the mechanisms that drive breast cancer metastasis is crucial to identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer.Lung metastasis of breast cancer cells involves several processes and is regulated by mediators secreted in primary tumors. The murine 4T1 breast cancer is a triple-negative (TN) subtype of breast cancer and a subclone of the original mammary tumor that arose in a BALB/c mouse foster-nursed by a C3H female mouse. BALB/c mice injected with 4T1 cells into mammary pads spontaneously develop lung metastases, similar to TN breast cancer patients. Unlike other transplantable cancer models, 4T1 cells consist of heterogenous clonal subpopulations with different morphology, behaviors and gene expression profiles. These unique features of 4T1 cells make them a terrific model to analyze the complex mechanisms involved in the lung metastasis of breast cancer cells.The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/CCL2 is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and has been shown to play an important role in the recruitment of immunosuppressive, proangiogenic tumor-associate macrophages (TAMs) and the promotion of lung metastasis of breast cancer cells. In both human breast cancer patients and a murine breast cancer model, non-tumor stromal cells are important sources of MCP-1. To develop potential therapeutic modalities to inhibit MCP-1 production in tumor microenvironments (TMEs), we previously analyzed the crosstalk between 4T1 breast cancer cells and macrophages and identified cancer cell-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF/CSF2) as a potential key molecule that regulates high-level MCP-1 production in breast cancer TMEs. However, neutralization of GM-CSF or deletion of the Csf2 gene in cancer cells had little effect on the overall MCP-1 production in tumor-bearing mice, indicating the presence of additional mechanisms that induce MCP-1 production in TMEs.Fibroblasts are a major component of tumor stroma, and those activated by growth factors and associated with cancer are termed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs express several markers, including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA; also known as actin alpha 2), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and PDGF receptor-\u03b1 (PDGFR\u03b1) and PDGFR\u03b2. Activation by growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), PDGFs and fibroblast growth factor-2, results in the production of cytokines and chemokines important for cancer progression, leading to the hypothesis that fibroblasts activated by a product(s) of 4T1 cells significantly contribute to the overall MCP-1 production in 4T1 tumors.In the present study, we examined the presence of crosstalk between cancer cells and fibroblasts that could contribute to the production of MCP-1 in the 4T1 TME both in vitro and in vivo. For in vivo experiments, we focused on the early phase of tumor development (1 to 2 weeks after cancer cell inoculation) when MCP-1 production in tumors appeared most active and metastatic foci in the lung were initially established. We first identified in vitro that PDGFs released by 4T1 cells were potent inducers of MCP-1 production by fibroblasts and that an inhibitor of PDGFRs almost completely inhibited 4T1 cell-induced MCP-1 production by fibroblasts. However, inhibition of PDGFRs had no effect in vivo. Histologically, 4T1 tumors contained only a small number of activated fibroblasts, and Mcp-1 mRNA was mostly associated with macrophages by in situ hybridization (ISH), likely contributing to the lack of reduction in MCP-1 production by PDGFR antagonists. Better understanding the mechanisms of interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells is crucial to identifying new molecular targets and to develop new cancer treatments.2.

The generation of GM-CSF-deficient 4T1 cells (A8) was previously reported. To generate 4T1 cell culture supernatant (4T1-sup), 4T1 cells were grown in the complete medium in T-75 tissue culture flasks. When the color of the media turned slightly yellow, cell-free supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 10 min. Cell-free supernatants were concentrated by using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifuge filters (Merck Millipore Ltd., Cork, Ireland).2.3. FibroblastsNIH/3T3 cells (Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank, Osaka, Japan) were grown in DMEM supplemented by 10% FBS, 100 \u03bcM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Lung fibroblasts were isolated from normal BALB/c mice, as previously described. In brief, lungs were isolated under sterile conditions, minced into small fragments (1 mm3), placed on tissue culture plates containing high glucose DMEM with 15% FBS and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a 15% CO2 atmosphere for 5 days. Lung tissues were removed from the plates, and fibroblasts were grown to 80% confluence and then transferred to T-75 flasks. Fibroblasts were harvested by trypsin-EDTA and used.2.4. Activation of FibroblastsFor co-culture experiments, 1 \u00d7 104 3T3 cells were seeded in 24-well plates with different numbers of 4T1 cells. After overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the medium was replaced by 0.5 mL fresh complete medium, and cells were incubated for an additional 4 days at 37 \u00b0C.

Cell-free culture supernatants were collected and stored at \u221230 \u00b0C until use. For stimulation of normal mouse fibroblasts, 5 \u00d7 104 fibroblasts were seeded into 24-well plates. After overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the medium was replaced by a fresh medium containing different concentrations of 4T1-sup. After a 24-h incubation, cell-free culture supernatants were collected and stored at \u221230 \u00b0C until use.To evaluate the effects of PDGFs on fibroblasts, 5 \u00d7 104 3T3 cells were seeded into 24-well plates. After overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the medium was replaced by 0.5 mL fresh medium containing recombinant PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB and the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. Cell-free culture supernatants were collected and stored at \u221230 \u00b0C until use.To block PDGFR, 5 \u00d7 104 3T3 cells were seeded into 24-well plates. After overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the medium was replaced by 0. 5 mL fresh medium containing DMSO or 0.2 or 2 \u03bcM crenolanib. After a 30-min incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the same volume of medium or 4T1-sup was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Cell-free culture supernatants were collected and stored at \u221230\u2103 until use. Total RNA was extracted 1 h after stimulation and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.2.5. Transplantation of 4T1 CellsWild-type female BALB/c mice were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan, MD. One million 4T1 cells or A8 cells were grown to 50% to 80% confluence in T-75 tissue culture flasks in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin and sodium pyruvate. Cells were detached with 0.2% trypsin-EDTA, washed once with medium, three times with PBS and resuspended in PBS at 1 \u00d7 106/mL. One hundred \u03bcL of cell suspension (1 \u00d7 105 cells) was injected into the left 3rd mammary pad of female mice. Blood was collected by heart puncture, and sera were isolated and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. The tumors were harvested, and a half was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Wako) and the other half was in RNAlater. Tumor length and width were measured using a caliper, and tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: Volume = (width) 2 \u00d7 length/2.To block PDGFR, 20 mg/kg of trapidil dissolved in PBS or PBS was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected twice a day for 7 days from day 5. One hundred \u03bcg/kg of crenolanib in 0.5 mL PBS or 0.5 mL of 0.1% DMSO in PBS was also i.p. injected twice a day for 3 days from day 5. Twelve hours after the final injection, mice were euthanized. In another experiment, 0.1 mL of 10 \u03bcM crenolanib in PBS was intratumorally (i.t.) injected 3 or 5 times every 12 h from day 5, and the mice were euthanized 12 h after the final injection.2.6. Activation of Macrophages by Necrotic CellsMouse peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were induced by intraperitoneal injection of 3% thioglycollate and harvested 3\u20134 days later by peritoneal lavage using 5 mL cold PBS. After centrifugation, peritoneal exudate cells were resuspended in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin at the concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 and then cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of stimuli. Ten million 4T1 or A8 cells were rinsed with PBS twice, resuspended in 1.5 mL PBS and then kept at \u221280 \u00b0C for 6 h. The frozen cells were thawed and used to stimulate macrophages.2.7. Quantification of MCP-1 ConcentrationThe concentration of MCP-1 was measured using an ELISA kit specific for mouse MCP-1 (BioLegend) or by sandwich ELISA using anti-mouse MCP-1 antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). All samples were assayed in duplicate.2.8. Western Blotting4T1 cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), briefly sonicated, incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7 g for 10 min. The protein concentrations were measured by BCA protein assay. Ten \u00b5g of cell lysate was loaded on a precast polyacrylamide gel (Thermo-Fisher, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the proteins were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Life Technologies) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After overnight incubation with a primary antibody, the membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The presence of the protein of interest was visualized and quantitated with C-DiGit Blot scanner (Scrum, Tokyo, Japan).2.9. qRT-PCRThe expression of the Mcp-1/Ccl2 or Kc/Cxcl1 gene was assessed by qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from non-activated or activated 3T3 cells by using TRIsure or High Pure RNA Isolation Kit. The quality and yield were assessed by Nanodrop spectrophotometry, and then cDNA was synthesized using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). qRT-PCR was performed using the StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR system (Life Technologies). The expression of the Mcp-1, Kc and Gapdh mRNA was analyzed in duplicate by Taqman gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). The expression level of each gene was normalized to that of the Gapdh gene and presented as a fold change over the expression of the control gene. The values of control groups were assigned an arbitrary value of 1.2.10. RT-PCRThe expression of the Pdgf-a, b, c and d genes was examined by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated by TRIsure\u00ae reagent. Synthesis of cDNA was performed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits. The annealing temperature was 57 \u00b0C for PDGFa and 56 \u00b0C for PDGFb, c and d. The primer sequences were as follows: PDGFa forward, 5\u2032-CAAGACCAGGACGGTCATTT-3\u2032, PDGFa reverse, 5\u2032-ACTTTGGCCACCTTGACACT-3\u2032; PDGFb forward, 5\u2032-GATCTCTCGGAACCTCATCG-3\u2032, PDFGb reverse, 5\u2032-GGCTTCTTTCGCACAATCTC-3\u2032; PDGFc forward 5\u2032-GTCCATACGGGAAGAGCTAAAG-3\u2032, PDGFc reverse, 5\u2032-TCTACACACACAGTCACATTCC-3\u2032; PDGFd forward, 5\u2032-TGCCAACCTCAGGAGAGATGA-3\u2032, PDGFd reverse, 5\u2032-GCTGCTTCCGGTTGGAAATC-3\u2032.2.11. ImmunohistochemistryThe tumors were fixed overnight with buffered 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections of 4 \u03bcm thickness were prepared from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks collected as described above. One section was stained with H&E, and others were used for immunohistochemistry for each block. Immunostaining was performed manually by a conventional method: briefly, sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a sequence of descending concentrations of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase reactivity was blocked with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. For Ly6G staining, the sections were submerged in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and microwaved (700 W) continuously for 15 min in a pressure cooker. For F4/80 staining, the sections were treated with 200 \u03bcg/mL proteinase K (Roche) for 5 min at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with a respective primary antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature. After washing, the sections were treated with Histofine Simple StainTM MAX PO (Nichirei, Japan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted. Images were acquired using an Olympus BX43 light microscope connected to a DP73 digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).2.12. In Situ Hybridization (ISH)Spatial expression of the Mcp-1/Ccl2, adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E1 (Adgre1, the gene coding for F4/80) or \u03b1SMA mRNA in 4T1 tumors was analyzed by the RNAScope\u00ae 2.5 Duplex Detection Kit (ACD, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). Briefly, tissue sections in 5-\u03bcm thickness were baked for 1 h at 60 \u00b0C, deparaffinized in xylene, followed by dehydration in an ethanol series. The tissue sections were then treated in the retrieval buffer maintained at a boiling temperature (98 \u00b0C) on a hot plate for 20 min, rinsed in deionized water and treated with protease at 40 \u00b0C for 45 min in a Dako StatSpin Hybridizer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The tissue sections were then hybridized at 40 \u00b0C in a hybridization buffer with probes (mouse Mcp-1/Ccl2, C1 probe, #311791; mouse Adgre1, C2 probe, #460651-C2; mouse \u03b1SMA, C2 probe, #) for 3 h. After the hybridization, the tissue sections were washed with a wash buffer three times at room temperature, and then the signals were amplified. Chromogenic detection was performed using FastRed (Adgre1 or \u03b1SMA) or FastGreen (Mcp-1/Ccl2), followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. Photos were taken using an Olympus BX43 light microscope connected to a DP73 digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).2.13. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed by Student\u2019s t-test using the GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.3. Results3.1. A Product(s) of 4T1 Cells Induces MCP-1 Production by FibroblastsTo examine the presence of crosstalk between 4T1 cells and fibroblasts that may contribute to the production of MCP-1 in 4T1 tumors, we cultured 4T1 cells and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts separately or together for 4 days in tissue culture plates and measured the concentration of MCP-1 in the supernatants. 3T3 cells constitutively released a basal level of MCP-1, and approximately 2.1 ng/mL of MCP-1 was detected in the 3T3 cell supernatant. 4T1 cells also constitutively released a low level of MCP-1 in the culture supernatant as we previously reported, and approximately 0.7 to 0.9 ng/mL of MCP-1 was detected (Figure 1A). When 3T3 cells were co-cultured with 4T1 cells, the concentration of MCP-1 in the culture supernatant increased by five to seven-fold. Since the capacity of 4T1 cells to produce MCP-1 is limited even after stimulation, this result strongly suggested that a product(s) of 4T1 cells activated 3T3 cells and upregulated MCP-1 production. To test this possibility, we cultured 3T3 cells with different concentrations of 4T1 cell-free culture supernatants (4T1-sup). As shown in Figure 1B, 4T1-sup dose-dependently increased the concentration of MCP-1 in the culture supernatant. Additionally, we used mouse primary fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of two normal BALB/c mice (#1 and #2) and cultured them in the presence of 4T1-sup. The concentration of MCP-1 in the culture supernatants markedly increased in response to 4T1-sup (Figure 1C). These results indicated that 4T1 cells release a factor that upregulates the production of MCP-1 by fibroblasts.3.2. 4T1 Cells Produce and Release PDGFsMCP-1 is the product of the gene JE, one of the immediate early response genes induced in fibroblasts by PDGF, and several human breast cancer cell lines were found to produce PDGF in vitro, suggesting that MCP-1 production by fibroblasts in response to 4T1-sup may be due to PDGF. We first examined the kinetics of Mcp-1 mRNA expression by 3T3 cells after stimulation with 4T1-sup. The expression of Mcp-1 mRNA (Figure 2A, left panel) and Kc mRNA, another immediate early gene expressed by fibroblasts in response to PDGF (Figure 2A, right panel), was induced within 1 h after stimulation. These results supported the hypothesis that 4T1 cells produce PDGF(s) and activate fibroblasts to produce MCP-1.There are four subtypes of PDGF, namely, PDGFa, b, c and d. We examined the expression of these four PDGF subtypes by 4T1 cells by RT-PCR (Figure 2B). The expression of Pdgf-a, b and c mRNA, but not d mRNA, was readily detectable, and the production of PDGF-A protein was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 2C). Finally, recombinant murine PDGF-AA and BB markedly upregulated MCP-1 production by 3T3 cells (Figure 2D). These results suggested that 4T1 cells upregulate MCP-1 production by fibroblasts via PDGF production.3.3. The PDGF Receptor Inhibitor Crenolanib Inhibits 4T1 Cell-Induced MCP-1 Production by FibroblastsPDGFs bind to two closely related receptor tyrosine kinases, PDGFRA and PDGFRB. To evaluate the contribution of PDGFs to the 4T1-sup-induced upregulation of MCP-1 production by fibroblasts, we blocked PDGFRA and PDGFRB by crenolanib, a highly potent inhibitor of these two receptors. As shown in Figure 3A, Crenolanib showed no effect on the constitutive MCP-1 production by 3T3 cells but almost completely inhibited the increased MCP-1 production by 4T1-sup. Crenolanib also inhibited Mcp-1 mRNA expression induced by 4T1-sup (Figure 3B). Crenolanib was initially developed as a highly selective PDGFR inhibitor but later found to also inhibit FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3). Since FLT3 is expressed by hematopoietic cells but not by fibroblasts, the inhibitory effect of crenolanib in this experiment was considered via the blocking of PDGFRs. Crenolanib was also reported to inhibit cell proliferation, potentially influencing the level of MCP-1 in culture supernatants. However, Mcp-1 mRNA expression by 3T3 cells peaked within 1 h of stimulation with 4T1-sup (Figure 2A), and crenolanib treatment had no effect on constitutive MCP-1 production or mRNA expression at the concentrations of 0.2 and 2 \u03bcM (Figure 3A,B). Taken together, these results supported the conclusion that increased MCP-1 production by fibroblasts in response to 4T1-sup was due to the activation of PDGF receptors by cancer cell-derived PDGFs.3.4. PDGFR Antagonists Do Not Reduce the Level of MCP-1 in 4T1 Tumor-Bearing MiceWe previously examined the kinetics of serum MCP-1 level in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and found that the serum MCP-1 level significantly increased at 1 week, peaked at 3 weeks and then decreased at 4 weeks. Since the sizes of tumors were significantly different between these time points, we attempted to evaluate the MCP-1 production rate at each time point by dividing the serum MCP-1 level by tumor size. Interestingly, MCP-1 production in tumors appeared highest at 1 week, and it gradually decreased (Figure S1). Therefore, we evaluated the contribution of the crosstalk between cancer cells and fibroblasts via PDGFs to the increased MCP-1 level in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice in the early phase of tumor development. As noted above, crenolanib inhibits not only PDGFRs but also FLT3 and reduces cell proliferation. To minimize its systemic effects on both types of receptors and its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, we injected 0.1 mL of 10 \u00b5M crenolanib directly into tumors five times every 12 h. Intratumoral injection has been used to deliver agents into tumors to kill cancer cells or to activate immune cells. As shown in Figure 4A, there was no significant difference in tumor weight (left panel), Mcp-1 mRNA expression in tumors (middle panel) or serum MCP-1 concentration (right panel) between the crenolanib-treated group and the control group.We also injected 200 \u00b5g Trapidil twice per day for one week and collected sera and tumors. Trapidil was previously used to successfully block PDGFR in several animal disease models. Trapidil treatment had no effects on tumor weight (Figure 4B, left panel) or serum MCP-1 concentration (Figure 4B, right panel).We next transplanted GM-CSF-deficient, 4T1-derived clone A8 into WT mice and examined the effects of PDGFR inhibition (Figure 4C). Either i.p. or i.t. injection of crenolanib showed no effect on tumor weight (left panel), tumor Mcp-1 mRNA expression (middle panel) or serum MCP-1 protein level (right panel) even in the absence of cancer cell-derived GM-CSF. These results strongly suggested that the PDGF-PDGFR pathway does not play a major role in the overall MCP-1 production in the 4T1 tumor.3.5. MCP-1 Is Mainly Expressed by F4/80+ Macrophages, but Not by Fibroblasts, in 4T1 TumorsTo further evaluate the contribution of fibroblasts to the MCP-1 production in 4T1 tumors, we histologically examined tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Five days after cancer cell inoculation, strong infiltration of leukocytes (Figure 5A), including Ly6G+ neutrophils (Figure 5B) and F4/80+ macrophages (Figure 5C), was observed. By contrast, only a small number of \u03b1SMA+ fibroblasts were found in 4T1 tumors (Figure 5D).To determine MCP-1-producing cells in 4T1 tumors, we first used IHC; however, our attempts with multiple antibodies against murine MCP-1 were not successful. Therefore, we used in situ hybridization (ISH). By ISH, only a small number of Act2 mRNA (red)-positive fibroblasts were found in peritumoral and intratumoral areas, and most of the Mcp-1 mRNA (green)-positive cells were Act2 mRNA (red)-negative (Figure 5E,F). Mcp-1 mRNA (green) was mainly associated with Adgre1-positive macrophages (red) both in the peripheral area (Figure 5G) and inside tumors (Figure 5H).Fourteen days after cancer cell inoculation, the number of Act2 mRNA (red)-positive fibroblasts remained low, and Mcp-1 mRNA was not associated with Act2 mRNA-positive fibroblasts (Figure 6A, upper panels). A large number of Mcp-1 mRNA-positive cells were found around necrotic lesions, and the majority of Mcp-1 mRNA-positive cells were also positive for Adgre1 mRNA (Figure 6A, lower panels).The effect of necrotic cancer cells on MCP-1 production by macrophages was examined in vitro. Necrotic 4T1 cells significantly upregulated MCP-1 production by mouse macrophages (Figure 6B). Necrotic GM-CSF-deficient A8 cells also upregulated MCP-1 production by macrophages (Figure 6C). These results indicated that macrophages are the major MCP-1 producing cells in 4T1 tumors and suggested that tumor necrosis contributes to the MCP-1 production by macrophages.4. DiscussionFibroblasts are a major cellular component of cancer stroma and secrete regulatory molecules, such as growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, which are important for cancer progression. In the present study, we aimed to identify whether fibroblasts crosstalk with 4T1 breast cancer cells to produce MCP-1 in the TME. The co-culturing of mouse fibroblasts with 4T1 cells or activation of fibroblasts with the culture supernatant of 4T1 cells (4T1-sup) resulted in elevated levels of MCP-1 production by fibroblasts. 4T1 cells expressed three PDGF isoforms, PDGF-a, b and c. Inhibition of PDGFs-PDGFR interaction by crenolanib almost completely inhibited 4T1-sup-induced MCP-1 production in vitro, but it had no effect in vivo. Mcp-1 mRNA was mainly detected in Adgre1+ macrophages but not in Act2+ fibroblasts, likely CAFs. These results indicated that the crosstalk between 4T1 cells and fibroblasts indeed exists but is not significantly contributing to the MCP-1 production in the 4T1 breast cancer TME.Human breast cancer cell line cells, such as MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, produce and secrete PDGF. Although the exact role of PDGF in the development and progression of breast cancer remains unclear, PDGF is proposed as a potential target for breast cancer therapy. PDGF is a potent mitogen for fibroblasts and an inducer of CAFs, which produce a variety of cytokines and chemokines, including MCP-1. In this study, we demonstrated that 4T1 cells have the capacity to upregulate MCP-1 production by fibroblasts via the secretion of PDGFs. However, inhibitors of PDGFRs had no effects on tumor Mcp-1 mRNA expression or serum MCP-1 concentrations in tumor-bearing mice. Only a few Act2+ fibroblasts were present in 4T1 tumors on both days 5 and 14. Thus, PDGFs do not appear involved in the recruitment or proliferation of CAFs in the 4T1 tumor, and the lack of reduction in MCP-1 production by PDGFR inhibitors may be attributed to a low number of fibroblasts. Although CAFs might not be a major contributor to the MCP-1 production in the TME in an early phase of tumor development, as demonstrated here, it might be important in a later phase when an advanced tumor is established. It will also be interesting to examine the effects of long-term treatment by PDGFR inhibitors on the progression of 4T1 tumors, such as lung metastasis. Since the effectiveness of i.t. injection remains unproven, oral administration or the use of a subcutaneously implanted micropump that would provide a constant level of inhibitors in tumor microenvironments may be preferable. Additional studies are required to answer these questions.Unlike 4T1 tumors, CAFs are the most abundant component of tumor stroma, especially in breast and pancreatic cancers in humans; therefore, CAFs could be one of the major sources of MCP-1 in naturally arising tumors. The expression of MCP-1 in human invasive ductal breast cancer was previously studied by IHC. MCP-1 was detected in cancer cells in roughly 50% of cases. Among stromal cells, TAMs were the major MCP-1-positive cells in all studies. Positive staining of endothelial cells or fibroblasts was also noted as minor cell populations. Thus, despite the fact that CAFs are known to secrete MCP-1 in vitro, they may not significantly contribute to the production of MCP-1 in not only the 4T1 model but also naturally arising breast cancer. Additional studies using genetically engineered mouse models or breast cancer cell lines, such as EO771, would help us better understand the crosstalk between cancer cells and fibroblasts.It was previously reported that conditioned media of human breast cancer cell lines or primary breast cancer cells upregulated MCP-1 production by human fibroblasts. An increase in MCP-1 gene promoter activity in response to the conditioned media was abrogated by a STAT3 antagonist. Several cytokines were present in the conditioned media as determined by human cytokine antibody arrays, but PDGFs were not among them. In our study, increased MCP-1 production by 4T1-sup was almost completely blocked by the PDGFR inhibitor crenolanib, indicating that PDGFs were the major 4T1 cell products that activated fibroblasts. Several factors are known to activate fibroblasts, and the availability of those factors may differ in each breast cancer TME. The identification of factors involved in the activation of fibroblasts in each cancer may be important to properly target the treatment of cancer patients.We previously evaluated the contribution of myeloid and non-myeloid cells to the spontaneous lung metastasis of 4T1 cells by using BM chimera mice and found that either cell type was sufficient to promote lung metastasis of 4T1 cells, suggesting that stromal cells, such as fibroblasts, produce a sufficient amount of MCP-1 for lung metastasis of 4T1 cells. In the present study, Mcp-1 mRNA was mainly associated with Adgre1+ macrophages in tumors on both days 5 and 14 after the inoculation of cancer cells. To construct BM chimera, total-body irradiation and antibiotics treatment were required, and these procedures could affect the outcome of the experiment. Studies using genetically engineered mouse models will be useful to obtain more definitive answers as to the source of MCP-1 in this cancer model.Mcp-1 mRNA-positive cells 14 days after cancer cell inoculation were mainly Adgre1+ macrophages infiltrating around necrotic lesions. This may suggest that those macrophages were activated by molecules released from dying or necrotic cancer cells. We tested this possibility by treating mouse macrophages with necrotic 4T1 cells or GM-CSF-deficient 4T1 clone cells and found that both cell types induced MCP-1 production. Necrotic cells release molecules, called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins, among which HMGB1 is known to signal via toll-like receptor 4. Thus, the activation of macrophages with DAMPs is another mechanism for MCP-1 production in TMEs, but this mechanism may not function in an early stage of cancer development when necrosis of tumor cells is rare. It is likely that redundant, spatio-temporal activation mechanisms for macrophage activation are present in the 4T1 TME.In conclusion, we have identified a novel crosstalk between 4T1 cells and fibroblasts for MCP-1 production in the 4T1 TME. However, it appears to be just one of many redundant crosstalks between 4T1 cells and stromal cells present in the 4T1 TME, and it is clear that blocking a single pathway is not sufficient to significantly reduce MCP-1 production. We believe that careful analysis of crosstalk between cancer cells and stromal cells and identification of molecules used in each tumor will help us to find better ways to treat patients with cancer, including breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsSupplementary materials can be found at .Author ContributionsConceptualization, T.Y. and N.M.; investigation, M.I., T.Y., T.L., C.L. and M.F.; writing\u2014original draft, M.I. and T.Y.; writing\u2014review and editing, T.Y., N.M. and A.M.; Funding acquisition, T.Y. and A.M.

Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression. Stroma is composed of vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, and various types of infiltrating immune cells that might interact with each other and tumor cells. In most solid tumors, including breast cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are predominant cellular elements of the stroma. CAFs constitute a heterogeneous population. Multiple CAF subtypes with separate molecular profiles and different impact on tumor outgrowth have been identified in various types of cancer.Differential expression of markers such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), vimentin (VIM), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) is characteristic for CAFs. Nevertheless, these markers are far from being comprehensive or exclusively expressed by these subtypes of cells. Therefore, spindle-shape cell morphology is still a commonly used way to identify CAFs within the tumor stroma. CAFs were shown to promote cancer metastasis, as well as affect angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance via synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and production of growth factors. Thus, CAF-targeting treatment aimed at modifying their number, subtype, or features is a plausible strategy of improving patients\u2019 outcome in the future.Several studies have shown the significance of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in development and progression of different solid tumors. It was demonstrated that stromal expression of \u03b1-SMA correlate with a high number of lymph node metastases and worse clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs also enhanced angiogenesis and influenced tumor growth in\u00a0vivo, and correlated with higher frequency of cancer stem cells. Of note, depletion of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in pancreatic cancer suppressed immune surveillance by increasing CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in pancreatic cancer.Here, we aimed to better understand the role of \u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs in BC, with special interest in their impact on tumor growth and dissemination among molecular subtypes. We studied in detail CAF heterogeneity in luminal breast cancer (lumBC) at both the molecular and functional level. Using primary CAFs derived from tumor tissue of patients with lumBC, we demonstrated how heterogeneous expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs might determine tumor growth.MethodsPatientsPrimary tumors of 108 patients with breast cancer (inclusion criteria: nonlobular histology, stage I\u2013III) treated in the University Clinical Centre in Gda\u0144sk, Poland (2011\u20132013), were investigated and described previously. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017), and informed consent was collected from all participants.ImmunohistochemistryPreparation of tissue microarrays (TMA) containing primary breast cancer tissues and staining for ER, PgR, HER2, and Ki67 were performed as previously described. \u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and EpCAM (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone Ber-EP4, Dako Agilent) were stained and detected with EnVision FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL and OPN staining were performed manually using SNAIL mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 2G11, Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA, dilution 1:100) and OPN rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, dilution 1:1600) for 60\u00a0min at room temperature.For \u03b1-SMA, EpCAM, and SNAIL, staining intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) and percentage (0\u2013100%) of the stained stromal (\u03b1-SMA) or tumor cells (EpCAM, SNAIL) in the total number of stromal or tumor cells, respectively, were determined; index score was calculated as the percentage of positive cells multiplied by intensity, resulting in a score 0\u2013300. For OPN, only the intensity (0, negative; 1, weak; 2, intermediate; 3, strong) of staining in stroma cells was determined. The overall score corresponding to one patient was established. \u03b1-SMA high status was conferred to samples with index score higher than the upper quartile (Q3) of the whole group.Clinical data analysisKaplan\u2013Meier survival curves presenting overall survival (OS) in patients with low versus high \u03b1-SMA were compared using log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The chi-squared test or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to examine the distribution of \u03b1-SMA protein status among clinicopathological features (stage, grade, lymph node status). Differences in protein levels between groups were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney U test. p-Values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. All the analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 27 licensed for the University of Gda\u0144sk.Isolation of CAFs from breast cancerCAFs were isolated from tumor samples of four patients with lumBC (CAF2, CAF3, and CAF4 were isolated from patients with luminal B breast cancer, whereas CAF1 from luminal A) obtained from the Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical University of Gdansk (2017\u20132018) after patients\u2019 written informed consent. Each sample (1\u20133\u00a0cm) was collected by an experienced surgeon in aseptic conditions and transferred into DMEM (HyClone, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, GE Healthcare) and antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). Tissue sections were stored in 2\u20138\u00a0\u00b0C and transferred to the Laboratory of Translational Oncology where further processing started no later than 4\u00a0h after resection. Tissue sections were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS, minced, and digested enzymatically in 0.35\u00a0mg/ml collagenase (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.35\u00a0mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich) solution in 1\u00d7 PBS for 1\u00a0h with rotation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Disintegrated tissues were centrifuged at 400g for 5\u00a0min, and the pellet was transferred to a cell culture dish. CAFs were separated using serial trypsinization method. After two to three passages, CAFs were controlled for spindle-shape morphology and presence of CAFs markers VIM and \u03b1-SMA, and absence of tumor marker E-cadherin (E-cad).Cell culturePrimary CAFs were cultured in DMEM (HyClone, GE Healthcare) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, GE Healthcare) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO2. MCF7 (HTB-22), T47D (CRL-2865), and BJ (CRL-2522) cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. For all cell lines, the same batch of FBS was used. Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cultures of isolated CAFs and fibroblast cell line, BJ. When cells reached 80% confluency, the medium was changed, and conditioned medium was collected after 72\u00a0h.CAF characterizationImmunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on sterilized cover glass and after 24\u00a0h were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol\u2013acetone mix for 15\u00a0min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent) and incubated with cells for 30\u00a0min. Anti-\u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, dilution 1:1), anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1:1000), and anti-E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal, clone 36, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA, dilution 1:2000) antibody was used for CAF characterization. As secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 594 and anti-mouse IgG DyLight 488 were used (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; dilution 1:2000). Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).Western blotCell lysate was prepared using RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich), then protein concentration was measured with a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Proteins were separated using 12% polyacrylamide TGX gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad). Anti-\u03b1-SMA (mouse monoclonal, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, dilution 1:1), anti-vimentin (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, dilution 1:2000), and anti-E-cadherin (mouse monoclonal, clone 36, BD, dilution 1:500) antibodies were used for detection. Appropriate, secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies were used (Sigma Aldrich, dilution 1:100,000).ELISAOsteopontin concentration (ng/ml) in CAFs and BJ-CM was evaluated using human osteopontin (OPN) Quantikine ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Concentration was quantified by measuring the absorption at 450\u00a0nm with a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, USA).3D culture in MatrigelLumBC cell lines MCF7 and T47D were used to analyze influence of CAFs and BJ-CM on colony growth in 3D culture (Corning Matrigel). A total of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 tumor cells resuspended in DMEM were mixed with Matrigel 1:1 and placed into 12-well tissue culture plates. Three-dimensional cultures were then covered with CM from CAFs, BJ, and DMEM as a control, exchanged every third day. For experiments aiming at OPN neutralization, OPN-neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems) diluted 3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml was used. Tumor-cell colony growth was quantified by measuring the area of at least 40 colonies using Olympus IX83 microscope (10\u00d7 magnification) and ImageJ software. Data were presented as mean relative to DMEM\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. Comparative data were analyzed with the unpaired Student\u2019s t-test using the IBM SPSS statistics software. p-Values\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant.Multigene expression analysisRNA extractionRNA was isolated from CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA concentration and purity were determined using NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA extraction from lumBC samples (formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens) was performed as described.nCounter gene expression assayThe CAFs and clinical samples-derived RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300\u00a0ng) was subjected to expression profiling with nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. Analysis of RNA extracted from clinical samples was processed as described. NanoString data processingThe CAFs and clinical samples RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. Data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls included in the assay and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes, 18 (SD range 2.9\u201366.9 counts) and 4 (SD range 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) in the CAFs and clinical samples datasets, respectively. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples\u2009<\u20094 for CAFs dataset and\u2009<\u20096 for FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 320 and 584 transcripts in CAFs and FFPE dataset, respectively. Genes differentiating between \u03b1-SMAhigh and \u03b1-SMAlow samples were selected on the basis of log2 fold change (log2FC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in compared groups. Genes with log2FC\u2009>\u20091 were considered upregulated; genes with log2FC\u2009<\u2009\u22121 were considered downregulated in the \u03b1-SMAhigh group.Results\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs are associated with poor prognosis and more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells in patients with lumBC\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs correlate with poor prognosis and more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells in lumBC.

Mann\u2013Whitney U test was applied\u03b1-SMA was evaluated immunohistochemically in fibroblast-like stromal cells of 108 nonmetastatic primary breast tumors (Fig.\u00a01A). Staining was informative for 106 tumors, all of which showed expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs; importantly, there were considerable differences in the percentage of positive cells (5\u201390% cells of fibroblast-like morphology) and staining intensity (moderate in 31.7%, high in 68.3% of samples; no weak staining was observed).For further analysis, patients were divided into two groups, \u03b1-SMAlow (n\u2009=\u200993) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (n\u2009=\u200913), according to the upper quartile of the \u03b1-SMA staining index (equal 240). The distribution of \u03b1-SMA status in CAFs (low versus high) was compared with clinicopathological data, including dissemination status, and molecular data. There was no correlation between \u03b1-SMA level and stage, grade, lymph node status, or circulating tumor cell (CTC) presence and phenotype (Additional file 1: Table S1) in the whole analyzed cohort.Interestingly, only in the lumBC group, patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs had significantly poorer overall survival rate (p\u2009=\u20090.019, log-rank; Fig.\u00a01B). However, no further correlations with clinicopathological data or dissemination status were found in this subgroup (Additional file 1: Table S2). In terms of molecular markers evaluated immunohistochemically, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlated positively with SNAIL (p\u2009=\u20090.034) and EpCAM (p\u2009=\u20090.016) protein levels (Fig.\u00a01C), pointing to more aggressive phenotype, while no correlation was observed for other previously characterized proteins, i.e., SLUG, CXCR4, and TWIST (data not shown).\u03b1-SMA-positive CAFs increase outgrowth of breast cancer cell linesCharacterization of CAFs isolated from patients with BC.

Unpaired Student\u2019s t-test test was applied, ***p\u2009<\u20090.0001 calculated versus control (DMEM)To confirm adverse effect of \u03b1-SMA CAFs on lumBC, CAFs (n\u2009=\u20094) were isolated from primary lumBC tissue specimens and tested on their impact on breast cancer cell lines in\u00a0vitro. After three passages, isolated CAFs were analyzed for the presence of CAF- and tumor-related markers by immunofluorescent staining and western blot along with BJ normal fibroblasts and MCF7 cell line serving as controls. All obtained CAF cell lines stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-cad and presented spindle-shape morphology typical for fibroblasts (Additional file 2: Fig. S1A, B). On the basis of the \u03b1-SMA immunofluorescence staining, CAF cell lines were classified as \u03b1-SMAhigh (CAF3 and CAF4), with the majority of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells (i.e.,\u2009>\u200990%), or \u03b1-SMAlow (CAF1 and CAF2), with the majority of \u03b1-SMA-negative cells (i.e.,\u2009>\u200980%) (Fig.\u00a02A).CM collected from the established CAFs was applied to lumBC cell lines MCF7 and T47D in 3D Matrigel assay. CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs significantly increased MCF7 cells colonies growth in Matrigel (colony area fold change compared with control equaled 2.16 for \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs versus 4.16 for \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs, p\u2009=\u20090.0001) (Fig.\u00a02B, C). Similar observations were obtained for another lumBC cell line, T47D (Additional file 3: Fig. S2).As these results suggested that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs CM promote cancer cell proliferation, we analyzed phosphorylation of two nodal proteins governing pathways activating cell proliferation, AKT and ERK. However, no significant differences were observed in the expression and phosphorylation of those proteins when MCF7 cells were cultured in 2D and treated with CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh or \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs (data not shown).Since in clinical material \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlated with higher expression of SNAIL and EpCAM, we performed qPCR expression analysis of these genes in lumBC cell lines treated with CAFs CM. CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs did not induce expression of SNAIL and EpCAM in lumBC cells (data not shown).Osteopontin is expressed and secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs\u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-secreted osteopontin increases tumor growth.

G Ki67 percentage in patients with different OPN staining intensity\u2014negative to moderate (neg-to-mod) and strong, evaluated immunohistochemically. Mann\u2013Whitney U test was appliedTo identify the potential mechanism accounting for promotion of tumor growth by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs, multigene expression analysis of four isolated CAF cell lines (two \u03b1-SMAhigh versus two \u03b1-SMAlow) was performed using nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString). Differential gene expression analysis identified 29 genes that were upregulated (logFC\u2009>\u20091, i.e., ITGB2, TNFSF4, CXCL6, VCAM1, and OPN) in \u03b1-SMAhigh compared with \u03b1-SMAlow isolated CAFs. They are, e.g., linked with positive regulation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity, as revealed by Gene Ontology analysis. In turn, downregulation was noted for 25 genes (logFC\u2009<\u2009\u22121, i.e., NFATC2, MASP1, KIT, IL17RB, and CXCL14) involved in tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a03A, Additional file 4: Table S3).Then we examined whether the same differences in genes expression were observed in clinical tissue samples from patients with \u03b1-SMAlow versus \u03b1-SMAhigh lumBC. To highlight the most significant differences between those two groups, scores lower than the lower quartile (Q1) of index score were considered as \u03b1-SMAlow, whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh status was claimed for tissues with scores above the upper quartile (Q3). Only one gene, OPN, was significantly upregulated (logFC\u2009>\u20091), and five genes, HLA-DPB1, MS4A1, IL6, CMA1, and REL, were downregulated (logFC\u2009<\u2009\u22121) in patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh (Fig.\u00a03B, Additional file 4: Table S4). Here no interactions were revealed.Interestingly, OPN was the only gene demonstrating upregulation both in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs isolated from lumBC and tumor samples of lumBC with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs. Consequently, we assessed the secretion of OPN by CAFs in\u00a0vitro. ELISA assay indeed revealed significantly higher level of OPN protein in the CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh compared with \u03b1-SMAlow isolated CAFs (FC 4; p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03C).In accordance with this observation, when analyzed immunohistochemically in the lumBC tissue material, OPN protein was present in CAF cytoplasm and their surrounding in 51% of samples, mostly scored as weak\u20141 (41.8%), moderate\u20142 (38.1%), and strong\u20143 (20.1%) staining (Fig.\u00a03D). Strong OPN staining was observed in 20% (21/108) of \u03b1-SMAhigh samples when analyzed in individual tumor fragments. OPN expression was also noted in cancer cells, as cytoplasmic or nuclear staining (in 30% and 19% of lumBC samples, respectively). Although in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis OPN-positive fibroblasts were reported to accumulate in perivascular spaces, such pattern was not observed in the analyzed breast tumors.OPN secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs induces lumBC cell colony growthTo further assess the functional significance of CAFs-delivered OPN in lumBC, we performed 3D Matrigel assay. MCF7 and T47D cells were cultured in Matrigel and incubated with different CAF- or BJ-derived CM supplemented or not with OPN-neutralizing antibodies. We observed that addition of OPN-neutralizing antibody decreased colony growth of MCF7 in Matrigel only in cells treated with CM derived from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (colony area fold change compared with control 4.16 for CAFs CM without OPN-neutralizing antibodies versus 2.87 for CM CAFs with OPN-neutralizing antibodies, p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.\u00a03E, F). In case of CM from \u03b1-SMAlow CAFs and BJ cell line, the area of colonies remained unchanged (Fig.\u00a03E, F). Similar results were obtained for another lumBC cell line, T47D (Additional file 3: Fig. S2). In accordance with this observation, OPN strong CAF-associated staining correlated positively with the higher number of Ki67-positive tumor cells assessed immunohistochemically in clinical samples (lumBC, p\u2009=\u20090.012, Fig.\u00a03G).DiscussionTME and its components such as CAFs play an important role in breast cancer progression. In this study, CAFs were classified according to the presence of \u03b1-SMA protein, and their impact on lumBC was investigated in the context of this marker both in clinical samples and in\u00a0vitro. We showed for the first time that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs might stimulate growth of lumBC cancer cells by secreting OPN.We demonstrated heterogeneous expression of \u03b1-SMA in intratumoral CAFs in primary breast cancers. We found that high level of this marker in CAFs was associated with poor prognosis in patients with lumBC. Even though there are studies that link \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs with worse clinical outcome in breast cancer or specifically in TNBC subtype, we report this correlation in lumBC for the first time.\u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs could potentially influence patients\u2019 outcome by induction or regulation of more aggressive phenotype of cancer cells (characterized, e.g., by increased proliferation, stemness, or epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, EMT). In line, CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs induced the outgrowth of lumBC cell lines in\u00a0vitro in 3D cultures. However, no induction of phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, proteins involved in cell proliferation, was observed in MCF7 cell line when \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs CM was used. This could mean that another signaling pathway was involved or \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs\u2019 positive effect on cancer cell growth occurs only in 3D cultures that more accurately reflect the conditions of tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. In our cohort of patients with lumBC, significantly higher level of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and SNAIL were found in \u03b1-SMAhigh tumors. In breast cancer, EpCAM is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in the luminal and basal-like molecular subtypes. There are limited studies correlating CAFs with EpCAM, yet Eberlein et\u00a0al. demonstrated that tumor cells (non-small-cell lung cancer) with high expression of EpCAM activate CAF-like phenotype in normal fibroblasts through avb6/TGF\u03b2 signaling. Thus, potential interaction between EpCAM-positive breast cancer cells and \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs should be investigated in the future. In case of SNAIL, this transcriptional factor is essential for EMT and induces tumor cell invasion. It has been reported that SNAIL level is upregulated in tumor cells by CAFs in breast cancer. Interestingly, EpCAM could also contribute to the TGF\u2010\u03b21-induced EMT in lumBC cell line, MCF-7. Thus, in our study, elevated EpCAM and SNAIL in tumor cells of patients with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may possibly induce EMT, resulting in increased motility of those cells and giving rationale for worse clinical outcome of those patients. Nevertheless, we did not confirm induction of EMT by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs in\u00a0vitro (data not shown). CM from \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs did not induce expression of SNAIL and EpCAM in lumBC cells. Such results may be due to performing experiments in 2D culture or EMT induction by those CAFs not being dependent on secretome but rather dependent on direct contact of interacting cells.To dissect putative factors accounting for \u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-mediated induction of lumBC cell outgrowth and worse prognosis, we analyzed their transcriptome both in clinical samples and in\u00a0vitro. Gene expression revealed that genes upregulated in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (i.e., IL6, IL1B, ITGB2, ICAM1) were linked with positive regulation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity, which was previously described by our team as EMT-promoting mechanism in breast cancers. In turn, genes downregulated in \u03b1-SMAhigh isolated CAFs (e.g., CD40, TNFRSF14, TNFRSF1B, PSMB9) were implicated in tumor-necrosis-factor-mediated signaling pathway. Interestingly, only OPN was upregulated both in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs isolated from lumBC and tumor tissue samples from lumBC with \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs.OPN is a secreted, integrin-binding phosphoprotein involved in carcinogenesis. Of note, most studies report on tumor-derived OPN, and little is known about OPN secreted by CAFs. OPN secreted by tumor cells induced expression of CAF-associated markers (\u03b1-SMA and VIM) in mesenchymal stromal cells through upregulation of TGF-\u03b21. It also plays a key role in reprogramming normal mammary fibroblasts to proinflammatory, tumor-promoting CAFs. In breast cancer, elevated expression of OPN was firstly identified in stroma from patients with poor outcome and in CAFs from MMTV-PyMT breast cancer mouse model. We observed positive OPN staining in cancer cell cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly OPN was present in CAF cytoplasm and surroundings. Here we showed that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAF-derived OPN enhances tumor growth, and this process may be inhibited by OPN-neutralizing antibodies. In our clinical samples, CAF-associated OPN (i.e., OPN found in cytoplasm and/or in surrounding of CAFs) correlated also with the higher percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells, which would stay in accordance with lumBC cell outgrowth depending on \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs-derived OPN-induced tumor outgrowth. One of the previously proposed mechanisms of how stroma-derived OPN impacts cell proliferation and survival was involvement of CD44 and activation of MAPK cascade. Whether the regulation of OPN in \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs is through one of the known pathways has yet to be determined.ConclusionsWe showed that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs correlate with worse prognosis in lumBC and might be associated with more aggressive phenotype of breast cancer cells (e.g., EMT-related phenotype and/or increased proliferation). OPN secretion might be one of the mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon. However, the other mechanisms accounting for adverse impact of \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs on lumBC merit further investigation.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblasts\u03b1-SMAAlpha-smooth muscle actinlumBCLuminal breast cancerCMConditioned mediumOPNOsteopontinBCBreast cancerTMETumor microenvironmentFAPFibroblast activation proteinVIMVimentinFSP1Fibroblast-specific protein 1PDGFRPlatelet-derived growth factor receptorECMExtracellular matrixEpCAMEpithelial cell adhesion moleculePublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author contributionsConceptualization, A.M., N.B.-K., and A.J.Z.; methodology, A.M., A.N., M.P., M.N., and N.B.-K.; formal analysis, A.M., N.B.-K., and M.P.; investigation, A.M., A.N., M.P., and J.S.; resources, J.S., J.Z., A.M., and A.J.Z.; data curation, A.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.M. and N.B.-K.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.M., N.B.-K., and M.P.; visualization, A.M. and J.Sz; supervision, N.B.-K. and A.J.Z.; project administration, A.J.Z.; funding acquisition, A.J.Z.

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells.

(f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min.

(B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm).

(C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay.

In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm.

MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.

Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Correlation between CAF PD-L1 expression and postoperative RFSThe median RFS in CAF PD-L1-positive patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 59, 61, and 61\u2009months, respectively. The median RFS in CAF PD-L1-negative patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 47, 53, and 49\u2009months, respectively. CAF PD-L1 expression, evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N did not correlate with RFS (p\u2009=\u20090.058, 0.788, and 0.411, respectively).Correlation between CAF PD-L1 expression and postoperative OSKaplan\u2013Meier curves for the overall survival (OS) of patients with triple-negative breast cancer. a OS curves in cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the 73\u201310 assay. b OS curves in CAF PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the SP142 assay. c OS curves in CAF PD-L1-positive (red line) and -negative (blue line) patients evaluated using the E1L3N assayFigure\u00a05 shows the OS curves of CAF PD-L1-positive and -negative patients evaluated using 73\u201310 (Fig.\u00a05a), SP-142 (Fig. 5b), and E1L3N (Fig. 5c), respectively. The median OS of CAF PD-L1-positive patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 59, 61, and 61\u2009months, respectively.

A CAF PD-L1-positive status after evaluation with 73\u201310 significantly correlated with better OS (p\u2009=\u20090.029) in TNBC patients (Fig. 5a). However, CAF PD-L1 expression, evaluated with SP-142 or E1L3N did not correlate with OS (p\u2009=\u20090.840 and p\u2009=\u20090.309, respectively) (Fig. 5b and c).

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

Similar to site of injury, tumors through production of paracrine and endocrine signals enrolled MSCs in their microenvironment (TME) that is seen as a \"wound that never heals\". The ability of MSCs to migrate to tumors makes them potential cargo for anticancer agents. Once reached the tumors, MSCs may exert opposite roles depending on tumor types, thus supporting cancer progression, as reported in breast, melanoma, prostate and colon carcinomas or suppressing it, as in malignant glioma. The main source of MSCs in adult is bone marrow, even if additional tissues have been identified as font. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) along with fibroblasts, pericytes, adipocytes, macrophages and immune cells play a crucial role into microenvironment of breast cancers, promoting extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration and invasion, neo-angiogenesis, drug resistance and evasion of immunosurveillance. Once in TME, BM-MSCs can trans-differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) or vascular and perivascular cells switching from neutral role toward pro-tumorigenic behavior. Recently, we reported the ability of BM-MSCs to promote migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells through chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). In the last decade, different biomolecules have been found involved in BM-MSCs recruitment and activity into breast cancer including chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5); transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and interleukin 17B; CXCL10 and placental growth factor. Recently, it has been reported that platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) signaling plays an important role in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. In addition, Dhawan et al. showed that platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) along with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are involved in bone marrow support in the dissemination of breast cancer cells.Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), representing ~15% of all breast cancers, are characterized by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and ErbB2, excluding the possibility of specific intervention for these tumors. They are biologically more aggressive and have a very poor outcome compared to other breast tumors.In this study, we investigated the role of PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSC homing and activity into the highly malignant and invasive mesenchymal-like (ML) TNBC subtype. We have recently demonstrated that cells of this subtype have a strong tendency to vasculogenic mimicry (VM) both in vitro and in vivo, and that targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 interaction by an anti-EGFR aptamer, results in inhibition of VM and tumor growth in ML TNBC.To interfere with the PDGFR\u03b2-mediated cross-talk between BM-MSCs and tumor cells, we used a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer, named Gint4.T, that we have previously characterized as high specific inhibitor of the receptor in human glioblastoma. The aptamer binds at high affinity (Kd: 9.6 nmol/l) to the extracellular domain of the PDGFR\u03b2 and impedes the ligand-dependent activation of the receptor both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it has been validated in vivo for its tumor targeting efficacy, resulting neither toxic nor immunogenic.Here we show that Gint4.T aptamer inhibits the migration of BM-MSCs towards TNBC cells and their trans-differentiation into CAFs. In addition, we used in vivo cell-tracking method to monitor instantly, noninvasively and in real time the inhibitory effect of the aptamer on BM-MSC homing to breast cancer xenografts, which ultimately results in interfering with BM-MSC-dependent pro-invasive activity. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic agent that blocks either the recruitment of BM-MSCs into TME and the tumor cell-stroma interactions thus hampering TNBC aggressiveness.Materials and MethodsCell lines and culture conditionAll human breast cancer cell lines came from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. MCF-7 and U87MG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were grown in RPMI 1640.For production of MDA-MB-231 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), lentiviral constructs and infection of cells were conducted as previously described. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated on 12-well plates and infected with lentiviruses in the presence of 10% FBS and 8 \u03bcg/ml Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 48 hours of incubation, infection efficiency was determined by analyzing GFP expression by flow cytometry.To obtain conditioned medium (CM) cells were grown in medium with 1% FBS for 48 hours. The medium was then collected, centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes, and filtered through 0.22-\u03bcm filters (Millipore,Billerica, MA) before being used.The concentration of PDGF-BB in CM of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells was measured using the ELISA method as reported.Human BM-MSC isolation and cultureHuman BM-MSCs were provided by Dr. Lucarelli. Samples were taken from patients after obtaining informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute. Isolation and culture condition of human BM-MSC was performed as previously described. BM-MSCs immunophenotypic characterization was performed by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD146 (staminal positive markers) and CD34 and CD45 (staminal negative markers). The BM-MSCs were used between passages 3-5.BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes has been evaluated as reported.BM-MSCs grown in the presence of MDA-MB-231 CM for 48 hours are referred as \"BM-MSCMDA-MB 231\".RNA isolation and Real time-PCRRNA isolation and Real time-PCR was performed as previously described. Briefly, total RNA from BM-MSCs was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and equal amount of total RNA (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green reaction mixture (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and an ABI Prism 7000 (robocycler was used for amplification Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3173, indicated as pPDGFR\u03b2), rabbit monoclonal anti-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3169), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AKT (CST-9271, indicated as pAKT), rabbit polyclonal anti-AKT (CST-9272), rabbit polyclonal anti anti-phospho44/42 MAPK (CST-9101, indicated as pERK) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA); rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (A4700, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk1 (sc-93) and goat polyclonal anti-vinculin (sc-7649) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of the targeted antibody was revealed by ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Densitometric analyses were performed on at least two different expositions to assure the linearity of each acquisition using ImageJ software (v1.46r). Blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and cell invasion were performed using a 24-well Boyden chambers (Corning, NY) containing inserts of polycarbonate membranes with 8 \u03bcm pores. For migration assays, all cells tested (0.3 x 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were plated into each upper chamber in the presence of different chemoattractants (lower chamber). After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, the non-migrating cells were removed from the top chamber using a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the membrane insert were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol and counted in 10 random fields/filter at 200x magnification. Results are expressed as the percentage of migrating cells considering the untreated control sample as 100%.To perform invasion assays, the top compartment of Boyden chambers was coated with 50 \u03bcl of diluted (1:3 in PBS) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After coating, chambers were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to allow Matrigel to solidify. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (0.5 \u00d7 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were then added to each top chamber. After incubation for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, invaded cells were visualized and analyzed as described above.Analysis of BM-MSC trans-differentiation into CAFBM-MSCs and TNBC cells were co-cultured in trans-well chambers with microporous-3\u00b5m membrane (Corning, NY). To this aim, BM-MSCs (1 x 106 cells) treated or no with Gint4.T and Scr were seeded into the lower chamber in a 6-multiwell. After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (50 x 105 cells) were added to each top chamber. After 5 days at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, total RNA was extracted from BM-MSCs and analyzed for CAF markers: \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1.NIR fluorescent BM-MSC-labelingVivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent (MW: 1173 gmol-1; A: 676 nm; Em: 696 nm) was commercially obtained from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA), dissolved in 1.3 mL of warm sterile PBS (final volume of 2.0 mL). BM-MSCs (1 x 106) were re-suspended in 200 \u00b5L of sterile PBS and incubated with VivoTrack 680 (ratio 1:1, v/v) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C under agitation in the dark. Afterwards, the suspension was washed three times with PBS containing 1% FBS to remove excess cell labeling agent. At that time, VivoTrack 680-labeled cell viability was assessed microscopically by Tripan-blue exclusion (GibcoTM). To verify that the cells were successfully labelled, they were examined by flow cytometry (BD Accuri\u2122 C6), using appropriate lasers and filters for detection of 680 nm wavelength.Animal Tumor Models and treatmentAll experimental procedures complied with the European Communities Council directives (2010/63/EU) and national regulations (D.L. 116/92) and were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendations. The present study was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization number 38/2015-01-28). MDA-MB-231 cells (10 \u00d7 106) were re-suspended in 0.1 ml of 1:1 mix of physiological saline and Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into the flank of five-week-old Female Balb/c nude mice which weighed around 18-20 g (Charles River, Milan, Italy). Once tumors became palpable (established), approximately 50 mm3 [volume = 0.5 \u00d7 long diameter \u00d7 (short diameter)2], nude mice were randomized into 2 groups (3 mice for each group) for imaging studies.In order to develop a system that models the entire metastatic process, we injected MDA-MB-231/GFP cells (1\u00d7106) in presence or absence of BM-MSCs (1\u00d7106) in 150 \u00b5l of PBS Matrigel mixture (1:1, v:v) orthotopically into the mammary fat pads of severely immunocompromised NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. BM-MSCs were treated with Gint4.T (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours prior injection. Mice (3 mice for each group) were monitored for development of primary xenograft tumor with high-frequency ultrasound system (Vevo 2100 equipment; FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Sixty days post injection, mice were euthanized and tumors and organs were removed. They were either stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin for paraffin embedding/sectioning and H&E staining, or they were embedded in O.C.T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature) compound and 10 \u00b5m frozen sections were incubated with DAPI for 5 minutes to stain nuclei blue and subsequently prepared for fluorescent microscopy of GFP.In vivo tracking of BM-MSC to TNBC xenografts by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT)For FMT studies, tumor-bearing mice were maintained on a diet with a purified, alfalfa-free rodent chow for 15 days before fluorescent imaging to minimize fluorescence in the gut. VivoTrack 680 alone or BM-MSCs (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) labeled with VivoTrack 680 and treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours were administered to MDA-MB-231 xenografts by caudal vein injection. Mice under isoflurane anesthesia were analyzed at different time points by FMT 4000 imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Epifluorescence (2D) and tomography (3D) datasets were both acquired and analyzed by FMT system software (TrueQuantTM v4.0) from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA). 3D regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around tumor regions, and a threshold was applied equal to 30% of the maximum value of fluorescence in the adjoining non-tumor area. The total amount (pmoles) of fluorochrome was automatically calculated relative to internal standards generated with known concentrations of the appropriate dye. After imaging studies, mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and then harvested for FACS analysis of labeled BM-MSCs.Statistical analysisResults were obtained from at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean \u00b1SD. Statistical values were defined using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows by t-test. P value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.ResultsBM-MSCs promote TNBC cells migration and invasionTo investigate whether BM-MSCs have the ability to promote migration and invasion of ML MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells a trans-well assay was performed, in which each cancer cell line was exposed to BM-MSCs, added in the lower chamber (Figure 1A). We found that TNBC cells migrated much avidly when co-cultured with BM-MSCs for 24 hours (Figure 1B). Similarly, when TNBC cells were seeded on top compartment of trans-well coated with Matrigel a strong stimulation of their invasion was observed in the presence of BM-MSCs (Figure 1C). We also found increased expression of stem cell markers, such as Sox2 and Nanog in TNBC cells upon BM-MSCs co-culture for 5 days (Figure 1D).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits PDGFR\u03b2-mediated signaling pathway in BM-MSCsIn agreement with previous reports, we found that BM-MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 protein and mRNA (Figure 2A). Human PDGFR\u03b2-positive glioblastoma U87MG and PDGFR\u03b2-negative breast cancer MCF-7 cells were used as positive and negative control, respectively, in western blotting (left panel) and Real Time-PCR (right panel) analyses.Since several evidences show a critical role for PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSCs homing to tumor sites including malignant glioma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and colon carcinomas we wondered whether the Gint4.T RNA aptamer, that we previously validated as a specific inhibitor of PDGFR\u03b2, is able to interfere with this phenomenon. The aptamer binds to the extracellular domain of human PDGFR\u03b2 thus interfering with PDGF-BB ligand stimulation of the receptor. Firstly, we verified the aptamer ability to inhibit ligand-dependent PDGFR\u03b2 activation and downstream phosphatidyl-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways in BM-MSCs upon PDGF-BB stimulation (Figure 2B).It has been reported that inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 and downstream ERK and AKT signaling inhibited human MSC osteogenesis in vitro . Accordingly, we found that the aptamer hampered BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts but not into adipocytes (Figure S1).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSCs migration towards TNBC cellsNext, we determined whether the aptamer-mediated inhibition of intracellular signaling initiated by PDGFR\u03b2 results in impairment of BM-MSCs migration. As shown in Figure 3A, treating BM-MSCs with the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduced cell migration stimulated by serum, causing 44% inhibition as compared with the Scr aptamer. A similar effect was elicited by imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor acting on different tyrosine protein kinases including PDGFR\u03b2.MSCs have been recently described to home into breast carcinoma in response to numerous endocrine and paracrine signals. Importantly, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer caused a dramatic reduction of their migration toward PDGF-BB ligand as compared with controls treatment (Mock and Scr) (Figure 3B). Next, we analyzed the secretion of PDGF-BB in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 by ELISA. The data showed that PDGF-BB detected in BT-549 was 12,84 \u00b11.52 pg/ml whereas in MDA-MB-231 was 6.46 \u00b11,46 pg/ml. Accordingly, Gint4.T strongly inhibited BM-MSCs migration to both TNBC cell lines (Figure 3C).These results indicate that inhibiting PDGFR\u03b2 with Gint4.T hampers the homing of BM-MSCs to TNBC cell lines.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC trans-differentiation into Cancer Associated FibroblastsBecause CAFs are well known to play a key role in tumor progression and metastatic spread we wondered whether BM-MSCs when co-cultured with TNBC cells acquire the expression of CAF-specific markers. Interestingly, a significant increase of mRNA levels of \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1 was observed when BM-MSCs were exposed up to 5 days to MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, thus indicating that TNBC are able to induce BM-MSCs trans-differentiation into CAF-like cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, Gint4.T treatment strongly reduced CAF markers mRNA expression in BM-MSCs, co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B, left) and BT-549 (Figure 4B, right) compared to Scr negative control, thus suggesting the aptamer ability to prevent BM-MSC differentiation into CAFs in TNBC microenvironment. Further, in order to assess the effect of the aptamer on the pro-invasive function of CAF-like BM-MSCs, BM-MSCs were grown for 48 hours in the presence of CM from MDA-MB-231 (BM-MSCMDA-MB 231) to induce a CAF-like phenotype (Figure 4C). Next, MDA-MB-231 cells invasiveness was assessed by using CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 as chemoattractant in the transwell invasion assay. As shown (Figure 4D), CM from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 strongly increased the invasion rate of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and, importantly, Gint4.T interfered with this event.These results indicate that blocking PDGFR\u03b2 on BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer not only decreased their ability to migrate towards TNBC cells but also their capability to trans-differentiate in CAFs and to induce a pro-invasive phenotype of TNBC cells.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts as assessed by Fluorescence Molecular TomographyTo follow the homing of BM-MSCs toward TNBC in vivo, we labeled the cells with VivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent. As assessed by flow cytometry analysis, a total labeling efficiency was obtained at the experimental condition used (Figure 5A). First, we checked the absence of cell viability loss after labeling (data not shown). Then, nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts, were intravenously injected with VivoTrack 680-labeled BM-MSCs, treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer, and analyzed by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography at different time-points (Figure 5B). 3D images were reconstructed and volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated around the tumor. The fluorescence signal of BM-MSCs was visualized in the tumor at 2 hours post-injection and remained visualized up to 24 hours (Figure 5C). Because VivoTrack 680 emits at NIR wavelength where autofluorescence and tissue absorbance are minimal, a low fluorescence was observed in the tissues around the tumor. As shown, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer strongly reduced BM-MSC recruitment into MDA-MB-231 xenografts compared to the negative control (Figure 5C). Moreover, FACS analysis of NIR labeled BM-MSCs in cell suspension from tumors, revealed a significant decrease of BM-MSCs recruitment in tumors after their treatment with Gint4.T aptamer (Figure 5D), thus confirming the results of in vivo imaging. These findings prove the ability of the aptamer to inhibit tropism of BM-MSCs to TNBC targeting PDGFR\u03b2.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivoIn agreement with previous report we found that the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells is not affected when breast cancer cells were co-injected with BM-MSCs in mammary fat pad of immunocompromised mice (Figure S2). Conversely, BM-MSCs increased the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells in orthotopic model thus correlating with our in vitro findings. To investigate whether the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer has the ability to inhibit BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivo, GFP-labelled MDA-MB-231 were mixed with BM-MSCs, left untreated or prior treated with Gint4.T, and injected in mammary fat pad of mice. After 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the lungs were extracted for analysis. Although no visible macro-metastatic lesions were observed in each experimental mouse group, GFP fluorescence was evident in the lung sections demonstrating microscopic metastasis. As shown (Figure 5E), BM-MSCs induced a significant enhancement in the number of detectable multifocal metastatic lesions that was counteracted by Gint4.T treatment.DiscussionSince the tumor microenvironment contributes to many aspects of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, the different stromal cell types, which play key roles in determining or enhancing several hallmark capabilities in different TMEs, should be taken into account to stimulate future anticancer drug development. In particular, the recent discovery that MSCs can be recruited into TME and promote cancer progression has led to consider MSCs as a suitable target for anti-cancer therapy. Importantly, tumor associated-MSCs contribute to tumor cell growth and metastatic behavior in a variety of cancers, including breast, prostate, osteosarcoma and colon cancers. The high tropism of MSCs for malignant tumors is largely similar to what observed for inflamed and injured tissues and involve the same growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. Tumor cells are able to produce a chemotactic gradient consisting of different chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL12 and CXCL16, which is able to recruit MSCs.Jung et al. (2013) showed that MSCs were both recruited as well as transformed in CAFs by CXCL16 produced by prostate cancer cells. In turn, MSC-like CAFs secreted CXCL12 that binding to CXCR4 on tumor cells induced an EMT, which ultimately promoted metastasis to secondary tumor sites.Many growth factors such as PDGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), TGF-\u03b2 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been found to effectively mediate MSC homing to TME.Interestingly, several studies reported PDGF-BB as a critical mediator of MSC tropism to gliomas. It has been reported that recruitment of MSCs towards pancreatic tumors in response to PDGF, EGF and VEGF, can be inhibited by Glivec, Erbitux and Avastin, respectively. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that bFGF and downstream ERK/Smad3 signaling pathway are involved in BM-MSC tropism to 4T1 breast cancer cells by using a specific neutralizing antibody.An increasing number of evidence has shown that MSCs in primary tumors can differentiate in active components of the tumor microenvironment such as CAFs, which are known to play a key role in tumor progression, neo-angiogenesis, EMT and metastatic spread. Therefore, great interest has been shown in developing therapeutic targeting strategies aimed to inhibit MCS support thus improving therapeutic efficacy in treating cancer. Thus, in this scenario, the starting point for MSC targeted therapy is the identification of specific molecular pathways involved in pro-tumorigenic cross-talk between MSCs and cancer cells. The delineation of key molecular pathways that underlie this important interplay has improved the knowledge of the biology of TME, tumor spreading, and carcinogenesis. Over past years, several studies have shown that MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 suggesting that it could play a crucial role in processes in which MSCs are involved. In fact, it is widely reported that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in specifying MSC commitment to mesenchymal lineages as well as in MSC proliferation and self-renewal. Furthermore, PDGFR\u03b2 signaling has emerged as a predominant pathway in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. Hata et al. , for example, have demonstrated that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in MSC tropism for malignant gliomas, providing direct evidence that tumor is capable of attracting MSCs in an intracranial glioma model through PDGFR\u03b2 pathway. Furthermore, it has been reported that PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC recruitment into TME, contributed to enhance the aggressive and invasive properties of many other tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colon carcinomas. However, although PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitors have already been tested for their capability to target and interfere with receptor activity in MSCs, no studies have still demonstrated the possibility to target PDGFR\u03b2 to prevent pro-tumorigenic effect of MSCs into tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the current class of PDGFR\u03b2 drugs consists of small molecule TKIs that show limited specificity and modest efficacy whereas no antibodies have entered the clinic. This study reports, for the first time, an innovative therapeutic tool, an anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer able to prevent BM-MSC recruitment and activity into TNBC microenvironment. Recent evidences have widely shown that BM-MSCs can integrate into the tumor-associated stroma and promote the progression of TNBC through the activation of different mechanisms involving HIFs, TGF-\u03b2 and CCL5. Up to now, no work has demonstrated the involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 pathway in MSC homing toward TNBC microenvironment, as well as MSC-mediated TNBC progression. Interestingly, in this study we show that the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduces both in vitro BM-MSC migration stimulated by two different TNBC cell lines and in vivo BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts, as assessed by FMT. These results underline the importance of PDGFR\u03b2 in mediating MSC migration towards TNBC site and highlights Gint4.T aptamer to specifically prevent PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC tropism for TME. Finally, recent evidence has demonstrated that MSCs selectively proliferate in TME and trans-differentiate in pro-tumor supporting CAFs. Although the effect of MSCs on growth of breast cancer is controversial and probably depends on the experimental setting of the animal model, conversely, it is well established that MSCs have a significant impact on promoting breast cancer metastasis. Our data demonstrated that Gint4.T aptamer not only hampers PDGFR\u03b2 downstream signaling in BM-MSCs, but it also interferes with their recruitment into TNBC and with their differentiation into CAF thus preventing metastatic lung lesions (Figure 6).ConclusionsTumor microenvironment recruits MSCs from the circulation, adjacent tissues and bone-marrow thus educating these cells to adopt pro-tumorigenic phenotypes. MSCs in tumor cause a formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and can also enhance the proportions of cancer stem cells, promote EMT, and stimulate tumor angiogenesis. These effects contribute to tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Our aptamer-based approach to interrupt the cross-talk between cancer cells, MSCs and the inflammatory tumor microenvironment will likely provide new anti-cancer opportunities.Abbreviations\u03b1-SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorBM-MSCsbone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cellsCAFcarcinoma-associated fibroblastCCL5chemokine C-C motif ligand 5CLLchronic lymphocytic leukemiaCXCL10C-X-C motif chemokine 10CXCR4chemokine receptor type 4DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionERK 1/2extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2FAPfibroblast activation proteinFBSfetal bovine serumFMTFluorescence Molecular TomographyFSP-1Fibroblast-specific Protein 1MLmesenchymal-likeMSCsmesenchymal stem cellsPDGF-BBplatelet-derived growth factor BBPDGFR\u03b2platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2PI3Kphosphatidyl-3-kinaseROIsregions of interestTAMstumor-associated macrophagesTMEtumor microenvironmentTNBCtriple-negative breast cancerTGF-\u03b2transforming growth factor \u03b2VOIsvolumes of interestSupplementary MaterialInteraction of MSC with tumor cellsMesenchymal stem cells within tumour stroma promote breast cancer metastasisBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and the tumor microenvironmentMesenchymal stromal cells promote tumor growth through the enhancement of neovascularization.

        "content": "Macroautophagy/autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress response mechanism. Autophagy induction in the tumor microenvironment (stroma) has been shown to support tumor metabolism. However, cancer cell-derived secreted factors that initiate communication with surrounding cells and stimulate autophagy in the tumor microenvironment are not fully documented. We identified CTF1/CT-1 (cardiotrophin 1) as an activator of autophagy in fibroblasts and breast cancer-derived carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We showed that CTF1 stimulated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3, initiating transcriptional activation of key autophagy proteins. Additionally, following CTF1 treatment, AMPK and ULK1 activation was observed. We provided evidence that autophagy was important for CTF1-dependent ACTA2/\u03b1-SMA accumulation, stress fiber formation and fibroblast activation. Moreover, promotion of breast cancer cell migration and invasion by activated fibroblasts depended on CTF1 and autophagy. Analysis of the expression levels of CTF1 in patient-derived breast cancer samples led us to establish a correlation between CTF1 expression and autophagy in the tumor stroma. In line with our <iin vitro</i data on cancer migration and invasion, higher levels of CTF1 expression in breast tumors was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis in patients. Therefore, CTF1 is an important mediator of tumor-stroma interactions, fibroblast activation and cancer metastasis, and autophagy plays a key role in all these cancer-related events.<bAbbreviations:</b ACTA2/\u03b1-SMA: actin, alpha 2, smooth muscle CAFs: cancer- or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts CNT Ab.: control antibody CNTF: ciliary neurotrophic factor CTF1: cardiotrophin 1 CTF1 Neut.

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

        "content": "Tumor-derived matricellular proteins such as osteopontin (OPN) and tenascin-C (TN-C) have been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the molecular basis of how these proteins contribute to tumor progression remains to be elucidated. Importantly, these matricellular proteins are known to interact with \u03b19\u03b21 integrin. Therefore, we hypothesized that tumor-derived \u03b19\u03b21 integrin may contribute to tumor progression. To clarify the roles of \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis, we used an inhibitory anti-human \u03b19\u03b21 integrin antibody (anti-h\u03b19\u03b21 antibody) and a \u03b19\u03b21 integrin-positive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 luc-D3H2LN (D3H2LN), in vitro functional assays, and an in vivo orthotopic xenotransplantation model. In this study, we demonstrated that tumor, but not host \u03b19\u03b21 integrin, contributes to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and host-derived OPN production. We also found that CAFs contributed to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, and host-derived OPN levels. Consistent with those findings, tumor volume was well-correlated with numbers of CAFs and levels of host-derived OPN. Furthermore, it was shown that the inoculation of D3H2LN cells into mammary fat pads with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), obtained from wild type, but not OPN knock-out mice, resulted in enhancement of tumor growth, thus indicating that CAF-derived OPN enhanced tumor growth. These results suggested that tumor \u03b19\u03b21-mediated signaling plays a pivotal role in generating unique primary tumor tissue microenvironments, which favor lymphatic metastasis and tumor growth. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes lymphatic metastasis through enhancing invasion. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes tumor growth through CAFs.

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

        "content": "Tumor growth and local invasion are greatly dependent on the malignant potential of a tumor cell, but are also significantly modulated by a variety of local factors. These factors comprise cytokines, growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), which act through a complex system of auto-, para- and juxtacrine interactions. Some factors are produced by the malignant cell itself, others are expressed by adjacent tumor stroma, migrated inflammatory cells, or resident macrophages. We have investigated the influences of cytokines and growth factors known to be expressed by tumor stroma on the cytokine expression pattern of three human breast cancer cell lines of different malignant potential. MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 were incubated with human recombinant TNF-alpha, IGF-I, IGF-II, bFGF, HGF or G-CSF and the pattern of tumor-cell-derived TGF-beta1, bFGF, IL-1alpha and VEGF was analyzed. Among the three cell lines used we observed a heterogenous response to stromal cytokines by measuring above mentioned factors in the cell culture's supernatants, but no clear correlation between malignant potential and cytokine expression pattern seemed obvious. We hypothesize that local growth factors may have a significant modulatory effect on malignant behavior in vivo. We conclude that this effect might depend on individual responses and on the differentiation state of tumor cells.",

        "content": "Tumor metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have tropism towards tumor tissues, and can be converted into tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cells (TA-MSCs) to facilitate TNBC metastasis through interactions with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and unclear, and effective strategies to suppress tumor metastasis via eliminating TA-MSCs are still lacking.

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 7The patients with TNBC had two kinds of \u03b1-SMA expression: high and low (Fig. 6A). Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature.

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered to contribute to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the cell type of origin remains unknown. Since human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) are locally adjacent to breast cancer cells and might directly interact with tumor cells, we investigated whether CAFs may originate from hASCs. hASCs cultured under different conditions were quantified for the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin. ELISA was performed using the human TGF\u03b21, SDF-1\u03b1 and CCL5 Quantikine Kit. The invasion potential of MDAMB231 cancer cells was evaluated using a Boyden chamber with filter inserts coated with Matrigel in 24-well dishes. We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g. expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Our data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion.",

IntroductionBreast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. This disease is separated into distinct subtypes defined by the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) within the tumor. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks expression of all three receptors and is distinguished by aggressive growth and poor prognosis. Moreover, there are no approved targeted therapies for TNBC, and chemotherapy remains the standard of care. While TNBC can be sensitive to chemotherapy, approximately 40% of TNBC patients will have a recurrence after initial treatment that is significantly more likely to occur within the first three years and is associated with reduced survival. Therefore, TNBC patients often develop visceral metastases sooner than the other subtypes, and median survival rarely exceeds 12 months after metastasis, highlighting the need to find novel targets for therapeutic interventions. Molecular characterization of TNBC has identified a characteristic and reliable pattern of gene expression, despite a high level of heterogeneity. However, there is a paucity of known driver mutations (aside from P53 mutations) that has made it difficult to develop effective targeted therapies. This suggests that mutations or epigenetic alterations that lie outside of protein-coding regions, possibly within regulatory elements contained in the non-coding regions of the genome, are contributing to the TNBC phenotype.Enhancers are often found in both inter- and intragenic regions of the genome and are characterized by their ability to drive spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression. Enhancers are commonly defined as regions of DNA that increase the expression of target genes in a distance and orientation-independent manner. Though enhancers are a key component of healthy development and gene regulation, mounting evidence suggests that enhancers can be rewired or hijacked by cancer cells for the activation of genes that promote tumor formation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. This is especially true for cancers that have few or no known driver mutations within protein coding genes, such as TNBC. Enhancers are marked by an enrichment of transcription factor binding, open chromatin accessibility, and distinctive histone modifications on flanking nucleosomes. Histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) is a reliable marker for enhancers, though it does not differentiate between the active or poised state. The addition of Histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), however, is associated with active enhancers which have been shown to form chromatin loops that bring the target promoter and enhancer into close spatial proximity for physical interaction. This interplay is thought to be essential for enhancer function, though the specific requirements for the formation and purpose of the chromatin loop is not well defined at all loci. These features and combinations thereof have enabled researchers to annotate novel enhancers that drive critical gene expression pathways and has resulted in considerable evidence demonstrating that enhancers are frequently repurposed as part of oncogenesis, particularly through the upregulation of proliferation genes to confer a growth advantage. Therefore, enhancers represent an area of cancer research that could significantly impact the diagnosis and treatment of TNBC and will likely be extensible to other forms of cancer.One of the most significant discoveries for elucidating enhancer function has been the transcription of non-coding RNAs from active enhancers (eRNAs). This unexpected revelation altered our understanding of enhancer mechanisms, and though we still have limited knowledge regarding the purpose of eRNA production, key studies have suggested that eRNAs are vital to enhancer function. Studies have found that the majority of enhancers can transcribe eRNAs either uni- or bidirectionally, these transcripts average 2\u20135 kb, and most lack polyadenylation leading to a high turnover rate. Of note, previous reports have demonstrated that eRNA production by RNA polymerase II temporally precedes the activation of target gene promoters. Whether the act of transcription or the eRNA transcripts themselves are most important for enhancer function has been heavily debated; however, growing evidence suggests that eRNAs may act in cis to support the function of their associated enhancers through a variety of potential roles. The most likely mechanisms of function are through transcription factor binding, chromatin loop stabilization, or serving as a decoy for transcriptional repressors. Regardless of the mechanisms employed, the expression of eRNAs highly correlates with the formation of enhancer-promoter loops and many additional features of active enhancers. Therefore, enhancer transcription represents the most reliable indicator of enhancer activity and can accurately predict novel functional regulatory regions.In this study, we sought to describe novel enhancers that might contribute to the pathogenicity of TNBC and could improve our understanding of disease progression. We leveraged eRNA transcription and hallmark chromatin modifications measured in breast cancer cell lines to identify an eRNA-producing enhancer that is uniquely active in the TNBC subtype. We then employed an integrated set of CRISPR-based techniques to identify the target genes of this enhancer and couple these results with biological assays to determine its significance in the context of the disease. We use novel Cas13 RNA-guided RNA-degradation approaches to demonstrate that the eRNA transcripts themselves are required for the regulation of the target genes, suggesting a post-transcriptional role in enhancer function. Finally, we extend our findings beyond breast cancer by demonstrating that enhancer transcription and eRNA transcripts are necessary for CSF1 enhancer function in ovarian cancer. Our results propose that this mechanism is extensible to other eRNA-producing enhancers and can be significant to other cancer types.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell CultureAll cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were maintained and used for experiments in the Franco lab at UNC Chapel Hill. MDA-MB-436 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma cat. #30-2002) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Corning). Media for dCas9-KRAB expressing cell lines and PspCas13b expressing cell lines were supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/mL blasticidin (Corning, 30100RB) for maintenance after selection. RfxCas13d expressing cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 0.1 \u00b5g/mL puromycin (Sigma, P9620) after selection. Cell lines expressing both dCas9-KRAB and multiplexed sgRNAs were grown in DMEM supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/mL blasticidin and 0.1 \u00b5g/mL puromycin after selection. All other breast cancer subtype cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MCF10A cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies Inc. cat #11330032) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Life Technologies Inc. cat #16050122), 10 \u00b5g/mL insulin, 0.5 \u00b5g/mL hydrocortisone, 20 ng/mL recombinant EGF (Lonza cat#: CC-4136), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown as adherent cultures at 37 \u00b0C and with 5% CO2. Low passage cell stocks were kept frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed for use. Before use, cells were authenticated with Short Tandem Repeat profiling through ATCC. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma.2.2. Global Run-On Sequencing (GRO-Seq) and ChIP-SeqGRO-seq data and eRNA annotations were downloaded from NCBI\u2019s Gene Expression Omnibus repository under the following accession number GSE96859 (GRO-seq). Enhancer annotations across all breast cancer subtypes and ChIP-seq data were downloaded from GEO under the following accession GSE85158. These data were used to rank TNBC-specific enhancers on the basis of H3K27ac enrichment and eRNA expression. Candidate TNBC-specific enhancers were then visualized using the UCSC Genome Browser () and the enrichment of H3K27ac and eRNA production was compared across all breast cancer subtypes. Ovarian cancer H3K27ac ChIP-seq data were downloaded from the SRA database using accession number GSE101408. Ovarian cancer BRD4 ChIP-seq data were downloaded from the SRA database using accession number GSE77568. Browser tracks were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer.2.3. RT-PCR of Patient TumorsDe-identified snap-frozen human TNBC tumor specimens were obtained through the UNC Tissue Procurement Core Facility (IRB Protocol 18-3330). RNA was extracted from tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74106) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA quality was verified using the Agilent RNA TapeStation. Genomic DNA was removed with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Invitrogen, AM1907) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and 1\u20132 \u03bcg of purified RNA was synthesized into cDNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, M1705) with random primers to facilitate eRNA detection. RT-PCR was performed using 5\u201380 ng of template cDNA with Taq DNA polymerase (NEB, M0267S) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Amplification was performed with the following program: 1 cycle at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min, 30\u201340 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C or 62 \u00b0C for 1 min, then held at 10 \u00b0C. Primers for eRNA amplification can be found in Table S1. Variations in RT-PCR template amount, annealing temperature, and cycle number were experimentally determined to be optimal for either robustly produced transcripts or low abundance eRNAs.2.4. Quantitative RT-PCRRNA extracted from cells was further treated to remove genomic DNA using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Invitrogen, AM1907) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using 1\u20132 \u00b5g of RNA and the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, M1705) with random primers to allow for eRNA detection. The resulting cDNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR with SYBR Green using the QuantStudio 6 Flex System (Applied Biosystems) and the primers listed in Table S1. mRNA and eRNA expression were normalized to GAPDH and/or ACTB and fold change compared to a negative control was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT (Livak) method. All experiments were conducted at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Results are shown as the mean fold change \u00b1 standard error of the mean (S.E.M). Statistical analysis was performed in the R environment () using a Student\u2019s two-sample t-test. Statistical significance is indicated by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.005, and *** p < 0.0005. Primer oligonucleotide sequences can be found in Table S1.2.5. Expression of CSF1 across Breast Cancer or All TCGA Cancer TypesTo determine the expression of CSF1 mRNA across a broad patient tumor dataset, we used the METABRIC breast cancer dataset via cBioPortal (). In total, 1,904 samples were grouped based on clinical BC subtype and plotted to display CSF1 mRNA expression z-scores relative to all samples (log microarray), showing that claudin-low TNBC tumors had the highest expression of CSF1 mRNA. All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance is indicated by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.005, and *** p < 0.0005. CSF1 expression across all cancer subtypes was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA Research Network: ) dataset to examine 10,071 patient samples. Samples were grouped based on cancer type to observe CSF1 expression in RSEM (RNA-Seq by Expectation Maximization). Groups were arranged based on median value in descending order.2.6. TCGA Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with High-Throughput Sequencing (ATAC-Seq) Data AnalysisATAC-seq data for this analysis were downloaded from the TCGA repository Firebrowse (). TCGA patient barcodes were used to subset down to breast cancer only and then grouped based on PAM50 subtype classification. Bedtools intersect (one bp overlap) was used to identify ATAC peaks overlapping the CSF1 enhancer or transcription start site (TSS) and the mean of the ATAC scores for each region were calculated to represent chromatin accessibility. Statistical analysis was performed with a two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test.2.7. CSF1 Enhancer Knockout with CRISPR-Cas9Targeted deletion of the CSF1 enhancer was accomplished using the CRISPR-Cas9 system following published protocols. Briefly, guide RNA target sites flanking the outer boundaries of the eRNA transcripts were designed using the CRISPOR web tool. Genomic coordinates for the CSF1 enhancer, sgRNA sequences, and genotyping PCR primer sequences can be found in Table S1. Guide RNA oligos were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, annealed, and cloned into pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 (Addgene Plasmid #62988). To ensure deletion of the enhancer region, two sgRNAs (one 5\u2032 and one 3\u2032 of the eRNA peaks) were transfected into MDA-MB-436 or MDA-MB-468 cells using the Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Promega, E2691) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. CRISPR-Cas9 positive clones were identified through puromycin selection that began 3 days post-transfection and lasted a total of 7\u201310 days. To confirm the enhancer deletion, individual positive clones were picked and expanded into separate wells and genotyped via PCR using primers flanking the deletion site (to identify deletion alleles) or primers internal to the enhancer (to identify wild type alleles). Successful CSF1 enhancer deletion resulted in a ~1510\u20132100 bp deletion and correct knockout cell lines were further analyzed by Sanger DNA sequencing to determine the precise boundaries of the deletion.2.8. Cell Proliferation AssaysCells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde on days 2, 4, and 6 after seeding and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol. Cells were destained with 10% glacial acetic acid, then destain was transferred to a 96-well plate and read at an absorbance of 595 nm to identify differences in cell proliferation rates across the timepoints. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student\u2019s two sample t-test.2.9. Cell Migration AssaysCells suspended in serum-free DMEM media containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin were plated in a PET cell culture insert (Fisher, 353097) and placed in a Falcon 24 well companion plate (Fisher, 353504) at a density of 150,000 cells/well in a 100 \u00b5L volume. The lower chamber beneath the membrane was filled with 500 \u00b5L of DMEM media containing 1% P/S and 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 48 h the cells were fixed and stained using the Hema 3 kit (Fisher, 122-911). Ten brightfield images were taken of each membrane per replicate and were brightened to increase the contrast between stained cells and membrane background. Image color was inverted using ImageJ (1.53 K) and then uploaded into cell profiler (version 4.2.1) and analyzed with a cell counting pipeline that counted stained cells based on size and signal intensity. Counted migrated cells were averaged per replicate and statistical analysis was performed using a Student\u2019s two sample t-test.2.10. Colony Formation AssayCells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 450 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown for ~20 days to allow for colony formation and then fixed with 10% formaldehyde. Colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol and allowed to dry. Images were taken of each well, and colonies were counted using ImageJ with a consistent set of criteria applied to each well. Threshold values of 20 and 170 were applied to each well to highlight colonies and counting was performed using particle analysis set to ignore any colonies smaller than 200 pixels. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student\u2019s two sample t-test.2.11. Engineering MDA-MB-436 and OVCAR3 dCas9-KRAB Expressing CellsLentivirus containing the Lenti-dCas9-KRAB-blast vector (Addgene #89567) was packaged in HEK-293T cells. HEK-293T cells were seeded in a T75 flask and transfected with the following plasmids: 6.67 \u00b5g Lenti-dCas9-KRAB-blast, 5 \u00b5g psPAX2 (Addgene #12260), and 3.33 \u00b5g PMD2G (Addgene #12259) using Fugene 6 (Promega, E2691) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The lentivirus-containing supernatant was harvested 48- and 72-h post-transfection, and lentivirus was concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara, 631231) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Low passage MDA-MB-436 or OVCAR3 cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates at ~50,000 cells/well and independently transduced with harvested lentivirus in DMEM media with 10% FBS and 10 \u00b5g/mL polybrene (Millipore, TR1003G). Transduced cells were incubated with lentivirus for 72 h, then placed in DMEM selection media with 5 \u00b5g/mL blasticidin for 7 days. Batch-selected dCas9-KRAB cells were verified by Western blot. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed using the following lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor. The primary antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows: Anti-beta Tubulin Loading Control (Abcam, ab6046), Anti-Cas9 Antibody (7A9-3A3) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-517386). \u03b2-tubulin antibody was used at a 1:1500 dilution in 5% BSA in TBST with overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C. The Cas9 antibody was used at a 1:1500 dilution in 5% BSA in TBST with overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C. The secondary antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows: Donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Whole Ab, HRP-conjugated (GE Healthcare, NA934) and Donkey anti-Mouse IgG (H+L), and HRP-conjugated (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA1-28748). Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:5000 dilution in 5% BSA in TBST. Original uncropped Western blots shown in Figure S3.2.12. CRISPRi sgRNA Design and Vector CloningsgRNAs targeting the CSF1 enhancer or transcription start site were designed using the CRISPOR web tool. Several sgRNAs targeting unique regions of the enhancer or TSS were designed to be transfected together (Table S1). A previously published non-targeting scrambled sgRNA was used as a negative control. The sgRNA cloning vector, pX-sgRNA-eGFP-MI, is a modified version of pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro (pX459) v2.0 (Addgene #62988). Cas9 was removed from pX459 and replaced with eGFP to enable visualization of sgRNA expression. To improve sgRNA stability and optimize for assembly with dCas9, the sgRNA stem-loop was extended and modified with an A-U base pair flip. sgRNA vector cloning was performed following the protocol from Feng Zheng\u2019s group. Briefly, sgRNA oligonucleotides ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) were duplexed with the following reaction: 10 \u00b5M sgRNA forward oligo, 10 \u00b5M sgRNA reverse oligo, 10 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, M0201L), and 1\u00d7 T4 ligation buffer under the following conditions: 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, then ramp down to 25 \u00b0C at 5 \u00b0C/min. Duplexed sgRNAs were diluted 1:100 and 2 \u00b5L of this dilution was used in a ligation reaction with 100 ng pX-sgRNA-eGFP-MI linearized with BbsI-HF (NEB, R3539S). The ligation product was transformed into Subcloning Efficiency DH5alpha Competent Cells (Invitrogen, 18265017) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Each completed sgRNA vector was verified by Sanger sequencing using a human U6 promoter sequencing primer. This primer and the sgRNA oligonucleotide sequences can be found in Supplementary Materials\u00a0Table S1.2.13. CRISPR Interference (CRISPRi) Targeted PerturbationCell lines that stably express sgRNAs were created using a lentiviral multiplexed vector that was a gift from Anna Chiarella in the Hathaway lab at UNC Chapel Hill. This vector allows for stable expression of several sgRNAs at once under the control of the human U6 promoter. Lentiviral vectors were cloned to either contain a single non-targeting scrambled sgRNA or a combination of four sgRNAs all targeting the CSF1 enhancer. Lentivirus was created and collected following the same protocol used for engineering dCas9-KRAB expressing cells described above. Low passage MDA-MB-436-dCas9-KRAB cell lines were seeded in 6-well plates at ~50,000 cells/well and independently transduced with harvested lentivirus in DMEM media with 10% FBS and 10 \u00b5g/mL polybrene (Millipore, TR1003G). Transduced cells were incubated with lentivirus for 72 h, then placed in DMEM selection media with 1 \u00b5g/mL puromycin for 15 days. Batch-selected MDA-MB-436-dCas9-KRAB-sgRNA cells were screened for multiplexed sgRNA vector insertion via genotyping PCR (Supplementary Materials\u00a0Table S1).OVCAR3 dCas9-KRAB interference transient transfection experiments were performed following published protocols with modifications. dCas9-KRAB expressing cells were seeded 1 day prior to transfection in 6-well plates at 200,000 cells/well in antibiotic-free DMEM. Cells were transfected with 1.5 \u00b5g sgRNA vector per well using Fugene 6 at a 2:1 Fugene:DNA ratio (Promega, E2691) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. A single scrambled sgRNA vector was used as a negative control. A combination of 2\u20134 targeting sgRNA plasmids were co-transfected (in equal ratio) per well and visualized for GFP expression. MCF7 dCas9-KRAB transient transfection experiments were performed as described above, except dCas9-KRAB expression vector was pooled with the sgRNAs during transfection as the MCF7 cells did not stably express dCas9-KRAB. RNA was extracted from cells 48\u201372 h post-transfection by washing with 1\u00d7 PBS and processing with the Zymo Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo, R1055) and on-column DNaseI treatment. RNA was further treated for genomic DNA removal using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Invitrogen, AM1907). All experiments were performed three or more times to ensure reproducibility and statistical fidelity.2.14. RNA-Sequencing and AnalysisRNA was collected from MDA-MB-436-dCas9-KRAB cells subjected to CRISPRi targeting as described above. RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing was performed by the Novogene Company (novogene.com). Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq mRNA-seq kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and were sequenced by paired-end 150 bp sequencing on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. RNA-sequencing was aligned to the hg38 genome using STAR 2.7.6a and quantified with Salmon 1.4.0. All samples were evaluated to ensure sequencing passed acceptable quality thresholds for analysis by utilizing the Picard 2.22.4 CollectRnaSeqMetrics function and FastQC. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package in R. Differentially expressed genes were defined as any gene with an adjusted p-value < 0.1 and a mean expression >20 (DESeq2 mean of normalized counts for all samples). RNA-seq data were uploaded to GEO under the following accession number GSE185318.2.15. Kaplan Meier Survival Analyses in Breast Cancer and Ovarian CancerBreast cancer Kaplan\u2013Meier curves were created in the R environment (packages rms and survival) using the METABRIC RNA expression and survival datasets (overall survival) subset to only contain breast cancer patients. Patients were separated into two groups of high or low gene expression using a median-centered cutoff. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model and P values were determined with a log-rank test. All statistical tests were two-sided and the significance level was set to p < 0.05. Ovarian cancer KM curves were generated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier Plotter web tool (). CSF1 (209716_at) was selected as the Affy id/gene symbol and only JetSet best probe set were used to examine 1435 patients. All other options were set at default.2.16. Engineering PspCas13b Stable Expression Cell LinesThe pC0046-EF1a-PspCas13b-NES-HIV (Addgene #103862) was modified to enable Cas13b endonuclease activity within the nucleus for specific eRNA transcript targeting. This was accomplished by removing the HIV nuclear export signal (NES) and replacing it with the SV40 nuclear localization sequence (NLS). A nucleoplasmin NLS was also inserted immediately upstream of the Cas13b coding sequence. Finally, a T2A self-cleaving peptide and Blasticidin resistance cassette was inserted for the selection of positive clones and the 3\u00d7 HA tags were conserved. This resulted in the Lenti-PspCas13b-NLS-HA-Blast vector for eRNA degradation. Stable Cas13b expression cells were created for MDA-MB-436 and OVCAR3 cells following the same methods as described in the engineering dCas9-KRAB cells section. The primary antibody for Western blot was anti-HA tag (Sigma, SAB4300603).2.17. PspCas13b eRNA Knockdown TransfectionsGuide RNA sequences were designed using an online Cas13 design tool () and were cloned into pC0043-PspCas13b crRNA backbone (Addgene #103854) following the methods previously described (Table S1). Cells stably expressing Cas13b were seeded in 6-well plates at 350,000 cells/well (MDA-MB-436) or 200,000 cells/well (OVCAR3) in antibiotic-free media 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 1.5 \u00b5g sgRNA vector per well using Fugene 6 (Promega, E2691) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. A scrambled sgRNA vector was used as a negative control. A combination of 2\u20134 targeting sgRNA plasmids were co-transfected (in equal ratio) per well. RNA was extracted from cells 24 h post-transfection by washing with 1\u00d7 PBS and processing with the Zymo Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo, R1055) and on-column DNaseI treatment. RNA was further treated for genomic DNA removal using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Invitrogen, AM1907). All experiments were performed three or more times to ensure reproducibility and statistical fidelity.2.18. Engineering RfxCas13d Stable Expression Cell LinesThe pLentiRNACRISPR_005-hU6-DR_BsmBI-EFS-RfxCas13d-NLS-2A-Puro-WPRE vector (Addgene #138147) was cloned to contain either a non-targeting scrambled sgRNA (negative control) or an sgRNA targeting the CSF1 eRNA (positive strand) following the previously described methods (Supplementary Materials\u00a0Table S1). Guide RNA sequences were designed using an online Cas13 design tool (). Stable expression cell lines were created using these vectors and following the same methods as described in the engineering dCas9-KRAB cells section. Transduced cells were batch selected using DMEM with 0.5% puromycin and positive cell lines were confirmed using genotyping PCR with primers specific to RfxCas13d (Table S1).2.19. RNA Interference (RNAi)Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 350,000 cells per well in antibiotic-free DMEM media. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 40 nM of siRNA (IDT DsiRNA) using 3 \u00b5L RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, 13778075) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 48 h, wells were washed with 1\u00d7 PBS, and RNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo, R1055) with on-column DNaseI treatment. RNA was further treated for genomic DNA removal using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Invitrogen, AM1907). Experiments were performed three or more times to ensure reproducibility and statistical fidelity. siRNA sequences can be found in Supplementary Materials\u00a0Table S1.2.20. Apoptosis Assay of MDA-MB-436 CSF1 Enhancer Knockout CellsApoptotic cells were identified by Annexin V-Alexa Fluor and Propidium iodide (PI) staining using the Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific cat #V13241) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with minor modification. Briefly, MDA-MB-436 CSF1 enhancer knockout and wildtype cells were collected and washed with 1\u00d7 PBS. Cells were counted and aliquoted to contain 100,000 cells in a 100 \u00b5L volume. Aliquots were stained with 5 \u00b5L Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 annexin V and 1 \u00b5L 100 \u00b5g/mL PI. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min before adding 400 \u00b5L 1\u00d7 annexin-binding buffer and mixing gently. Cells were kept on ice until they could be analyzed by flow cytometry measuring the fluorescence emission at 530 nm and >575 nm.3. Results3.1. Enhancer RNA Production Highlights a Novel Enhancer of CSF1 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)Enhancer activity and eRNA production are highly cell-type-specific. We and others have shown that actively transcribed enhancers are more likely to associate with enhancer-related chromatin modifications (such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac), loop to target gene promoters, and correlate with target gene activation. Thus, enhancer transcription is a good predictor of active enhancers and can be used in the absence of other genomic information to predict active enhancers de novo. To this end, we mined existing Global Run-On coupled sequencing (GRO-seq) and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) data across 13 different breast cancer cells lines to identify TNBC-specific eRNA transcription. We reasoned that using signatures of enhancer transcription would allow us to identify active enhancers that are breast cancer subtype-specific and potentially drive the expression of cancer-relevant genes. One of the most highly expressed eRNAs in TNBC cells is located ~30 kb upstream of the Colony Stimulating Factor 1 gene (CSF1) and shows strong enrichment of H3K27ac, supporting its designation as an active enhancer region (Figure 1A). While H3K27ac signal is present in other breast cancer subtypes at this site, we found that eRNA transcription is specific to TNBC cells and correlates with increased expression of its nearest neighboring gene, CSF1 (Figure 1A). This is in agreement with recent literature suggesting that eRNA production is a robust indicator of enhancer activity and is likely more reliable than the presence of H3K27ac alone. The putative target gene for this enhancer, CSF1, encodes a growth factor that regulates proliferation and differentiation of the monocytes-macrophage lineage through binding its receptor, a cell-surface tyrosine kinase called CSF1R. In breast cancer, CSF1 stimulates tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that contribute to tumor initiation and progression by promoting angiogenesis, extracellular matrix breakdown, and tumor cell motility. Moreover, CSF1 (and CSF1R) expression has been shown to correlate with progression and clinical outcome in breast cancer, making this enhancer an interesting candidate for further study.We next sought to confirm our GRO-seq analysis using qRT-PCR across the breast cancer cell lines. We chose representative cells from each subtype and combined them into groups based on their classification as normal immortalized epithelial cell lines (MCF10A), non-TNBC cell lines (MCF7, HCC1954, and UACC812), or TNBC-specific cell lines (MDA-MB-436 and HCC1937). Our results confirmed that we could detect significantly more CSF1 mRNA and eRNA in the TNBC cell lines when compared to normal or non-TNBC (Figure 1C,D). To determine if these transcripts could also be detected in human tumors, we procured nine samples collected from TNBC patients and six from non-TNBC patients for analysis of CSF1 expression. We performed reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) with primers specific to either eRNA or mRNA transcripts, demonstrating that both could be detected in human tumors (Figure 1B). However, variations in RNA quality, time of storage for samples, and the quality of each tumor specimen obtained made it challenging to quantitatively measure the differences in eRNA expression levels across this small sample size of human tumors. Instead, we leveraged much larger datasets to examine the quantitative changes in the expression of CSF1 mRNA across BC patients. We found that CSF1 is most highly expressed in TNBC Claudin-low patients and is significantly higher than the next highest subtype, Luminal A (p-value = 9.436 \u00d7 10\u22126, Welch two sample t-test) (Figure 1E). To determine if the activity of the enhancer might be contributing to the increased CSF1 expression in TNBC tumors, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ATAC-seq data to compare the chromatin accessibility landscape of this enhancer across 133 breast cancer samples. Patients were separated into groups based on BC subtype (PAM50 classification), and accessibility scores were calculated based on the mean ATAC-seq score for the five bins overlapping the enhancer region. We found that the CSF1 enhancer is significantly more accessible in TNBC patients as compared to the HER2, LumA, and LumB groups (p-values of 2.25 \u00d7 10\u22129, 3.02 \u00d7 10\u22127, and 8.59 \u00d7 10\u221210, respectively) (Figure 1F). This demonstrates that enhancer accessibility, which is required for enhancer function, is greater in the TNBC group. Interestingly, the CSF1 mRNA transcription start site (TSS) showed similar chromatin accessibility in the TNBC group compared to LumA and LumB groups and while exhibiting more accessibility compared to the HER2 group (p-values of 2.28 \u00d7 10\u22123, 0.23, and 0.46, respectively). This suggests that the CSF1 mRNA promoter is viable in all subtypes and the enhancer may be responsible for amplifying the expression in TNBC patients (Figure 1G). Taken together, these results suggest that a novel regulatory element ~30 kb upstream of the CSF1 gene is more highly transcribed in triple-negative breast cancer patients and is associated with increased expression of CSF1 mRNA.3.2. Deletion of the CSF1 Enhancer Reduces CSF1 mRNA and Leads to Growth Defects in TNBC CellsTo determine if this eRNA-producing enhancer is a bona fide enhancer of CSF1, we employed a CRISPR-Cas9 approach to knockout the genomic region containing the enhancer in the TNBC claudin-low cell line, MDA-MB-436. This cell line was chosen because CSF1 expression is highest in this cell line as determined by GRO-seq (Figure 1A); it is also highest in claudin-low TNBC patients (Figure 1E). A combination of four single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to deliver Cas9 to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking regions of the enhancer (two sgRNAs per flank), resulting in a ~2100 bp deletion that removed the entirety of the transcribed enhancer (Figure 2A). The resulting CSF1 enhancer knockout (CSF1e-KO) clones were individually genotyped for the presence of a deletion allele and/or WT allele (Figure 2B). No clones were found to be homozygous for deletion of the CSF1 enhancer, which we suspect may have been lethal to the cells; however, several heterozygous deletion clones were identified, and two (CSF1e-KO1 and CSF1e-KO2) were selected for further investigation (Figure 2B). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the changes in CSF1 eRNA and mRNA expression in wild type vs. CSF1e-KO cells. We found that the deletion of at least one CSF1 enhancer allele led to a significant reduction in both positive and negative strand eRNA transcription (Figure 2C). This also resulted in a significant decrease in CSF1 mRNA, suggesting that this region is acting to amplify expression of the CSF1 gene. To confirm these results in an independent cell line, we generated CSF1 enhancer knockouts in the MDA-MB-468 TNBC basal cell line with the same sgRNAs. Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed the results observed in the MDA-MB-436 cell line by showing a comparable decrease in CSF1 mRNA expression when the enhancer was deleted (Supplementary Materials\u00a0Figure S1A). To examine if the enhancer is providing growth or migration advantages to TNBC cells, the CSF1e-KO cell lines were assayed for changes in biological phenotypes. Measuring the proliferation potential of CSF1e-KO cells compared to WT over a 6-day time course showed a significant reduction in growth associated with the deletion of the enhancer (Figure 2D). We next explored if enhancer loss could have an impact on cancer cell motility. Transwell migration assays using only fetal bovine serum as a chemoattractant displayed a significant decrease in cell movement when comparing CSF1e-KO to WT (Figure 2E). Finally, we investigated whether the CSF1 enhancer could be providing cells with a growth advantage by promoting survival and expansion of single cells into larger colonies. To address this, we employed a colony formation or clonogenic assay and found that enhancer deletion correlated with a significant reduction in colony-forming potential compared to WT TNBC cells (Figure 2F). To determine if these observations could be the result of cell death induced by enhancer knockout, we performed an apoptosis assay using propidium iodide and Annexin V-Alexa Fluor staining combined with flow cytometry. This experiment revealed a small increase in early apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/PI\u2212) and dead cells (Annexin V+/PI+) but does not show enough change to explain the phenotype changes observed in previous assays (Supplementary Materials\u00a0Figure S1B\u2013D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that this regulatory element is a true enhancer of the CSF1 gene and that CSF1 overexpression could be contributing to the aggressive growth characteristics observed in TNBC cells.3.3. Expression and Accessibility of the CSF1 Enhancer Is Critical for Its ActivityEnhancer transcription is a hallmark of activity. To test whether transcription of the CSF1 enhancer is critical for its function in TNBC cells, we employed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) approach to epigenetically repress the enhancer region while leaving the genomic DNA intact. This technique relies on a catalytically deactivated version of Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the KRAB repressor domain that can be targeted to specific genomic loci using a complementary guide RNA (sgRNA). Once bound to a specific genomic locus, the KRAB domain mediates the recruitment of TRIM28 (tripartite motif-containing protein 28), serving as a scaffold for the binding of other repressive factors. Heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression are facilitated through the ensuing binding of SETDB1 (SET domain bifurcated 1), the NuRD complex, and HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) that coordinate to remove histone acetylation, establish H3K9me3, and promote DNA methylation resulting in robust epigenetic silencing of the local chromatin environment. For this experiment, we created two independent cell lines that stably express dCas9-KRAB and four guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that specifically target dCas9-KRAB to the CSF1 enhancer (sgCSF1e-A and sgCSF1e-B) (Figure 3A). As a negative control, we created an additional cell line that stably expresses dCas9-KRAB and a non-targeting scrambled sequence guide RNA. As quality control, the expression of dCas9-KRAB was confirmed via Western blot (Figure 3B), and the expression of the appropriate guide RNAs was confirmed via genotyping PCR (Figure 3C). Genotyping primers were designed to amplify a region of the multiplexed sgRNA vector immediately 5\u2032 to the repetitive sgRNA insertion sites. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to assess changes in eRNA and mRNA expression between scrambled sgRNA cells and CSF1e CRISPRi cells. We found that epigenetic perturbation of the CSF1 enhancer led to a significant decrease in both eRNA transcripts (positive and negative strand), which was accompanied by a reproducible decrease in CSF1 mRNA transcript (Figure 3D). This result indicates that the transcription and accessibility of the enhancer is required for the upregulation of the CSF1 mRNA, demonstrating that epigenetic disruption of this loci is sufficient to inhibit CSF1 transcription. To confirm that this enhancer activity is specific to the TNBC subtype, CRISPRi perturbation of the CSF1 enhancer was also performed on MCF7 (Luminal A) cells using identical sgRNAs. We found no significant change in either CSF1 mRNA or eRNA expression when the enhancer was targeted with dCas9-KRAB in MCF7 cells, suggesting that the enhancer is not active in these cells (Supplementary Materials Figure S2A,B).To empirically determine all of the potential target genes of the CSF1 enhancer, CRISPRi perturbation was combined with RNA-seq to examine genome-wide expression changes after CSF1 enhancer silencing. As a comparison to the enhancer targeting experiments, we also designed sgRNAs to specifically target the CSF1 mRNA at the transcription start site (TSS). This enabled us to highlight downstream changes associated with a reduction in CSF1 mRNA expression versus the enhancer RNA activity. We found that targeting the TSS of CSF1 led to the downregulation of six genes (CSF1, RSAD2, NID2, IL7R, NCF2, and SYT12) and the upregulation of four genes (PRKAB1, UPP1, BHLHE41, and THBD) using a p-value-adjusted cutoff of <0.1 and a base mean expression >20 (DESeq2 mean of normalized counts for all samples) (Figure 3E,F). Epigenetic repression of the CSF1 enhancer resulted in the statistically significant downregulation of two genes, CSF1 and RSAD2 (Figure 3E,F). The presence of CSF1 downregulation in both conditions confirms our previous findings that this enhancer is driving the expression of CSF1. The reduced expression of RSAD2 in both TSS and enhancer-targeting samples suggests a relationship with CSF1 gene expression that had not been previously reported. These results suggest that the enhancer is likely upregulating CSF1 expression and that CSF1 may be part of a more complex network of gene expression.3.4. Activity of the CSF1 Enhancer Is Correlated with Reduced Patient SurvivalThe evidence collected thus far suggests that the CSF1 enhancer is specific to triple-negative breast cancer, may be conferring growth advantages to tumor cells, and a reduction in CSF1 leads to changes in the expression of several other genes. This led us to speculate that the CSF1 enhancer could be impacting patient outcomes. To address this, we first focused on genes that were downregulated upon CRISPRi inhibition of the CSF1 TSS and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) using the Cox proportional hazards model for each gene using the METABRIC breast cancer dataset (Figure 3G). We found that several genes had a HR of >1 (RSAD2, NCF2, and SYT12), indicating a negative impact on patient outcome. RSAD2 was notable for having the largest HR (1.279, p-value 1.35 \u00d7 10\u22124) and being affected when either the CSF1 TSS or CSF1 enhancer were inhibited. Interestingly, CSF1 alone was not associated with a significant negative outcome in our analysis of this dataset. Focusing on RSAD2, we stratified patients into either high or low expression groups and generated a Kaplan-Meier survival curve to evaluate the impact on overall survival probability (Figure 3H). This showed a significant reduction in patient survival, using a log-rank test, when RSAD2 is upregulated. The Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve generated using the CSF1 enhancer knockdown associated genes (CSF1 and RSAD2) also shows a reduced patient survival that is statistically significant (Figure 3I). These findings, combined with our biological assays, suggest that activation of the CSF1 enhancer leads to increased expression of CSF1 and additional downstream genes that may be contributing to the aggressive nature of TNBC tumors and negatively impacting patient survival.3.5. Enhancer RNA Transcripts Are Necessary for CSF1 Upregulation in a Post-Transcriptional MechanismWith a clinical significance established for this novel enhancer, we next sought to understand how eRNA transcription contributed to the function of the enhancer. There are several models for enhancer function that place varying levels of importance on the eRNA transcripts produced. Some suggest that the act of transcription is sufficient for enhancer function with no direct role for the eRNA transcript itself. Others indicate that the transcripts can perform a post-transcriptional role that is necessary for target gene upregulation. Further complicating the matter, these studies demonstrate that enhancers can use distinct mechanisms of function at different loci. Of note, while CRISPRi epigenetic repression of the enhancer led to a downregulation of CSF1 mRNA, this does not clarify whether the loss of eRNA production or the disrupted enhancer\u2013promoter interaction caused by KRAB are responsible for this change. It is possible that either of these changes alone or both together are necessary to observe this result. Therefore, separating the opportunity for enhancer\u2013promoter physical interaction and the act of transcription from a post-transcriptional role for eRNAs requires techniques that allow for direct perturbation of transcripts without altering enhancer transcription or the underlying DNA. To address this, we modified and employed a recently described approach using Cas13, an RNA-guided CRISPR enzyme that allows for targeted cleavage of RNA transcripts with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency. Cas13 functions similarly to DNA targeting CRISPR enzymes such as Cas9 but instead binds and cleaves RNA transcripts. To facilitate the targeted degradation of eRNA transcripts, we leveraged the pC0046-EF1a-PspCas13b-NES-HIV (Addgene #103862) vector containing the Prevotella Sp. (Psp) Cas13b enzyme in a lentiviral vector. We modified this plasmid to enable targeting within the nucleus by removing the nuclear export signal, inserting multiple nuclear localization sequences, and introducing a blasticidin resistance gene for clonal selection (Figure 4A). MDA-MB-436 TNBC cells were transduced with this modified PspCas13b vector to create a stable expression cell line that was confirmed through Western blot using an antibody that recognizes Cas13b via the HA tag (Figure 4B). Target sites for sgRNAs were carefully selected using both the Cas13 Guide Design Resource () and RNAfold () to predict regions of the eRNA transcripts that are likely to form secondary structures that can prevent an sgRNA from recognizing its target sequence (Figure 4D). To mitigate the effects of secondary RNA structures, multiple sgRNAs were designed and pooled per target transcript. The transfection of sgRNAs followed by qRT-PCR to examine CSF1 mRNA expression shows that targeting the mRNA directly with Cas13b has the most robust knockdown effect (Figure 4E). This outcome demonstrates that Cas13b is capable of cleaving the CSF1 mRNA for targeted knockdown. Next, we targeted the CSF1 enhancers RNAs (both positive and negative strand) using Cas13b and found that this was sufficient to cause a significant decrease in CSF1 mRNA levels (Figure 4E). This suggests that the CSF1 eRNA transcripts are required post-transcriptionally for mRNA upregulation, as this technique degrades targeted transcripts but does not impact their transcription.To further bolster our eRNA knockdown studies, we employed a more recently described version of Cas13 (RfxCas13d or CasRx) that is derived from Ruminococcus flavefaciens, is smaller than Cas13b, and has been shown to function effectively within the nucleus. To determine if RfxCas13d could reproduce our CSF1 eRNA knockdown results, we created multiple MDA-MB-436 TNBC cell lines that stably express RfxCas13d and a single guide RNA targeting the eRNA positive strand transcript. Using qRT-PCR in two independent cell lines, we found that stably targeting and disrupting the eRNA transcript led to a significant reduction in CSF1 mRNA when compared to a non-targeting scrambled sgRNA, confirming our results using Cas13b (Figure 4F). As an orthogonal approach to the Cas13 experiments, we used siRNA-mediated RNA-interference assays designed to target and degrade either the positive or negative strand eRNAs. Like Cas13b-targeted degradation, this allows for a specific perturbation of the eRNA transcripts apart from the act of transcription. Using qRT-PCR to assess changes in CSF1 eRNA and mRNA levels, we found that the siRNA-mediated degradation of either eRNA transcript led to a decrease in CSF1 mRNA (Figure 4G). This finding confirms the Cas13 results and indicates that the eRNA transcripts are crucial for enhancer function.3.6. The CSF1 Enhancer Is Active in Ovarian Cancer and eRNA Transcription Is Essential for FunctionTo further test the mechanisms of CSF1 enhancer function and determine if our observations about this enhancer are extensible to other cancer types, we surveyed the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas dataset to identify other types of cancer in which CSF1 is highly expressed. Interestingly, we found that ovarian cancer was among the highest in CSF1 mRNA expression (RSEM) and even surpassed breast cancer (Figure 5A). In addition, we found that increased CSF1 expression was correlated with a worse outcome in ovarian cancer patients, as determined by a Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve (Figure 5A). To ascertain if the enhancer was active in ovarian cancer cells and may be responsible for this increased expression, we downloaded publicly available H3K27ac and BRD4 ChIP-seq datasets and looked for the enrichment of these marks at the CSF1 enhancer region (Figure 5B). In the absence of publicly available GRO-seq data, we instead relied on a combination of H3K27ac and BRD4 ChIP-seq to indicate activity of the enhancer. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) is known to be enriched on active enhancers, and combined with H3K27ac, provides a robust method to identify active enhancers. As seen in Figure 5B, the CSF1 enhancer is highly active in the high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3. Therefore, to test our model in ovarian cancer cells, we created dCas9-KRAB expressing OVCAR3 cell lines and repeated the CRISPRi experiments using the same sgRNAs to epigenetically repress the CSF1 enhancer. We found that inhibition of the enhancer led to a decrease in CSF1 mRNA and both eRNA transcripts (positive and negative strand), matching the results observed in TNBC cell line experiments (Figure 5C). In this experiment, we also targeted the CSF1 TSS with sgRNAs designed to repress transcription of the mRNA without inhibiting the enhancer. Interestingly, we found that directly targeting the TSS led to the most robust knockdown in mRNA levels but did not affect the expression of either eRNA transcript (Figure 5C). Next, we created Cas13b expressing OVCAR3 cell lines to test the role of the eRNAs directly. As is observed in the TNBC eRNA perturbation experiment, there was a significant decrease in CSF1 mRNA expression upon the degradation of the eRNA transcript (Figure 5D). Taken together, we demonstrate that eRNA transcripts are required for the regulation of CSF1 gene expression, and we posit that this observation could be generalizable to other eRNA-target gene relationships. This work implicates a role for the CSF1 enhancer in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer and potentially other cancer types, highlighting the eRNA transcripts and associated downstream genes as potential targets for the therapeutic intervention.4. DiscussionResearch into the networks of genes altered by enhancers in cancer has also exposed the multitude of genomic lesions that can transform these regions. While germline variants are often found to increase the risk of tumor development, they are typically not sufficient to trigger cancer formation. Accumulated somatic mutations on top of these germline variants often have more profound effects, such as conferring growth advantages that drive tumor formation. Additional mechanisms to activate oncogenes include chromosomal translocations that place them under the control of previously unassociated enhancers, large deletions or rearrangements that connect them with upregulating elements, amplifications that can convert an individual enhancer into a super-enhancer, and more discreet mutations that constitutively activate regulatory regions. This emphasizes the need for expanded research into non-coding elements in the genome to fully understand the mechanisms of gene regulation and the consequences in cancer. Identification of pathogenic enhancer activity can provide new targets for study and intervention through the elements themselves or the collection of genes they regulate.In this study, we leveraged eRNA expression to identify a novel enhancer of CSF1 that was active specifically in the TNBC subtype of breast cancer. Patient-derived datasets confirmed that this enhancer is most active in TNBC individuals, and we were able to detect CSF1 eRNA and mRNA transcripts in patient tumor samples. This supports our findings in cell lines and makes them extensible to breast cancer patients. We used Cas9 knockout cell lines to demonstrate that this region is a true enhancer for the CSF1 gene. Surprisingly, heterozygous deletion of the enhancer was sufficient to cause profound defects in cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation, highlighting the biological importance of this enhancer. Since deletion of the enhancer could potentially have unintended genomic consequences, we leveraged CRISPR interference (dCas9-KRAB) assays that allowed us to focus on the necessity for transcription of the enhancer without altering the underlying DNA. Epigenetic silencing of the enhancer caused a reduction in CSF1 eRNA and mRNA expression, indicating that transcription is vital for enhancer function. We also used this approach as an opportunity to identify other targets of the enhancer using CRISPRi-coupled to RNA-seq. We confirmed CSF1 as target gene of the enhancer and identified several genes that appear to be impacted by the CSF1 enhancer, notably RSAD2. While high expression of CSF1 alone is not associated with poor patient outcomes in the datasets we analyzed, previous work indicates that CSF1 is involved with the formation of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) that are significant for cancer development and progression. Interestingly, increased expression of RSAD2 is associated with worse survival for breast cancer patients, and to our knowledge, the relationship between CSF1 and RSAD2 has not been shown before. We found that RSAD2 expression decreases when we repress either the CSF1 enhancer or the CSF1 transcription start site, suggesting that RSAD2 is not a target gene of the enhancer but instead depends on the expression of CSF1. This discovery highlights both genes as interesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention and warrants further investigation that is outside the scope of this work.We next focused our attention on the significance of the eRNA transcripts at the CSF1 enhancer by employing multiple versions of a CRISPR-based RNA-guided RNA-knockdown approach using newly discovered Cas13 effector proteins. This technique allows us to test the functions of the eRNA transcripts themselves without affecting the enhancer itself. We used both a modified version of PspCas13b and unmodified RfxCas13d to target and degrade eRNA transcripts originating from the enhancer, which led to a significant reduction in CSF1 mRNA expression. This indicates that the eRNAs are required post-transcriptionally for the function of the enhancer, and these results were confirmed using RNA interference techniques (siRNAs) to achieve similar results. Moreover, we validated this mechanism in ovarian cancer cell lines. Thus, we posit that the CSF1 enhancer RNAs serve a required function in the enhancer mechanism, likely through the binding of transcription factors, stabilizing the enhancer\u2013promoter loop interactions, or via sequestering repressive factors that could inhibit target gene upregulation. While this work does not define the specific function of these transcripts, it demonstrates the significant impact that these non-coding RNAs can have in an aggressive form of cancer. This also confirms that eRNA production is a valuable indicator of enhancer activity and can be leveraged to identify novel enhancers, even in circumstances where the enhancer has been rewired in cancer cells. This work supports other studies suggesting eRNAs serve a functional part of the enhancer mechanism that should be explored further. We know that eRNAs are produced with similar kinetics to their target genes and have a high turnover rate due to degradation by the exosome. We have also learned that eRNA transcripts can perform several roles for target gene upregulation, which can vary from enhancer to enhancer. This necessitates the investigation of each enhancer/eRNA transcript to confirm its specific utility at a given loci. Interestingly, enhancer RNAs have already been suggested as targets for cancer therapeutic intervention and are likely to play an important role in cancer diagnosis and treatment in the future. This work bolsters these ideas and encourages further investigation into eRNAs and enhancers in the context of cancer, which we believe will provide future avenues for therapeutic intervention.Though the study of these eRNA transcripts is vital to advance cancer research, their investigation also presents certain challenges that must be overcome to gain meaningful insight. One obstacle is selecting a target site for either Cas13-based guide RNAs or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These sites need to be free of secondary structures to facilitate proper targeting and degradation, which typically requires the use of complex structure-prediction software and manually testing several gRNAs. If using qRT-PCR to examine changes in eRNA levels after targeted degradation, it is also important to consider the location of primers. Transcripts that have been cut at a single site may still be detected as a complete transcript if the PCR primers lie within one segment of the cut RNA. This creates additional considerations for Cas13, which does not yet have a well-established cut site, but instead is thought to cleave at uracil-rich regions near the sgRNA targeting location. This can make primer placement more difficult but may not be a major concern as the enzyme is likely to cut in multiple locations, increasing the likelihood of a break between forward and reverse primers. Another potential issue that should be addressed when targeting eRNA transcripts for knockdown is the kinetics of eRNA transcription and eRNA degradation. We know that most eRNAs are produced at a similar rate to their target genes, but the rate of eRNA degradation when using Cas13 or RNAi is not clear. eRNAs are also predominantly non-polyadenylated and therefore have a very short half-life. Using qRT-PCR to detect changes in eRNA levels after targeted knockdown is inherently difficult as the transcripts are being constantly produced, and the pool that exists in the nucleus is short-lived. While some studies avoid this issue by investigating eRNAs that are polyadenylated or relatively stable by other means, this is likely to be a concern for a majority of eRNA studies moving forward. The establishment of a target gene relationship and using detection of target gene mRNA expression as a readout is one option, but there may be other approaches that could be employed in the future. One potential alternative is the use of small molecule inhibitors, such as flavopiridol to inhibit the transcription of RNA polymerase II, which would prevent continued production of enhancer RNAs and allow for the measurement of the existing pool of eRNAs. However, this still leaves a constantly diminishing pool of transcripts to work with and could have other impacts on the cells not associated with eRNA knockdown. Another potential approach is the inhibition of the exosome, which has been used to create a buildup of enhancer RNAs and allows for a better detection of knockdown efficiency. This may also lead to non-specific results but could be employed for the sole purpose of estimating eRNA knockdown efficiency for a given technique. Regardless of these caveats, the investigation of enhancer RNAs has proven to be complicated, yet paramount to many fields of research. The work presented here demonstrates the significance of eRNA transcripts and their importance specifically to triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, which we anticipate will be extensible to other forms of cancer. Understanding how these transcripts enable target gene upregulation and how they can be exploited to detect and/or treat cancer is important for the fields of cancer biology and gene regulation alike.5. ConclusionsCancer is a challenging disease to study, due in part to the wide variety of mutations and rearrangements that can give rise to pathogenesis. One hallmark of breast cancer is the inappropriate expression of genes, typically driven by regulatory networks that are often rewired through various molecular aberrations. This is best demonstrated by the association between cancer and the unusually high number of mutations within transcription factors. It has also become apparent that cancer cells rely heavily on increased transcription, often referred to as transcriptional addiction, that is necessary to drive pathogenic expression pathways required for continual growth. As we continue to learn more about the significant impact of enhancers regulating large networks of genes, we can better understand the potential for deleterious effects when enhancers are rewired. Investigation into how the disruption of large-scale gene regulation can impact disease, specifically cancer, has shown that minor defects in regulatory regions can have profound effects downstream. Developing a thorough understanding of changes in enhancer function that drive pathogenesis of specific cancers will prove critical to developing effective treatments.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: CSF1 enhancer knockout in MDA-MB-468 cells and apoptosis assay of MDA-MB-436 CSF1e-KO cells (related to Figure 2).

        "content": "Tumorigenic cells undergo cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D Matrigel environment. Here, we expanded this 3D platform to assess the interactions of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human primary mammary fibroblasts (HPMFs) with breast cancer-derived, tumorigenic cells (MDA-MB-231). Medium conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells activates both types of fibroblasts, imbuing them with the capacity to accelerate the rate of aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells more than four fold. Acceleration is achieved 1) by direct physical interactions with MDA-MB-231 cells, in which activated fibroblasts penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel 3D environment and function as supporting scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 aggregation and coalescence, and 2) through the release of soluble accelerating factors, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and, in the case of activated NHDFs, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12. Fibroblast activation includes changes in morphology, motility, and gene expression. Podoplanin (PDPN) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are upregulated by more than nine-fold in activated NHDFs while activated HPMFs upregulate FAP, vimentin, desmin, platelet derived growth factor receptor A and S100A4.

Here, we expanded this 3D platform to assess the interactions of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and human primary mammary fibroblasts (HPMFs) with breast cancer-derived, tumorigenic cells (MDA-MB-231). Medium conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells activates both types of fibroblasts, imbuing them with the capacity to accelerate the rate of aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells more than four fold. Acceleration is achieved 1) by direct physical interactions with MDA-MB-231 cells, in which activated fibroblasts penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel 3D environment and function as supporting scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 aggregation and coalescence, and 2) through the release of soluble accelerating factors, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) and, in the case of activated NHDFs, SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12. Fibroblast activation includes changes in morphology, motility, and gene expression. Podoplanin (PDPN) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are upregulated by more than nine-fold in activated NHDFs while activated HPMFs upregulate FAP, vimentin, desmin, platelet derived growth factor receptor A and S100A4. Overexpression of PDPN, but not FAP, in NHDF cells in the absence of MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium, activates NHDFs. These results reveal that complex reciprocal signaling between fibroblasts and cancer cells, coupled with their physical interactions, occurs in a highly coordinated fashion that orchestrates aggregation and coalescence, behaviors specific to cancer cells in a 3D environment. These in vitro interactions may reflect events involved in early tumorigenesis, particularly in cases of field cancerization, and may represent a new mechanism whereby cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor growth.IntroductionIt is well-established that stromal cells are hijacked by a developing tumor to generate a tumor-specific stroma that, in turn, promotes cancer progression and metastasis. Fibroblasts within the tumor stroma, referred to as \u201ccancer-associated fibroblasts\u201d or CAFs, exhibit a cancer-associated phenotype and have been demonstrated to be major players in cancer progression. Mechanisms whereby CAFs promote tumor progression and metastasis include: 1) extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling mediated by upregulation of the proteoglycan syndecan I and alterations in collagen composition and 2) secretion of soluble growth factors or cytokines that support cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration. In addition, CAFs may facilitate metastasis by direct contact with cancer cells. The relationship between cancer cells and fibroblasts in tumorigenesis is, therefore, reciprocal.Here we have explored reciprocal signaling and physical interactions between breast cancer-derived tumorigenic cells (MDA-MB-231) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) as well as between MDA-MB-231 cells and human primary mammary fibroblasts (HPMFs) in a 3D Matrigel environment in which cancer cells, but not normal cells, aggregate. Aggregates then coalesce to form large aggregates with shapes reflective of their tumor of origin. We found that breast tumor cells release an activation factor(s) that causes changes in both dermal and mammary fibroblast shape and motility, and alterations in gene expression. Although the altered gene expression pattern differs between activated dermal and activated mammary fibroblasts, both types of activated fibroblasts markedly accelerate MDA-MB-231 coalescence relative to unconditioned fibroblasts. Interestingly, activated mammary fibroblasts are even more effective at inducing coalescence of MDA-MB-231than activated NHDFs.The activated fibroblasts, referred to here as cancer cell conditioned-normal human dermal fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs) or cancer cell conditioned-human primary mammary fibroblasts (CC-HPMFs), are imbued with the capacity to invade the 3D Matrigel environment where they accelerate the rate of MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence. We found that this acceleration is mediated by 1) soluble factors released by activated fibroblasts and 2) by the dynamic participation of CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs, which function as scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 aggregation. We further demonstrate that overexpressing podoplanin (PDPN), but not fibroblast activation protein (FAP), in NHDFs in the absence of the soluble activators from cancer cell-conditioned medium, activates fibroblasts, and imbues them with the capacity to accelerate cancer cell aggregation and coalescence.The functions described here for activated fibroblasts are distinct from the roles typically attributed to CAFs such as promotion of metastasis by basement membrane remodeling and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our data support a model in which CAFs drive coalescence, and by so doing, may promote tumorigenesis, particularly in cases of field cancerization.Material and methodsGrowth and maintenance of cell lines and primary cellsNormal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and Fibroblast Growth Medium containing 2% fetal calf serum (FGM), insulin (5\u03bcg/mL) and FGF-2 (1ng/mL) were obtained from PromoCell (http://www.promocell.com/) and cells were cultured as specified by the supplier. Human Primary Mammary Fibroblasts (HPMFs), HPMF growth media (HPMF-GM), the Fibroblast Medium Supplement Kit (FBS, hydrocortisone, L-glutamine, FGF and an antibiotic-anti-mycotic solution) and gelatin coating solution were obtained from Cell Biologics (http://www.cellbiologics.net). HPMF cells were cultured in HPMF-GM with the added supplements for 6\u20137 passages as specified by the supplier. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured for 12\u201315 passages in MCF media. MCF medium is DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% horse serum, human recombinant EGF, insulin, hydrocortisone and cholera toxin, all obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and penicillin-streptomycin from Thermo -Fisher (Grand Island, NY). GFP tagged human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs-GFP) were obtained from Angio-proteomie (www.angioproteomie.com) and cultured according to the supplier\u2019s directions.Activation of fibroblasts by MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium and assay preparationsTo generate cancer cell conditioned fibroblast growth media (CC-FGM), MDA-MB-231 cells were grown for 72 hours to 70\u201380% confluency in 10 mL of FGM containing 2% fetal calf serum (Fig 1A1). The CC-FGM medium was then withdrawn from the culture flask and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter to remove any detached MDA-MB-231cells or cell debris. To generate cancer cell conditioned fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs) (Fig 1B1), NHDFs were grown for 72 hours to 70\u201380% confluency in the filtered CC-FGM plus 30% fresh FGM. As a control, NHDFs were grown to 70\u201380% confluency in FGM containing 2% fetal calf serum for 72 hours to generate fibroblast conditioned FGM (F-FGM) (Fig 1A2). The F-FGM was collected and filtered in the same manner as the CC-FGM. Next, NHDFs were grown to 70\u201380% confluency for 72 hours in the filtered F-FGM to generate fibroblast cell conditioned fibroblasts (F-NHDFs) (Fig 1B2). Cancer cell conditioned HPMFs (CC-HPMFs) and fibroblast cell conditioned HPMFs (F-HPMFs) were generated using this same protocol with HPMF-GM. To determine if results were specific to one formula of media, reciprocal media controls were performed by culturing HPMFs in MCF media and CC-MCF media, again following the protocol illustrated in Fig 1. To determine if growth factors in the growth media were responsible for stimulating the MDA-MB-231 cancer cells to condition the media, minimal conditioned media (CC- minimal MCF) was prepared by culturing MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in MCF media without insulin or EGF and supplemented with 10% serum that had been charcoal stripped to remove growth factors (https://www.atlanta-biologicals.com). Finally, as an additional control, fibroblasts were grown in FGM or HPMF-GM that had not been conditioned by either MDA-MB-231 cells or by fibroblasts.The preparation used to analyze fibroblast cell motility and to compare the effects of F-NHDFs, F-HPMFs, CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs on the aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells.To prepare samples for 2D analysis of fibroblast motility, the 30 mm glass insert in a 60 mm Petri dish (https://www.cellvis.com/) was pre-coated with Type I human collagen (https://www.advancedbiomatrix.com) according to the supplier\u2019s instructions. Next, a 500 \u03bcl aliquot containing 5 x 104 NHDFs in FGM, F-NHDFs in F-FGM, CC-NHDFs in CC-FGM, HPMFs in HPMF-GM, F-HPMFs in F-HPMF-GM, or CC-HPMFs in CC-HPMF-GM was dispersed onto the collagen-coated insert. Cells were allowed to adhere for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Fig 1C) followed by addition of 5 ml of the appropriate media. To assay coalescence in 2D and 3D in the presence of fibroblasts, fibroblasts were first plated on the collagen-coated insert as described above. MDA-MB-231 cells were then harvested and 5x105 cells in 250 \u03bcl of medium were mixed with ice-cold Matrigel (Fig 1C) as described elsewhere in detail. Medium was removed from the collagen-coated insert and 750 \u03bcl of the cell/Matrigel mixture were gently applied over the fibroblasts (Fig 1D). The Matrigel was allowed to gel by incubating the dishes for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 and 5 ml of MCF media was then added. 2D and 3D images were acquired on a microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Fig 1E).2D analysis of fibroblast cell shape and motilityFibroblasts were plated on the collagen-coated insert of a Petri dish as described above. 2D images at 4x or 10x magnification were acquired through an Olympus CK2 microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Illumination and acquisition were synchronized using Fire-I software (www.unibrain.com/products/fire-i-software/). A series of JPEG images were acquired every 45 seconds with a XCD-V50 camera (Sony, San Diego, CA). The images were imported into J3D-DIAS4.2 and compiled into JDIAS movie format for motion and shape analysis. Cells were outlined at 7.5 minute intervals for 6 hours. Stacked perimeter plots were generated and length, width, perimeter, area and instantaneous velocity calculated as described previously. J3D-DIAS4.2 calculates persistence as the ratio of net to total path length at 5 frame intervals and averaged over the total path length.2D and 3D analysis of MDA-MB-231 aggregation and aggregate coalescence in the presence of NHDF, F-NHDF, F-HPMF, CC-NHDF and CC-HPMF cellsNHDFs, F-NHDF, HPMFs, F-HPMFs, CC-NHDFs or CC-HPMFs were plated onto the collagen-coated insert and overlayed with a Matrigel/MDA-MB-231 cell suspension as described above. 2D images at 4X and 10X magnification were acquired through an Olympus CK2 microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. For 3D analyses of coalescence with DIC optics, a lid with a glass insert was used to cover the dish. 3D cultures were imaged through a 20x objective using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) optics on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a motor-driven stage synchronized to a Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 IEEE 1394 color CCD camera and an LED light source. The microscope was housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0in 5% CO2. A z-series of optical sections was acquired through the preparation at 10 \u03bcm increments and this process repeated every 10 minutes for up to 5 days. The z-series was imported into J3D-DIAS4.2 and saved in movie format for 3D reconstructions, as previously described.ImmunostainingFibroblasts were plated on the collagen-coated insert (described above) and incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0 C in 5% CO2 before addition of 5 mL of media to the dish. After 24 hours, the preparation was rinsed with PBS and immunostained as described previously. Cells were stained with the anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (mAb) AMF-17b (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, (DSHB) http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu) diluted 1:10 in PBS, or the rat anti-human podoplanin mAb NZ-1 (AngiobioCo., San Diego, CA) diluted 1:200 in PBS. The AMF-17b preparation was stained with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and the NZ-1 preparation with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch).qRT-PCRFor RNA preparations, conditioned and unconditioned fibroblast cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in RNAlater solution (Ambion, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). The TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was employed to remove DNA. The quality of the RNA was confirmed with the Experion RNA StdSens and HighSens Analysis Kit (Bio-Rad) that assigned an RNA Quality Index (RQI) >9.5 for our samples, indicating little to no RNA degradation had occurred. To generate cDNA from the RNA samples, the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used, as recommended by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR assays were performed with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix (Roche) using 50 ng of the cDNA. The expression levels of the genes of interest were quantified using a Roche LightCycler480 real-time PCR detection system with SYBR green. The qRT-PCR assay for each of the tested genes was repeated three times, each in triplicate. The relative expression level of the genes was normalized to that of GAPDH. Primer pairs used for qRT-PCR are listed in S1 Table.Western blot analysis of cell lysates and mediaWestern analysis of protein from cell lysates was performed as previously described. Rat anti-podoplanin NZ-1 (AngiobioCo., San Diego, CA) and mouse anti-FAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC) were employed as primary antibodies. Mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin mAb E7 (DSHB; http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu) was used as a loading control. To assess the release of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, media were concentrated with Amicon Ultra 3K centrifugal filter devices (Merck Millipore Ltd.) according to the supplier\u2019s protocol. Recombinant human SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 (R&D Systems; https://www.rndsystems.com) was used as a positive control. Rabbit anti-human SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to detect the cytokine. IRDye 800-conjugated goat anti-rat, goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were used as secondary antibodies. Odyssey scanner and software were used for detection and quantification of immunoblots (Li-Cor Biosciences).Transwell assay with NHDF cellsA Corning Incorporated Transwell plate with 24 mm inserts, the latter constructed from 0.4 \u03bcm pore membranes (https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en.html), was used to test whether conditioned fibroblasts released a soluble factor capable of traversing the membrane to affect MDA-MB-231 cell behavior in the absence of fibroblast/cancer cell-cell contact. The plate well was first pre-coated with 100 \u03bcl of Matrigel. MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted to 1\u00d7106 cells per ml in MCF medium, chilled on ice, and a 500 \u03bcl aliquot mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold Matrigel. The chilled MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixture was then inoculated into the pre-coated well. F-NHDF or CC-NHDF cultures, containing 4\u00d7104 cells, were suspended in 400 \u03bcl of F-FGM or CC-FGM medium, respectively, and spread on the insert filter over an empty well. The plate was then allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C to allow for gelation of the Matrigel as well as attachment of the fibroblasts to the insert filter. Media were removed from the inserts and the inserts transferred on to wells containing the MDA-MB-231 cell/Matrigel mixture. The transwell preparation was incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to allow gelation of the Matrigel, followed by addition of 2.5 ml of MCF medium to each well. Images were acquired daily for four days using the 10X objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. To confirm that fibroblasts could not migrate through the insert filter, the transwell assay was performed using NHDF cells in the absence of MDA-MB-231 cells and the bottom well examined microscopically.Development of NHDF overexpression strainsTo overexpress human PDPN and FAP genes transiently in NHDFs, we constructed plasmids pPDPN-C3 and pFAP-C3. To construct the overexpression plasmids, the PDPN and FAP genes were amplified by PCR from the plasmids containing human PDPN cDNA (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/GetCloneDetail.do?cloneid=443900) and human FAP cDNA (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/GetCloneDetail.do?cloneid=43440) with the primer pairs PDPN-1/-2 and FAP-1/-2, respectively. The PCR amplified coding regions of the genes were cloned under the control of CMV promoter in the plasmid pEGFP-C3 (BD Bioscienes Clonetech, Mountain View, CA, USA) by enzyme restriction with AgeI and SalI and followed by ligation. To generate a control expression plasmid pmCherry-C3, the EGFP coding region in the plasmid pEGFP-C3 was swapped with the mCherry gene that was amplified from a plasmid with mCherry by PCR with primer pair mCherry-1/-2. Primer pairs used for generating the overexpression and control plasmids are listed in S1 Table. All sequences of the genes were verified after cloning. To generate PDPN and FAP overexpression strains, NHDF-PDPNoe and NHDF-FAPoe transfections of the plasmids into NHDF cells were performed using FuGENE transfection reagent (www.promega.com) according to the supplier\u2019s specifications and confirmed by positive expression of mCherry.Treatment of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs with anti-PDPN mAbmAb NZ-1, described above, was affinity purified using a Protein G HP spin trap column (GE Healthcare, Cat.#28903134) and concentrated using an ultra-centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore, Cat.# UFC905024). The concentration was measured by a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific) and 0.67 \u03bcg added to 4x104 F-NHDFs or CC-NHDFs in 200 \u03bcl of medium. The preparations were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The contents of each tube were then divided equally between two collagen-coated wells. As controls, mAb in 200 \u03bcl PBS was processed similarly in the absence of cells. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. An MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixture was then cast over the fibroblast cell layer as described above. Images were acquired daily for four days using the 10X objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope.MMP Gelatinase Zymography and treatment with MMP inhibitorSterile-filtered media were diluted 1:1 with zymogram sample buffer (BioRad) and 20 \u03bcl loaded into each well of a Tris-Glycine Novex 10% zymogram protein gel copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin (Invitrogen). SDS-Page gels were run at 118V constant voltage for 90 minutes. Gelatinase activity was detected following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Images of the gel demonstrating cleared regions of enzymatic activity were captured using a light box and Nikon CoolPix camera. Digital images were quantitated using ImageJ software. NHDFs were cultured in CC-FGM with or without 50 \u03bcM of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (http://www.emdmillipore.com) for 72 hours.Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with SDF-1-\u03b1/CXCL12, anti- SDF-1-\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb and IL-6Recombinant SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and human/mouse SDF-1\u03b1 /CXCL12 mAb were obtained from R&D Systems (https://www.rndsystems.com) and reconstituted according to the supplier\u2019s specifications. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown for 24 hours in 10 ml of MCF media supplemented with 3 \u03bcg of the reconstituted protein or supplemented with 3 \u03bcg of the protein plus 25 \u03bcg of the anti-SDF-1\u03b1 mAb. To test the effect of IL-6 on MDA-MB-231s, cells were grown for 24 hours in MCF medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL of recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6, www.peprotech.co). To test the effect of rIL-6 on MDA-MB-231 cells, the rIL-6 treated MDA-MB-231 cells were embedded in 3D Matrigel as previously described. Images of 10 fields were taken at 24 hour intervals using a 4X objective.ResultsBreast cancer cell-conditioned medium activates NHDFs and alters gene expressionTo determine if treatment of fibroblasts with media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells altered the shape and motility of the fibroblasts, NHDF cells were treated with cancer cell conditioned or fibroblast cell conditioned media as described in the Methods. A comparison of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, fixed on a collagen substrate and stained with the anti-vimentin mAb AMF-1b, revealed markedly different morphologies (Fig 2 A and 2B). F-NHDFs were spindle shaped and bipolar (Fig 2A), whereas CC-NHDFs were spread and multipolar (Fig 2B). On a collagen-coated 2D substrate, cellular translocation tracks of F-NHDFs were long and persistent, (Fig 2C), while tracks of CC-NHDFs were random and less persistent (Fig 2D). Morphometric measurements revealed that CC-NHDFs were on average significantly longer (Fig 2E), presumably due to the numerous elongated lamellipodia and filopodia, while F-NHDFs were significantly narrower (Fig 2F), and possessed on average a much smaller perimeter (Fig 2G) and a significantly smaller area (Fig 2H), than CC-NHDFs. Instantaneous velocity, computed without directional bias, was similar for CC-NHDFs and F-NHDFs (Fig 2I), but the computed persistence of translocation was significantly higher for F-NHDFs than CC-NHDFs (Fig 2J). These results indicate that factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells alter both the morphology and behavior of dermal fibroblasts.Medium conditioned by the breast tumor-derived cell line MDA-MB-231 activates NHDFs affecting polarity, cellular translocation, morphology and gene expression.A, B. F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, stained for vimentin (green) to visualize cell shape, and with DAPI (blue) to visualize nuclei. C-D. Motility tracks at 7.5 minute intervals of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, generated by J3D-DIAS4.2 software that automatically detects cell perimeters and computes tracks. E- J.

The means and error bar (standard deviations) are presented in all panels for an N = 50. ***** indicates significance of p<0.00005, *** indicates significance p<0.0005, N.S indicates not significant. K. qRT-PCR analyses of the transcript levels of ten genes associated with fibroblast activation. Means and error bars (standard deviations) are presented for N = 3. Asterisk (*) indicates significance of p <0.05. L,M. F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, stained with anti-PDPN mAb NZ-1. Arrows denote punctate plasma membrane staining. N. Western blot of F-NHDF and CC-NHDF lysates probed with anti-PDPN mAb NZ-1 and the anti-tubulin mAb E7.Next, to determine if factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells altered gene expression in CC-NHDFs, expression of ten genes previously demonstrated to be involved in fibroblast activation and/or motility was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The genes included vimentin (VIM), PDPN, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (ACTA), the tyrosine kinase discoidin domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2), desmin (DES), FAP, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB), Ca++ binding protein (FSP1/S100A4), and syndecan1 (SDC1). Five of the genes, PDPN, ACTA, DDR2, FAP and PDGFRB were up-regulated in CC-NHDFs by more than two-fold (Fig 2K). PDPN was upregulated nine-fold and FAP ten-fold (Fig 2K). F-NHDF cells did not stain with the anti-podoplanin mAb (Fig 2L), but CC-NHDF cells stained intensely (Fig 2M, arrows). Western blot analysis supported the fluorescence data, demonstrating that PDPN was expressed in CC-NHDFs, but not in F-NHDFs (Fig 2N). Western blot analyses of FAP revealed that it was present in F-NHDFs, and the level increased several fold in CC-NHDFs (S1A Fig). Therefore, factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells induce changes in NHDF gene expression consistent with fibroblast activation.CC-NHDF cells accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescenceIn the experimental protocol employed, in the absence of a fibroblast substratum, cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence (hereafter referred to as \u201caggregation and coalescence\u201d) occurred slowly over 192 hours. At 72 hours, cells had moved through the gel, forming small aggregates (Fig 3A, arrows). Aggregation and coalescence continued so that by 144 hours, the great majority of cells in the field resided in a few large aggregates, and the surrounding Matrigel was depleted of single cells as previously described. When MDA-MB-231 cells were cast over F-NHDFs, the rates of aggregation and coalescence were similar (Fig 3A, arrows). When MDA-MB-231 cells were cast in Matrigel over CC-NHDFs, aggregation and coalescence occurred at a dramatically accelerated rate, forming large aggregates by 72 hours (Fig 3A, arrows), at least four-fold greater than preparations cast over F-NHDF cells. Quantitative analysis of the size of aggregates in 10 different fields of duplicate 72 hour cultures confirmed these differences (Fig 3B). The median area of MDA-MB-231 cell aggregates formed over CC-NHDFs was more than four-fold larger than those formed over F-NHDFs (Fig 3B).CC-NHDFs but not F-NHDFs accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment.A. Representative fields of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase is cast over the substrate in the absence of fibroblasts, over F-NHDF cells on collagen and over CC-NHDF cells on collagen. Red arrows indicate MDA-MB-231 aggregates. B. Measurements of aggregate areas at 72 hours in cultures in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase was cast over F-NHDF cells (blue) or CC-NHDF cells (orange). The median area of each population is noted as a blue or orange arrow, respectively. The difference between MDA-MB-231 aggregate areas was significantly greater (p< 0.00001) in the presence of CC-NHDF when compared to F-NHDFs.CC-NHDFs attract MDA-MB-231 cells and function as scaffolds in the 3D model2D imaging suggested that accelerated aggregation and coalescence was more pronounced in the Matrigel region closest to the CC-NHDF substratum. To explore this observation, we used the 3D reconstruction software J3D-DIAS4.2. In Fig 4A and 4B, side views of reconstructions are presented of a MDA-MB-231/Matrigel preparation cast over F-NHDF and CC-NHDF substrates. Fibroblasts are color-coded yellow and MDA-MB-231 cells and aggregates color-coded red. The MDA-MB-231 cells and small aggregates over the F-NHDF substratum remained dispersed throughout the 3D Matrigel matrix after 24 hours (Fig 4A), whereas MDA-MB-231 cells and small aggregates accumulated in the Matrigel region closest to the interface with the CC-NHDF substratum (Fig 4B, white arrows). The F-NHDF or CC-NHDF cells were distinguishable from the MDA-MB-231 cells over time by visually monitoring the optical sections collected every 10 minutes.CC-NHDF cells attract MDA-MB-231 cells and function as scaffolds to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of cancer cells.A, B. Side views of 3D reconstructions of MDA-MB-231 cells (red) in Matrigel cast over NHDF cells (yellow) on collagen or CC-NHDF cells (yellow) on collagen, respectively, after 24 hours of incubation. Arrows point to MDA-MB-231 aggregates forming at or near the collagen/Matrigel interface and in physical contact with CC-NHDFs. C. 3D of CC-NHDFs (yellow) and MDA-MB-231 cells (red) over a 21 hour period, with both cell types tracked by analyzing the optical section stacks at 10 minute intervals. D. 3D reconstructions of CC-NHDFs (yellow) and MDA-MB-231 cells (red) between 50 and 60 hours of incubation. Reconstructions were performed with J3D-DIAS4.2 software.To further investigate the interactions between CC-NHDFs and MDA-MB-231 cells in the 3D Matrigel environment, we reconstructed single cells and clusters of cells using J3D-DIAS4.2. In the first reconstructions in Fig 4C, a CC-NHDF cell (yellow, 1), at the CC-NHDF-MDA-MB-231/Matrigel interface at 0 hours moved in a directed fashion (arrow) towards an MDA-MB-231 cell (red, 1) between 0 and 3 hours. At 5.5 hours, the CC-NHDF contacted MDA-MB-231 cell 1, changed direction, and migrated towards a developing aggregate, with MDA-MB-231 cell 1 in tow (Fig 4C). During that same time period, two additional MDA-MB-231 cells, (red 2 and 3), in contact with another CC-NHDF cell, moved in the direction of CC-NHDF cell 1, and by 21 hours, MDA-MB-231 cells 1, 2 and 3 had aggregated around several CC-NHDF cells, including CC-NHDF cell 1 (Fig 4C). In a second reconstruction in a later time period, shown in Fig 4D, MDA-MB-231 cells (red) aggregated using CC-NHDF cells (yellow), as scaffolds. These behaviors were observed in additional regions optically sectioned in a similar fashion in multiple preparations.CC-NHDFs penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlayIn examining optical sections, it also appeared that CC-NHDFs, but not F-NHDFs, penetrated the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlay. To explore this observation, the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixtures were cast over NHDF-GFP cells treated with either fibroblast conditioned medium (\u201cF-NHDF-GFP cells\u201d) or MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium (\u201cCC-NHDF-GFP cells\u201d). DIC and fluorescent images were obtained at different distances through the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase after 72 hours of incubation. No F-NHDF-GFP cells were observed through 5 to 45 \u03bcm of the Matrigel phase (Fig 5A). However, CC-NHDF-GFP cells, were observed extending at least 30 \u03bcm into the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase (Fig 5B). After 96 hours, CC-NHDF-GFP cells (green) were enmeshed in the MDA-MB-231 cell aggregates within the Matrigel overlay (Fig 5C).CC-NHDFs act as scaffolds and penetrate MDA-MB-231 aggregates to support and facilitate aggregation.A. F-NHDF-GFP cells in the basal layer do not penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlay after 72 hours of incubation. B. CC-NHDF-GFP cells in the basal layer penetrate through at least 30 \u03bcm of the MB-231/Matrigel upper phase after 72 hours of incubation. Fluorescent images were combined with phase contrast images at ascending depths through the upper phase. Cells or their projections are numbered. C. Optical sections of an aggregate at 96 hours of culture formed in the Matrigel phase of a preparation in which CC-NHDF-GFP cells were plated on the collagen substratum. The fluorescent images of the CC-NHDFs and the phase DIC images of all the cells are merged for each optical section.A quantitative analysis was performed to verify that CC-NHDF cells had a greater propensity to invade the Matrigel and incorporate into MDA-MB-231 aggregates than F-NHDF cells. An examination of 10 independent aggregates at 172 hours in preparations containing F-NHDF-GFP cells revealed F-NHDF-GFP cells in 23% of MDA-MB-231 aggregates. The average number of F-NHDF-GFP cells within the 23% of aggregates containing them was 3 \u00b1 1.8. The highest level in the 150 \u03bcm z-series at which F-NHDF-GFP cells appeared in the aggregates was 33.6 \u03bcm \u00b1 14.3. In contrast, 100% of the 10 aggregates examined in the CC-NHDF-GFP preparations contained CC-NHDF-GFP with an average number of 54 \u00b1 15 CC-NHDF-GFP cells per aggregate (p<0.005). The average highest level in which CC-NHDF-GFP cells appeared in the aggregates was 100 \u03bcm \u00b1 28.2 (p<0.0005).The role of PDPNBecause PDPN and FAP were upregulated at the transcript level more than nine-fold in CC-NHDFs, we assessed whether upregulation of either played a role in the acquisition of the capacity of CC-NHDFs to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells. To that end, we generated the PDPN and FAP overexpression strains NHDF-PDPN\u0153 and NHDF-FAP\u0153. We then tested whether overexpression of either resulted in activation of NHDF cells, thereby imbuing them with the capacity to accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and coalescence in a 3D environment. After 24 hours, there was minimal aggregation of the MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel cast over a control NHDF substratum (Fig 6A). In marked contrast, after 24 hours, aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel cast over a NHDF-PDPN\u0153 substratum was accelerated (Fig 6B). After 72 hours, while MDA-MB-231 cells over the NHDF cells had formed medium-sized aggregates (Fig 6C), the majority of MDA-MB-231 cells over NHDF-PDPN\u0153 cells had coalesced into large aggregates (Fig 6D). Overexpressing FAP in NHDF cells, however, did not imbue them with the capacity to accelerate (S1B Fig). To further explore the role of PDPN, we tested whether anti-podoplanin mAb NZ-1 affected acceleration. Compared to the coalescence on a substratum of CC-NHDF cells (Fig 6E), NZ-1 reduced the rate of aggregation and coalescence (Fig 6F), reinforcing the conclusion that PDPN plays a central role in the capacity of CC-NHDF cells to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells in a 3D environment.Overexpression of podoplanin imbues NHDFs not activated with MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium with the capacity to accelerate aggregation and coalescence, and pretreatment of CC-NHDFs with anti-podoplanin mAb blocks its capacity to accelerate.A.

The inserts were overlaid with a suspension of either F-NHDFs or CC-NHDFs and placed over the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase, the latter in the bottom wells (Fig 7A). The MDA-MB-231 cells that were separated from untreated F-NHDF cells underwent coalescence at a far slower rate than MDA-MB-231 cells separated from CC-NHDF cells (Fig 7B) and the aggregates were more spheroid than those formed on CC-NHDF scaffolds. Microscopic scanning revealed that no CC-NHDF cells or lamellipodia had traversed the micropore filter. The transwell experiment therefore demonstrated that, in addition to direct physical interaction, activated fibroblasts also stimulated coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells by releasing soluble factors.CC-NHDFs release soluble signals that accelerate aggregation and coalescence.A.

D. Aggregation after 48 hours of MDA-MB-231 preparations over a CC-NHDF substratum in the absence and presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001. E. Western blot of media probed with anti-SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb. Recombinant SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 was used as a positive control. F. Coalescence after 48 and 72 hours of untreated MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 plus anti-SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb, and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with rIL-6.One possible candidate for acceleration factors released by activated fibroblasts were the MMPs. The levels of pro-MMP9, MMP9, MMP2 and MMP1, assessed by zymography were 5.5, 5.9, 1.3 and 7.5 fold higher, respectively, in CC-FGM taken after 72 hours on CC-NHDF cells (lane CC-FGM/CC-NHDF) (Fig 7C) than in F-FGM taken after 72 hours on NHDF cells (lane F-FGM). A small amount of pro-MMP2 was present in all samples of FGM, but apart from that weak band, MDA-MB-231 cells did not release detectable levels of MMPs into the CC-FGM (lane CC-FGM/MB-231s) (Fig 7C). Thus, dermal fibroblasts secreted relatively high levels of MMPs in response to treatment with cancer cell conditioned media. To confirm these data, we tested whether the MMP inhibitor, GM6001, blocked acceleration of coalescence using the CC-NHDF cells. After 24 hours of incubation, MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel overlaying a CC-NHDF substratum had begun to aggregate, but MDA-MB-231 cells overlaid onto CC-NHDF cultures that had been treated with GM6001 remained randomly dispersed (Fig 7D).The chemokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is also released by activated fibroblasts with reported effects on cancer cell locomotion and metastasis. Our Western blot analysis confirmed that CC-NHDFs released SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 into the media at levels several fold higher than F-NHDFs or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig 7E). We therefore grew MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 hours in the presence of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and monitored their subsequent aggregation and coalescence in the 3D Matrigel environment. Accelerated MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and coalescence was noted after 48 hours and was quite evident after 72 hours (Fig 7F). Addition of the anti- SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb to the culture medium containing SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 abrogated the effect (Fig 7F). Finally, we tested whether aggregation and coalescence were directly stimulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by treatment with rIL-6. To that end, rIL-6 was added to the growth medium for 24 hours prior to suspending the treated cells in Matrigel for the coalescence assay. Images acquired following 48 hours in Matrigel showed no effect from rIL-6 treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells, nor was acceleration observed at 72 hours (Fig 7F).Breast cancer cell-conditioned medium activates HPMFs affecting their polarity, morphology, gene expression, ability to accelerate coalescence and MMP releaseIn order to confirm the results obtained with CC-NHDFs, we performed similar experiments with conditioned and unconditioned primary mammary fibroblasts. As was the case with the dermal fibroblasts, dramatic changes in morphologies were noted in CC-HPMFs on a collagen substrate. That is, while F-HPMFs were spindle shaped and bipolar (Fig 8A), similar to F-NHDF cells and consistent with the morphology of young, non-senescent fibroblasts, CC-HPMFs were spread and multipolar (Fig 8B). Next, to determine if factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells altered gene expression in CC-HPMFs, we examined the expression of the same ten genes by qRT-PCR that we assessed in the dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, a different set of genes were upregulated in CC-HPMFs when compared to CC-NHDF cells. These included VIM, DES, FAP, PDFGRA and S100A4 while syndecan I (SDC1) was significantly downregulated (Fig 8 C). Nevertheless, when cast over CC-HPMFs, the rate of coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells far exceeded that observed with CC-NHDFs and was evident as early as 24 hours (Fig 8 D, arrows). In addition, destruction of the CC-HPMF monolayer was even more pronounced (Fig 8E, dashed red line) and the area of aggregates appeared significantly greater (Fig 8F, solid red line), an observation that was confirmed by measuring aggregate areas (Fig 8G). To determine if CC-HPMFs, like CC-NHDFs, released elevated MMPs, pro-MMP9, MMP9, pro-MMP2, MMP2 and MMP1 were assessed by gel zymography (Fig 8G). Pro-MMP9 was not detectable in any of the HPMF-GM preparations while pro-MMP2 was present in all samples. MMP9 and MMP2 were only detectable in CC-HPMF-GM/CC-HPMF while MMP1 was not detected in any of the media. Therefore, although dermal and mammary fibroblasts release different collagenase enzymes of the MMP family, both release relatively high levels of MMPs in response to treatment with cancer cell conditioned media.CC-HPMFs exhibit altered morphology, altered gene expression, accelerate MDA-MB-231 coalescence and release elevated MMPs.A, B.

E. Substrate level, 10x magnification of representative fields of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells over F-HPMF cells on collagen and over CC-HPMF cells on collagen reveals advanced coalescence and considerably more destruction of the CC-HPMF monolayer (dashed red line) in comparison to F-HPMF monolayer. F. Representative images of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells cast over F-HPMF cells on collagen and over CC-HPMF cells on collagen at 72 hours at the 50 \u03bcm level demonstrate significantly larger aggregates over the CC-HPMF layer (solid red line) in comparison to the F-HPMF layer. G. Measurements of aggregate areas at 72 hours in cultures in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase was cast over F-HPMF cells (gray), and CC-HPMF cells (yellow). The median area of each population is noted as a gray or yellow arrow, respectively. The difference between MDA-MB-231 aggregate areas was significantly greater (p< 0.00001) in the presence of CC-HPMFs when compared to F-HPMFs. H. Gel zymogram and quantitation of pixel intensities of MMPs in HPMF-GM directly from the bottle of sterile, unused media (no cells); F-HPMF-GM, media from 72 hour cultures of F-HPMFs; CC-HPMF-GM/MB-231, media from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 cultures; and CC-HPMF-GM/CC-HPMF, media from 72 hour CC-HPMF cultures.To determine if components specific to the HPMF-GM were stimulating the MDA-MB-231 cells to secrete activating factors into the conditioned medium, we performed the coalescence assay with different varieties of media. First, in a reciprocal media experiment, we conditioned HPMFs with MCF media from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 (CC-MCF). Second, we prepared a minimal MCF medium (CC-minimal MCF) by omitting growth factors and supplementing with serum that had been stripped of growth factors. We then conditioned HPMFs with CC- minimal MCF from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 cells. As controls, we cultured HPMFs in unconditioned MCF and unconditioned minimal MCF. Again, aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells were accelerated in the presence of conditioned HPMFs as compared to their unconditioned counterparts with obvious destruction of the fibroblast monolayer, similar to observations in CC-HPMF, with a slight delay at 24 hours in the CC- minimal MCF (S2 Fig). Therefore, secretion of fibroblast stimulatory factors by MDA-MB-231 cells is not media specific, although serum associated cytokines and growth factors, prevalent in the tumor microenvironment, likely enhance their ability to secrete these stimulatory factors.DiscussionBoth in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that CAFs and tumor cells interact to drive tumor progression, leading to several proposed models for reciprocal signaling. Given the significance of reciprocal signaling and the formation of tumors in a 3D environment, we have developed a 3D model to analyze not only signaling, but also physical interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells. We found that MDA-MB-231 cells release a fibroblast activation signal, and that these activated fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs) then accelerate breast cancer cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence by, in turn, releasing soluble factors and also by serving as physical scaffolds for breast cancer cell aggregation (Fig 9). The soluble factors appear to include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and, in the case of CC-NHDFs, the chemokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12.A model showing how activation of fibroblasts leads to accelerated coalescence of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a 3D Matrigel environment.A. Activation of NHDFs and HPMFs to CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs, respectively, after exposure to a medium conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells. B. Physical interactions between MDA-MB-231 cancer cells and CC-fibroblasts occur initially at the collagen 1/Matrigel interface but later throughout the 3D environment with CC-fibroblasts serving as scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 cell coalescence. C. Release of soluble signals by CC-NHDF and CC-HPMF cells accelerates coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells.NHDF activationFibroblasts can be activated by a number of molecular signals, depending upon body location, developmental circumstances such as embryogenesis, tissue maintenance, wound healing and tumorigenesis. Here, we have demonstrated that medium conditioned by the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 activates NHDFs and HPMFs, transforming them into CAFs with altered morphology, motility and gene expression, most notably, the capacity to accelerate breast tumor-derived MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment.NHDF activation by MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium resulted in more than a two-fold increase in the expression of five of the ten tested genes, selected for their association with fibroblast activation. The five included PDPN, ACTA, DDR2, FAP and PDGFRB. Because PDPN and FAP were the most dramatically upregulated and also previously implicated in fibroblast activation, we tested whether overexpression of either imbued NHDFs with the capacity to accelerate MDA-MB-231 aggregation and coalescence. Overexpressing PDPN did imbue NHDFs with the capacity to accelerate, but overexpressing FAP did not. In addition, pretreatment of CC-NHDFs with anti-PDPN antibody blocked their capacity to accelerate. These results indicate that PDPN plays a central role in NHDF activation.PDPN has been shown to regulate the Wnt/\u00df-cat signaling pathway, presumably through its interaction with ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family proteins that link cytoskeletal structures to cell membranes. Because PDPN was undetectable in NHDF cells, we assume that the activating factor released by MDA-MB-231 cells does not function through interaction with PDPN, but rather another receptor, and that activation through the Wnt/\u00df-cat pathway results in PDPN upregulation.Suchanski et al (2017) found that PDPN overexpression in fibroblasts co-cultured with cancer cells did not enhance migration or invasion of cancer cells, but did increase the motility of fibroblasts, measured indirectly by the ability of activated fibroblasts to traverse a filter with an 8 \u03bcm pore size. Although we did not see increased velocity in our direct measurements of CC-NHDF cell motility in which PDPN was upregulated, our finding that activation causes shape changes and Matrigel invasion are consistent with their reported increased ability to penetrate a filter.Activation of HPMFs resulted in upregulation of FAP, VIM, DES, PDFGRA and S100A4, while, interestingly, SCDI was significantly downregulated. In contrast to our results, in a study by Liakou et al (2016), SCD1 was upregulated in HPMFs treated for 24 hours with media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells. However, we employed a different conditioning protocol and, perhaps more importantly, our conditioning period was considerably longer. Thus, the discrepancy in SCD1 expression may be attributable to fibroblast plasticity and the existence of transitional fibroblast states. The difference is quite likely due to time-dependent changes in gene expression, including transcription factor genes, in a program of differentiation. CAFs are remarkably heterogeneic and transitional states with overlapping gene expression patterns are common in the tumor stroma. The upregulation of VIM, DES, and FAP are features of myofibroblasts. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the longer conditioning period we employed may reflect a myofibroblast-like transitional state, and is consistent with the prevalence of stromal cells with myofibroblast characteristics in epithelial tumors.Acceleration by physical interactionsAlthough numerous studies have focused on diffusible, soluble factors released by CAFs, that promote cancer progression through EMT and the concomitant acquisition of cancer cell motility and metastasis, only a few have examined possible physical interactions between CAFs and cancer cells. Gaggioli et al (2007) showed that CAFs generated tracks in a Matrigel/collagen matrix into which overlying squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCCs) collectively migrated. When CAFs and SCCs were mixed, the leading cell was typically a fibroblast during collective migration of the SCCs. Pretreatment of the matrix with CAFs, followed by removal of CAFs and subsequent seeding of the SCC cells enabled SCC invasion, suggesting that during metastasis, CAFs generated tracks in the matrix that cancer cells subsequently entered. In a later study it was reported that when CAFs and SCCs were co-cultured as spheroids in a Matrigel/collagen matrix, SCC cells followed the CAFs as the cells exited the spheroids. Most relevant to the results presented here, Knuchel et al (2015) demonstrated that fibroblasts promote colorectal cancer (CRC) cell elongation and motility through direct cell-cell interactions, and that adhesion appears to be mediated by FGF-2, FGFR and integrin \u03b1v\u00df5. They also demonstrated that fibroblasts directed CRC cells to exit established CRC spheroids.Our experimental design allowed us to observe dynamic physical interactions between fibroblasts overlayed with cancer cells in a 3D environment in which each cell type was plated in its normal microenvironment; i.e. fibroblasts on collagen and cancer cells of epithelial origin in the basement membrane matrix Matrigel. Our 4D analysis of live cultures revealed that fibroblasts were able to penetrate the matrix, and by 48 hours, functioned as scaffolds for cancer cell aggregation. Movement of MDA-MB-231 cells was directional, towards and along the elongated CC-NHDFs in the process of aggregation. Aggregates enveloped the CC-NHDFs. CC-NHDF migration and scaffolding occurred as much as 70 \u03bcm above the original CC-NHDF/Matrigel boundary. In support of our findings, fibroblasts isolated from the interface zone between breast tumors and stroma actively modulated tumor cell behavior in co-cultures to a greater extent than normal fibroblasts or fibroblasts within the tumor. Importantly, the interactions revealed in our model might occur very early in in vivo tumorigenesis and may explain tumor growth and tumor heterogeneity in cases of field cancerization, a widely documented occurrence in many types of cancers, including breast cancer, in which discrete, multiple islands or foci of neoplastic cells are present within the diseased tissue. Based on an examination of 783 oral tumors, Slaughter suggested that these foci grow independently and eventually coalesce to form a tumor, a suggestion that has been more recently documented in histological analyses of melanoma development in humans.Acceleration of coalescence by soluble factors released by CC-NHDF cellsCC-NHDFs accelerated aggregation and coalescence across the filter in a transwell assay without penetrating the filter, demonstrating that the CC-NHDFs released one or more soluble acceleration factors. However, the aggregates induced by soluble factors alone were far more compact than the aggregates accelerated by CC-NHDF scaffolding. This suggests either that the mechanism of acceleration by soluble factors differs from that mediated by physical scaffolding, or that in the latter case, the CC-NHDFs caused larger but more diffuse aggregates because their presence interfered with compactness of MDA-MB-231 cells. To identify acceleration factors, we tested several molecules reported to be secreted by activated fibroblasts. First, we found that CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are released by activated fibroblasts and remodel ECM, at five to ten times the level of inactivated fibroblasts, and that the MMP inhibitor GM6001 retarded aggregation and coalescence. MMPs, by remodeling the ECM, may facilitate fibroblast and MDA-MB-231 translocation through the 3D matrix, thus accelerating the process of aggregation and coalescence. Secondly, we found that the cytokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is released by CC-NHDFs and accelerates aggregation and coalescence. SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, which has been demonstrated to affect cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, must directly affect MDA-MB-231 behavior, probably through the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 receptor, which has been shown to be expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells.ConclusionBased on the tumor cell-specific characteristics of cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment, we designed an assay to investigate bidirectional signaling and physical cell-cell interactions of fibroblasts and breast tumor-derived MDA-MB-231 cells. We first demonstrated that tumor cells activated fibroblasts by releasing an unidentified factor. Activation appeared to involve up-regulation of podoplanin in dermal fibroblasts, which plays a major role in the effects these fibroblasts have on tumor cells. In turn, activated fibroblasts released one or more soluble signals, tentatively identified as matrix metalloproteinases and the cytokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, which accelerated the rate of tumor cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence by four-fold. HPMF activation involved a different gene expression pattern but nevertheless, similar to CC-NHDFs, MMP secretion was markedly increased along with the rate and extent of coalescence in breast cancer cells. We further demonstrated that activated fibroblasts also accelerate aggregation and coalescence by traversing a 3D Matrigel environment and physically acting as scaffolds for cancer cells. We hypothesize that the reciprocal signaling system, in conjunction with the direct interaction of activated fibroblasts with cancer cells, as revealed in the 3D Matrigel environment and described here, may reflect interactions between breast cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts in vivo. These interactions may ultimately facilitate tumor growth and coalescence in early stages of tumorigenesis in field cancerized tissue and may also reflect cancer cell-fibroblast interactions that do not involve coalescence during tumor development.Supporting informationReferencesStromal contributions to the carcinogenic processThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerIonizing radiation-mediated premature senescence and paracrine interactions with cancer cells enhance the expression of syndecan 1 in human breast stromal fibroblasts: the role of TGF-betaSyndecan-1 in breast cancer stroma fibroblasts regulates extracellular matrix fiber organization and carcinoma cell motilityMatrix crosslinking forces tumor progression by enhancing integrin signalingMatrix metalloproteinases as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in human cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts: orchestrating the composition of malignancyFibroblast surface-associated FGF-2 promotes contact-dependent colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion through FGFR-SRC signaling and integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(5)-mediated adhesionFibroblast-led collective invasion of carcinoma cells with differing roles for RhoGTPases in leading and following cellsA mechanically active heterotypic E-cadherin/N-cadherin adhesion enables fibroblasts to drive cancer cell invasionReciprocal activation of prostate cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemnessA Computer-Assisted 3D Model for Analyzing the Aggregation of Tumorigenic Cells Reveals Specialized Behaviors and Unique Cell Types that Facilitate Aggregate CoalescenceMelanoma cells undergo aggressive coalescence in a 3D Matrigel model that is repressed by anti-CD44Fibroblast-derived CXCL12 promotes breast cancer metastasis by facilitating tumor cell intravasationThe hallmarks of CAFs in cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts induce metalloprotease-independent cancer cell invasion of the basement membraneCancer associated fibroblasts: An essential role in the tumor microenvironmentField cancerization in oral stratified squamous epithelium;

        "content": "BACKGROUND Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key factors in malignant tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. However, the effect of CAFs autophagy on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells is not clear. In this study, the growth effect of TNBC cells regulated by CAFs autophagy was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS CAFs were obtained from invasive TNBC tumors and identified by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining assay.

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

        "title": "Experimental generation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts.",
        "content": "Carcinomas are complex tissues comprised of neoplastic cells and a non-cancerous compartment referred to as the 'stroma'. The stroma consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a variety of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes and leukocytes (1-3). The tumour-associated stroma is responsive to substantial paracrine signals released by neighbouring carcinoma cells. During the disease process, the stroma often becomes populated by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) including large numbers of myofibroblasts. These cells have previously been extracted from many different types of human carcinomas for their in vitro culture. A subpopulation of CAFs is distinguishable through their up-regulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression(4,5). These cells are a hallmark of 'activated fibroblasts' that share similar properties with myofibroblasts commonly observed in injured and fibrotic tissues (6). The presence of this myofibroblastic CAF subset is highly related to high-grade malignancies and associated with poor prognoses in patients. Many laboratories, including our own, have shown that CAFs, when injected with carcinoma cells into immunodeficient mice, are capable of substantially promoting tumourigenesis (7-10). CAFs prepared from carcinoma patients, however, frequently undergo senescence during propagation in culture limiting the extensiveness of their use throughout ongoing experimentation. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a novel technique to experimentally generate immortalised human mammary CAF cell lines (exp-CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts, using a coimplantation breast tumour xenograft model. In order to generate exp-CAFs, parental human mammary fibroblasts, obtained from the reduction mammoplasty tissue, were first immortalised with hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme, and engineered to express GFP and a puromycin resistance gene. These cells were coimplanted with MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells expressing an activated ras oncogene (MCF-7-ras cells) into a mouse xenograft. After a period of incubation in vivo, the initially injected human mammary fibroblasts were extracted from the tumour xenografts on the basis of their puromycin resistance (11). We observed that the resident human mammary fibroblasts have differentiated, adopting a myofibroblastic phenotype and acquired tumour-promoting properties during the course of tumour progression. Importantly, these cells, defined as exp-CAFs, closely mimic the tumour-promoting myofibroblastic phenotype of CAFs isolated from breast carcinomas dissected from patients. Our tumour xenograft-derived exp-CAFs therefore provide an effective model to study the biology of CAFs in human breast carcinomas. The described protocol may also be extended for generating and characterising various CAF populations derived from other types of human carcinomas.",

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

        "title": "A C-terminal fragment of adhesion protein fibulin-7 inhibits growth of murine breast tumor by regulating macrophage reprogramming.",
        "content": "Recent reports have shown that a C-terminal fragment of adhesion protein Fibulin7 (Fbln7-C) could demonstrate both antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. The current study investigated the potential of Fbln7-C as a modulator of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and its potential as an anticancer therapeutic. Our in\u00a0vitro data show that Fbln7-C could inhibit the tumor cell line (MDA-MB-231) supernatant-induced reprogramming of human monocytes into immunosuppressive TAMs as indicated by higher expression of pERK1/2 and pSTAT1 molecules, and reduced expression of CD206 protein and arg1, ido, and vegf transcripts in monocytes cultured in the presence of Fbln7-C compared to controls. Interestingly, Fbln7-C-treated macrophages retained their altered phenotype even after the removal of Fbln7-C, and their secretome demonstrated anticancer activities. Finally, in a 4T1-induced murine breast tumor model, intravenous administration of Fbln7-C, following the appearance of measurable tumors, significantly reduced the growth and weight of the tumors. Detailed phenotypic analysis of the infiltrated monocyte/macrophage populations (F480<sup+</sup Ly6G<sup-</sup CD11b<sup+</sup ) at day 23 postinduction showed a higher percentage of inflammatory monocytes (F480<sup+</sup Ly6C<suphi</sup CD11b<sup+</sup ) and a delayed differentiation into anti-inflammatory TAMs as evident by their reduced levels of CD206 expression. In conclusion, the above data suggest that Fbln7-C could regulate the tumor environment-induced macrophage reprogramming and has the potential for cancer therapeutics.",
