        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

        "content": "It is established that the interaction between microenvironment and cancer cells has a critical role in tumor development, given the dependence of neoplastic cells on stromal support.

Taken together, these data provide new insights into the role of miR-9 as an important player in the cross-talk between cancer cells and stroma.Tumorigenesis is not considered anymore a tumor cell-autonomous mechanism triggered by accumulation of somatic aberrations, but fostered by a two-way interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment.Cancer cells are indeed integrated in a biologically complex stroma, composed of different cell types (such as immune system components, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes) as well as extracellular matrix (ECM), which originates the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

        "content": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease for which prognosis and treatment strategies are largely governed by the receptor status (estrogen, progesterone and Her2) of the tumor cells.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis.

One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+. The 18 significantly enriched pathways share 66 unique genes with 61 of those upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC.Q-RT-PCR validation of individual gene expression data in CAFsTo confirm differential gene expression levels in the three breast cancer subtypes, Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC, we selected 6 genes (ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1, FZD1) with significantly different levels of expression based on our microarray studies and validated their expression levels by qRT-PCR. Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs.

(E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

Data are shown as relative expression of the miRNAs. Standard deviations were calculated on technical duplicates. The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008). (C) Histograms of qRT-PCR results showing the basal expression levels of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 in NFs compared with CAFs. Data are shown as relative expression of miRNAs folded on NFs. Standard deviations were calculated with replicates from two independent experiments performed on four different primary NF cells (pt. #1, #2, #3, and #4) and four different primary CAF cells (pt. #81, #82, #87, and #89). The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027). (D) Representative images of the EXOmotif analysis with MDS software showing a short motif (3\u20135 nt) in miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 sequences, predictive of their active loading into exosomes. (E) Western blot showing overexpression of FAP, Caveolin-1, and MCT4 proteins in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs compared with control (scrambled [Scra]) after 72 h. (F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0049. (E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

MRI of albumin-GdDTPA was used to characterize macromolecular fluid transport in vivo and SHG microscopy was used to quantify collagen 1 (Col1) fiber morphology. COX-2 downregulation decreased Col1 fiber density and altered macromolecular fluid transport. Immunohistochemistry identified significantly fewer activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in low COX-2 expressing tumors.

SHG microscopy identified significantly higher Col1 fiber density in COX-2 overexpressing tumors with an increase of CAFs. These data expand upon the roles of COX-2 in shaping the structure and function of the ECM in primary and metastatic tumors, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in modifying the number of CAFs in tumors that may have contributed to the altered ECM.",

These data expand upon the roles of COX-2 in shaping the structure and function of the ECM in primary and metastatic tumors, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in modifying the number of CAFs in tumors that may have contributed to the altered ECM.INTRODUCTIONCyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an active mediator of the inflammatory response of cells. Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, shown in Figure 4A, demonstrate the reduction in colonization and establishment of pulmonary metastasis following COX-2 downregulation.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G. Representative \u03b1-SMA immunoblots obtained from an MDA-MB-231 and a Clone 13 tumor are presented in Figure 5H and demonstrate the decrease of \u03b1-SMA expression following COX-2 downregulation.Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from A.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

Thus, PFD has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.INTRODUCTIONCollagen, mainly produced by fibroblasts, is the most abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in the stroma. Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

        "content": "BACKGROUND Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key factors in malignant tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. However, the effect of CAFs autophagy on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells is not clear. In this study, the growth effect of TNBC cells regulated by CAFs autophagy was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS CAFs were obtained from invasive TNBC tumors and identified by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining assay. CAFs were co-cultured with TNBC cells, and migration and invasion were evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts. TNBC cells growth was detected by MTT assay, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by CAFs was evaluated by Western blot assay. RESULTS CAFs were identified by the high expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) protein. Autophagy-relevant Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels in CAFs were higher than those in NFs (P&lt;0.05). TNBC cells migration, invasion, and proliferation levels were significantly improved in the CAFs-conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) group, compared with the other 3 groups (P&lt;0.05). TNBC cells vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05). Further study indicated b-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels, which are the key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05).

However, the effect of CAFs autophagy on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells is not clear. In this study, the growth effect of TNBC cells regulated by CAFs autophagy was evaluated.Material/MethodsCAFs were obtained from invasive TNBC tumors and identified by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining assay. CAFs were co-cultured with TNBC cells, and migration and invasion were evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts. TNBC cells growth was detected by MTT assay, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by CAFs was evaluated by Western blot assay.ResultsCAFs were identified by the high expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) protein. Autophagy-relevant Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels in CAFs were higher than those in NFs (P<0.05). TNBC cells migration, invasion, and proliferation levels were significantly improved in the CAFs-conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) group, compared with the other 3 groups (P<0.05). TNBC cells vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). Further study indicated \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels, which are the key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05).ConclusionsOur data demonstrated CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and CAFs autophagy can induce TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.BackgroundBreast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women throughout the world. According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

        "title": "Elucidating the fate of nanoparticles among key cell components of the tumor microenvironment for promoting cancer nanotechnology.",
        "content": "Successful integration of nanotechnology into the current paradigm of cancer therapy requires proper understanding of the interface between nanoparticles (NPs) and cancer cells, as well as other key components within the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as normal fibroblasts (FBs) and cancer-associated FBs (CAFs). So far, much focus has been on cancer cells, but FBs and CAFs also play a critical role: FBs suppress the tumor growth while CAFs promote it. It is not yet known how NPs interact with FBs and CAFs compared to cancer cells. Hence, our goal was to elucidate the extent of NP uptake, retention, and toxicity in cancer cells, FBs, and CAFs to further understand the\u00a0fate of NPs in a real tumor-like environment. The outcome of this would guide designing of NP-based delivery systems to fully exploit the TME for a better therapeutic outcome. We used gold nanoparticles as our model NP system due to their numerous applications in cancer therapy, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

So far, much focus has been on cancer cells, but FBs and CAFs also play a critical role: FBs suppress the tumor growth while CAFs promote it. It is not yet known how NPs interact with FBs and CAFs compared to cancer cells. Hence, our goal was to elucidate the extent of NP uptake, retention, and toxicity in cancer cells, FBs, and CAFs to further understand the\u00a0fate of NPs in a real tumor-like environment. The outcome of this would guide designing of NP-based delivery systems to fully exploit the TME for a better therapeutic outcome. We used gold nanoparticles as our model NP system due to their numerous applications in cancer therapy, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 were chosen as cancer cell lines. For this study, a clinically feasible 0.2\u00a0nM concentration of GNPs was employed. According to our results, the cancer cells and CAFs had over 25- and 10-fold higher NP uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. Further, the cancer cells and CAFs had over 30% higher NP retention compared to FBs. There was no observed significant toxicity due to GNPs in all the cell lines studied. Higher uptake and retention of NPs in cancer cells and CAFs vs FBs is very important in promoting NP-based applications in cancer therapy. Our results show potential in modulating uptake and retention of GNPs among key components of TME, in an effort to develop NP-based strategies to suppress the tumor growth. An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs. Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. In panel a, the first column shows the distribution of lysosomes while the second column shows the merged image of lysosomes plus MTs.

The cells were first incubated with NPs over a time period of 24\u00a0h followed by another incubation for 24\u00a0h in fresh media to determine the extent of NP retention. b Redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell among two daughter cells during cell division. c Confocal images of HeLa (first row), FBs (second row), and CAFs (third row) displaying distribution of GNPs (first column; marked in red), MT network (second column, marked in green), and merged image (third column) corresponding to GNPs and MTs. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease which can be divided into immunohistochemical and molecular subtypes. The most frequent subtype expresses estrogen receptor (ER\u03b1), which can be targeted by anti-estrogens or aromatase inhibitors. Less frequent subtypes are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2)-positive breast cancers, which are vulnerable to Her2 inhibitors and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which are devoid of ER\u03b1, Her2 and progesterone receptor. For TNBCs, selective drugs are still not available. Breast cancers also exhibit intratumoral heterogeneity, part of which is caused by cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs have been linked to tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance.Drug resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. Different mechanisms leading to drug resistance are known. Endocrine resistance often involves the activation of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and/or Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK-1)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase-1)/ERK1/2 pathways, which are both able to activate ER\u03b1 independently of estrogen. The activation of these pathways can occur intrinsically or extrinsically. By interacting with breast cancer cells, stromal cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), can extrinsically activate these pathways and thereby promote the development of endocrine resistance.Recently, the authors demonstrated that MSCs and CAFs are able to induce resistance to the selective ER\u03b1 down-regulator, fulvestrant, in breast cancer cells by increasing the expression of the atypical inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB (I\u03baB) family member B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 3 (Bcl-3). Bcl-3, whose expression can also be induced by the withdrawal of estrogen, has been associated with higher metastatic activities in breast cancer. Bcl-3 is a potent activator of the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway, a pathway that has also been linked to endocrine resistance. In addition, the activity of Bcl-3 is positively regulated by the PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathways.The stromal cell-induced increase in Bcl-3 expression has been shown to be causally linked to a prior downregulation of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) level. A main function of IGFBP5 is to regulate the availability of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) for the interaction of this growth factor with its receptor, IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). In addition, IGFBP5 can also act without targeting IGF. Such an IGF-independent effect may be responsible for the regulation of Bcl-3 by IGFBP5. There is evidence to indicate that IGFBP5 plays an important role in breast cancer progression and that it is of prognostic value. Notably, IGFBP5 expression is higher in ER\u03b1-positive tumors.The stromal cell-induced desensitization of MCF-7 cells to fulvestrant does not require direct contact between stromal and breast cancer cells; however, it can be fully recapitulated by conditioned medium (CM) derived from stromal cells. CM can also mimic all effects of stromal cells on signaling pathways, namely the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), PI3K/AKT and the Ras/Raf/MEK-1/ERK1/2 pathways, as well as on the expression of proteins, namely Bcl-3, integrin \u03b21, IGF1R and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). This suggests that factors secreted by stromal cells are responsible for the desensitization to fulvestrant and for alterations in protein expression.Interleukin (IL)-6 belongs to the IL-6 family of cytokines. By forming a complex with the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and glycoprotein 130 (gp130), IL-6 activates JAKs. Downstream targets of JAKs are STATs, MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways, whereby the activation of STAT3 is a major cellular response to IL-6. Soluble IL-6R allows trans signaling. In trans signaling, an extracellular complex of IL-6 and IL-6R activates gp130-expressing targets cells. Since, in this case, the target cells do not need to express IL-6R by themselves, the number of cells that can respond to IL-6 increases. IL-6 is primarily secreted by leukocytes to regulate hematopoietic cells involved in inflammation and adaptive immunity. In addition, IL-6 acts on non-hematopoietic cells, such as fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells and may, when deregulated, lead to the development of certain diseases, such as fibrosis. Epithelial cells benefit from the survival-promoting activity of IL-6, helping damaged epithelia to be repaired. Intriguingly, IL-6 also supports the survival of premalignant epithelial cells, which links IL-6 to cancer progression. Strikingly, IL-6 has often been found to be upregulated in the bodily fluids of cancer patients and activated STAT3 is a common feature of numerous cancer types. IL-6 has been associated with inflammation and multidrug resistance in cancer. In breast cancer, IL-6 has been found to induce resistance to the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and the Her2 antibody trastuzumab and has been shown to contribute to chemoresistance. Evidence for a role of IL-6 in maintaining cancer stem cell activity in breast cancer has also been provided. IL-6 is able to increase the cancer stem cell population and, along with it, the expression of crucial stemness factors, such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4). IL-6 also induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which promotes cancer stem cell activity. The ability of IL-6 to induce drug resistance has been found to be linked to its stemness-supporting activity. IL-6 has further been shown to be involved in a cytokine network between MSCs, CSCs and non-CSC breast cancer cells. Based on the assumption that CSCs are the likely drivers of metastasis, it is noteworthy that IL-6 serum levels are higher in breast cancer patients with metastatic disease.Given its multiple effects on cancer progression, IL-6 has been discussed as a promising target for drug intervention in breast cancer. IL-6- or IL-6R-directed drugs are already routinely used for treatment of diseases with excessive IL-6 expression, such as inflammatory arthritis and could therefore be made available for cancer treatment. Since the major source of IL-6 are MSCs and CAFs in cancer, in this study, the potential of recombinant IL-6 to mimic the effects of stromal cells on fulvestrant resistance and on the expression and activities of those proteins which may be involved therein was examined.This study demonstrates that IL-6 is the mediator of the majority of the CAF-CM-induced effects on protein expression and on STAT3 phosphorylation, although not on PI3K/AKT pathway activity. It is further demonstrated that IL-6 participates in CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in 3D spheroid cultures, but not in 2D adherent cultures. In addition, it was found that IL-6 likely contributes to the growth-inhibitory effects of CAF-CM on ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells.Materials and methodsCell lines and agentsMCF-7, BT474, T47D, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which were authenticated by SNP analysis (Genolytic), were propagated in RMPI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Biotech). The MCF-7 subline, AnD5 cells, and the generation of CAF-CM have been described previously. One part CAF-CM was mixed with four parts fresh medium/serum (20% CAF-CM). Recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) was purchased from PeproTech and reconstituted in water as recommended by the provider. Fulvestrant (LKT Laboratories) was added to the cells at a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M.RNA interferenceThe p110\u03b1 (pik3ca)-specific siRNA siPIK (5\u2032-GUACAGGACUUCCGAAGAA-3\u2032), siBcl-3 (5\u2032-UGGUC UUCUCUCCGCAUCA-3\u2032) and the control siRNA and Firefly luciferase-siRNA siLuc (5\u2032-CUUACGCUG AGUACUUCGA-3\u2032), were purchased from Eurofins MWG. Transfections were performed by electroporation by using a Bio-Rad GenePulserX-Cell as previously described. Briefly, following electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulserX-cell (250 V, 800 \u00b5F), cells were seeded on a 10 cm culture dish and incubated for 3 days to allow the siRNA to downregulate its specific target.Western blot analysisProtein extractions and western blot analysis were carried out as previously described. Blots were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. The primary antibodies used are listed below.

Anti-CAIX antibody was kindly provided by Professor S. Pastorekova (Slovak Academy of Sciences). Secondary antibody conjugates (anti-rabbit/anti-mouse horse radish peroxidase, 1:2,000, #7074 and #7076) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Protein loading was examined by either staining proteins with Coomassie Blue (Blue G, SERVA Electrophoresis) or with Fast Green (MERCK). Incubations with either staining agent were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Antibodies against housekeeping proteins were not used for this purpose, since they are not reliable markers for protein loading.ImmunocytochemistryImmunocytochemical analysis of formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded 3D cell aggregates was carried out as previously described.Growth/survival assaysIn 3D and high-density 2D cultures, the mass of living cells was determined by an ATP-based assay (Vialight Plus kit, Lonza). For spheroid formation in 3D suspension cultures, the cells were incubated in ultra-low attachment 96-well microplates (Corning) at a density of 5\u00d7103 cells/well. For incubation in high-density 2D cultures, the cells were seeded at a density of 1\u00d7104 per well (24-well plate). The cells were then exposed to fulvestrant and/or CAF-CM or left untreated for 3-7 days as indicated. Following the removal of the growth medium, the 2D-cultured cells were lysed by the addition of a mixture of 100 \u00b5l PBS and 50 \u00b5l lysis buffer to each well. After mixing 50 \u00b5l of the lysate with 50 \u00b5l luciferase stock solution, the luciferase activity was measured in a Sirius luminometer (Berthold). For measuring ATP in 3D-cultured cells, 50 \u00b5l of the lysis buffer was directly added to the 100-\u00b5l culture medium the cells were grown in. For examining cell growth in low-cell density 2D cultures, the cells were seeded at a density of 3\u00d7104 cells per \u00f8 10 cm dish. Following treatment either the average size (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells) or the average cell number (SKBR3 cells) of individual colonies was determined. Colony size was measured using an AxioCAM MRc5 camera and the AxioVision R 4.5 imaging software (Zeiss) as described previously. For each condition, 50 randomly selected colonies were examined. For measuring spheroid/aggregate size in 3D suspension cultures, the area occupied by the spheroid or aggregate was measured. Of note, some cell lines did not form regularly shaped spheroids. Instead they formed randomly clusters (T47D) or discs (MDA-MB-231, SKBR3) (data not shown).Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative (q)PCR were carried out as described previously. Briefly, NucleoSpin RNA II (Macherey & Nagel) and Superscript II (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis, respectively. Following the addition of ABsolute qPCR SYBR-Green Fluorescein Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), qPCRs were run on a Bio-Rad iCycler and analyzed using iQ5 Optical System software version 2.1. Relative RNA levels of genes were calculated by the comparative Cq (2\u2212\u2206\u2206Cq) method using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and hypoxanthine-guanine phos-phoribosyltransferase (HPRT) as reference genes for normalization. Primers for Bcl-3, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)18, GAPDH, HPRT, IGFBP5, kinesin family member 12 (KIF12), kelch like family member 4 (KLHL4), Kallikrein-11 (KLK11), RAB30, receptor activity modifying protein 3 (RAMP3), selenoprotein P (SEPP1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor III (TGFBR3), transmembrane protein 26 (TMEM26), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UGT2B15) and yippee like 1 (YPEL1) were as previously described. The primers used for the detection of aldehyde dehydroge-nase 1 family, member A1 (ALDH1A1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family, member A1 (ALDH3A1) and STAT3 were as follows: ALDH1A1 (forward 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, CAAAGAAGC TGCCGGGAAA and reverse 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, TCCAAGCTCCAGGGT CACC), ALDH3A1 (forward 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, GTCCCTGAGACCACG GAGC and reverse 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, CCCGTGTACAGGATATGGTCG) and STAT3 (forward 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, GGACAATATCATTGACCTTGT GAAAA and reverse 5\u2032\u21923\u2032, CTTCGTTCCAAAGGGCCAG).Antibody arrayTo identify proteins that are abundant in CAF-CM, the Human Obesity Antibody Array I (RayBiotech) was used, containing 62 different antibodies. Among the proteins, which can be detected by this array are a number of ILs, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and TGF\u03b2. The incubation of this array with CAF-CM and control medium/serum was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions.Statistical analysesData obtained from colony growth assays were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by pairwise comparison with Bonferroni-corrected test. All other statistical analyses were carried out by using one-way ANOVA. The Bonferroni correction was applied for post-hoc analysis. A P-value <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsIL-6 is a major mediator of the effects of CAF-CM on protein expression and phosphorylation in MCF-7 cellsBy selecting an antibody array that was able to detect the majority of factors reported to be secreted by CAFs, it was found that, in the CAF-CM preparations in this study, IL-6 was the most prominent component among other proteins [IL-8, CC-chemokine ligand (CCL)2 and CCL7, and tissue inhibitor of metallopro-teinases (TIMP)1 and TIMP3] (Fig. 1A).Of note, SDF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN)\u03b3 could not be detected in considerable amounts. rhIL-6 was used to determine to which extent IL-6 is able to mimic the effects of CAF-CM on MCF-7 cells.rhIL-6 was as potent as CAF-CM in increasing Bcl-3 RNA and protein expression (Fig. 1B and C). Of note, several bands of Bcl-3 were visible in the western blot analysis, which likely represent Bcl-3 isoforms with a different phosphorylation status. In the CAF-CM-treated MCF-7 cells, Bcl-3 expression is linked to IGFBP5 downregulation, and in rhIL-6-treated cells, STAT3 has been shown to drive Bcl-3 expression. In this study, rhIL-6 was found to be as capable as CAF-CM in activating STAT3 (Fig. 1C) and, above that, even increased STAT3 mRNA expression (Fig. 1B). However, at 0.1 \u00b5g/ml, it failed to mimic the downregulating effect of CAF-CM on IGFBP5 expression (Fig. 1B). This suggests that, in contrast to CAF-CM, rhIL-6 upregulates Bcl-3 in MCF-7 cells through STAT3 and not through IGFBP5.The authors have previously reported that Bcl-3 modulates the expression of IGF1R and CAIX. The levels of both could be increased in a similar manner by CAF-CM and rhIL-6 (Fig. 1C). Another potential target of Bcl-3 is c-Myc, a mitogenic oncoprotein. After it was confirmed that c-Myc expression also depends on Bcl-3 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D), the effect of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 on the c-Myc level was examined. However, neither agent interfered with c-Myc expression (Fig. 1C) suggesting that the basal level of Bcl-3 is sufficient to maintain high c-Myc levels. It was also determined whether Bcl-3 modulates the expression of p50 (NF-\u03baB), a Bcl-3-binding transcription factor through which Bcl-3 activates transcription. However, p50 expression was not affected by Bcl-3 knockdown (Fig. 1D).Integrin \u03b21, another protein whose expression can be upregulated by CAF-CM, also exhibited a higher level in the presence of rhIL-6 (Fig. 1C). In addition, the RNA expression levels of the cancer stem cell markers, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 were increased in a similar manner by CAF-CM and rhIL-6 (Fig. 1E). However, rhIL-6 failed to increase AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In addition, it was not able to down-regulate a number of genes to the same extent as CAF-CM (Fig. 1F), whereby two of these genes (TMEM26 and YPEL1) exhibited no response to rhIL-6 at all. Of note, the 11 genes depicted in Fig. 1F shared the ability to react to inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway by increasing their expression (data not shown). This links the weaker effect of rhIL-6 on these genes to its inability to induce AKT phosphorylation.On the whole, these data demonstrate that rhIL-6 recapitulates a number of the effects of CAF-CM on RNA and protein expression in MCF-7 cells. However, it fails to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and has a weaker or no effect on a number of PI3K/AKT-responsive genes.rhIL-6 partly mimics CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in 3D, but not in 2D culturesThe PI3K/AKT pathway and Bcl-3 play important roles in CAF-induced anti-estrogen resistance. The PI3K/AKT pathway is able to phosphorylate ER\u03b1 and restore ER\u03b1 activity in the presence of anti-estrogens. In addition, it increases Bcl-3 protein stability and fosters its nuclear localization. As demonstrated above, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 increased the expression of Bcl-3, but only CAF-CM was able to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. We therefore examined whether rhIL-6 is capable of inducing fulvestrant resistance to the same extent as CAF-CM. To this end, MCF-7 cells were grown in the absence and presence of fulvestrant for 5 or 7 days at high or low density, respectively, and the mass of viable cells was determined by an ATP/luciferase-based assay (high density) or average colony size (low density). In the absence of fulvestrant, CAF-CM negatively affected growth in high-density cultures and had a slight positive effect in low-density cultures, whereas rhIL-6 had no effect (Fig. 2A and B). In the presence of fulvestrant, CAF-CM potently increased cell mass both in low- and high-density cultures, whereas rhIL-6 had no effect at the concentration of 0.01 and 0.1 \u00b5g/ml, and slightly increased cell mass at 0.3 \u00b5g/ml. This indicates that, in contrast to CAF-CM, rhIL-6 is unable to induce fulvestrant resistance.To examine whether CAF-CM and rhIL-6 differently affect proliferation and/or apoptosis in the presence of fulvestrant, the proliferation marker Ki67 and the apoptosis marker cPARP, which is the 25-kDa fragment of cleaved PARP1, were analyzed. Both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 increased the Ki67 levels in the fulvestrant-treated MCF-7 cells and, along with this, abrogated the expression of cytoplasmic p21Waf1/Cip1, a marker of both senescence and apoptosis resistance. Unlike CAF-CM, rhIL-6 increased cPARP-1 expression (Fig. 2C). This suggests that, in contrast to CAF-CM, rhIL-6 exhibited pro-apoptotic activity in MCF-7 cells, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study demonstrating that, at 5 ng/ml, rhIL-6 induced apoptosis-linked DNA laddering in these cells. Along with the increased expression of cPARP-1, the level of ABCG2, a multidrug resistance protein acting as drug efflux pump, was found to be reduced (Fig. 2C). This suggest that the pro-apoptotic activity of rhIL-6 is linked to a decline in the activity of ABCG2.Subsequently, it was determined whether the PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in this process by using siRNA directed to the PI3K subunit p110\u03b1. This siRNA completely abolished p110\u03b1 expression and markedly reduced AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). It also potently increased cPARP-1 expression and downregulated ABCG2 expression. These data suggest that the PI3K/AKT pathway is important for protecting MCF-7 cells against apoptosis and that ABCG2 plays a role in this process (Fig. 2D).These data suggest that, in the presence of fulvestrant, CAF-CM increased cell growth by stimulating proliferation. While rhIL-6 shares with CAF-CM the ability to stimulate proliferation, it also acts in a pro-apoptotic manner, which seems to lead to a steady state between proliferation and apoptosis and therefore prevents growth. The data further suggest that the pro-apoptotic activity of rhIL-6 is linked to ABCG2 downregulation and its inability to raise AKT activity.The effects of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 on the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to fulvestrant in 3D spheroid cultures were then analyzied for two reasons. These culture conditions more likely resemble in vivo conditions and cells in 3D cultures react differently to external stimuli as compared to cells in 2D cultures. In 3D cultures, MCF-7 cells form regularly-shaped spheroids (Fig. S1A). Spheroid formation is complete after three days of incubation. Thereafter, the spheroids become larger (Fig. S1A), which coincides with cell growth (Fig. S1B) and a high expression of Ki67 (Fig. S1C). Later, growth ceases, possibly since cells die in the center of the spheroid, as indicated by cPARP-1 expression. In the presence of fulvestrant, cells form smaller spheroids, which later on appear disheveled (Fig. S1A). These morphological changes were accompanied by progressive cell death (Fig. S1B).To assess the effects of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 on spheroid-assembled MCF-7 cells, cell growth and spheroid size were measured. In the absence of fulvestrant, neither CAF-CM nor rhIL-6 affected cell growth (Fig. 3A). In the presence of fulvestrant, both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 increased cell mass; however, the effect of CAF-CM was more potent (3.5- vs. 1.9-fold). The difference became even more pronounced, when the incubation time was extended to 11 days (5.5- vs. 2.4-fold) and 14 days (10- vs. 3.4-fold) (Fig. 3B). Spheroid size was increased by CAF-CM both in absence and presence of fulvestrant; however, rhIL-6 only weakly enlarged the spheroids in the absence of fulvestrant and had no effect on spheroid size in the presence of fulvestrant (Fig. 3C).These experiments were repeated with the AnD5 cell line. This MCF-7 subline forms smaller spheroids and develops them more rapidly than the parental MCF-7 cell line (data not shown). The results obtained with the AnD5 cells were similar to those obtained with the parental cell line, with the exception that, in the absence of fulvestrant, rhIL-6 affected spheroid size more potently than CAF-CM and that, in the presence of fulvestrant, rhIL-6 increased spheroid size, although still not as efficiently as CAF-CM (Fig. 3D and E).The examination of the Ki67 and cPARP-1 levels after 7 days of fulvestrant treatment revealed that the levels of both proteins were higher in the 3D cultures compared to their levels in 2D cultures, and that CAF-CM and rhIL-6 reduced the levels of both proteins (Fig. 3F). While the effects of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 were similar on cPARP-1 expression, rhIL-6 had a more potent suppressive effect on Ki67 expression. These data suggest that, in 3D cultures, CAF-CM- and rhIL-6-induced fulvestrant resistance is based on their anti-apoptotic activities. The residual proliferative activity in the presence of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 may as well play a role. If so, the more potent suppressive effect of rhIL-6 on Ki67 expression may explain why rhIL-6 is not as effective as CAF-CM in inducing fulvestrant resistance. The examination of p-AKT and ABCG2 expression revealed that the anti-apoptotic effect of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 was not linked to these proteins. In the presence of CAF-CM and rhIL-6, the levels of both proteins were rather reduced (Fig. 3F). This suggests that, in 3D cultures, the PI3K/AKT pathway and ABCG2 are not involved in the regulation of apoptosis.Collectively, these data suggest that CAF-CM induces fulvestrant resistance in 2D and 3D cultures through different mechanisms, one by inducing proliferation, the other by inhibiting apoptosis, respectively. To a large extent, rhIL-6 was able to mimic the protective effect of CAF-CM against fulvestrant in 3D cultures, likely due to the fact that it was as able as CAF-CM to block apoptosis. By contrast, in 2D cultures, rhIL-6 shares with CAF-CM a mitogenic effect; however, by also acting in a pro-apoptotic manner under these culture conditions, it prevents cell growth and instead induces a steady-state between cell proliferation and cell death.rhIL-6 fails to induce fulvestrant resistance also in other ER\u03b1-positive cell lines in 2D culturesThe question of whether the findings that were obtained with the MCF-7 cells are also applicable for other ER\u03b1-positive cell lines was then examined. The BT474 and T47D cell lines were selected, which have been previously found by the authors to respond to CAF-CM, both in terms of protein expression patterns and survival in the presence of fulvestrant. Both cell lines exhibited an increased STAT3 phosphorylation in response to CAF-CM and rhIL-6 (Fig. 4A and B). In the BT474 cells, both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 upregulated Bcl-3 expression, although the effect of rhIL-6 was more potent. In the T47D cells, only rhIL-6 increased the Bcl-3 level. In neither case was a gain in the Bcl-3 level accompanied by a substantial change in c-Myc or IGF1R expression; nor did CAIX expression increase to detectable levels (data not shown). In addition, neither CAF-CM nor rhIL-6 upregulated the level of integrin \u03b21. Different effects of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 were observed on cytoplasmic p21, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. In both cell lines, rhIL-6, but not CAF-CM, substantially increased the level of cytoplasmic p21, while CAF-CM, but not rhIL-6, decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Importantly, as was observed with the MCF-7 cells, rhIL-6 also failed to mimic the positive effect of CAF-CM on AKT phosphorylation in BT474 cells.As was previously demonstrated, CAF-CM increased the resistance of BT474 and T47D cells to fulvestrant in 2D cultures (Fig. 4C and D), although these effects were not as potent as with the MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A). Again, with rhIL-6, these results could not be reproduced.In the absence of fulvestrant, CAF-CM had no effect on BT474 cell growth, while it potently increased the growth of T47D cells. By contrast, rhIL-6 failed to mimic the growth-stimulatory effect on the T47D cells and even had a growth-inhibitory effect on BT474 cells (Fig. 4C and D).In 3D cultures, neither CAF-CM nor rhIL-6 had a substantial effect on the growth of these cells (Fig. 4C and D). The spheroid size of the BT474 cells and aggregate size of the T47D cells (which do not form uniformly shaped spheroids) were affected by CAF-CM and rhIL-6 in a similar manner. Both agents slightly reduced the average spheroid size of the BT474 cells and increased the average aggregate size of the T47D cells (Fig. 3E and F).Collectively, these data demonstrate that rhIL-6 also fails to mimic the growth-stimulatory effects of CAF-CM on BT474 and T47D cells in 2D cultures. In the case of the BT474 cells, this failure may again be linked to the inability of rhIL-6 to increase AKT phosphorylation. Additionally, cytoplasmic p21 may play a role, which was highly upregulated in both BT474 and T47D cells in response to rhIL-6, but not in response to CAF-CM.rhIL-6 mimics the majority of the growth-inhibitory effects of CAF-CM on ER\u03b1-negative cell linesFurthermore, ER\u03b1-negative cell lines (triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and Her2-positive SKBR3 cells) were analyzed. The lack of ER\u03b1 expression in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells and Her2 expression in SKBR3 cells were confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. S2). Of note, the MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a high basal activity of STAT3 (Fig. S2), which is the consequence of their high production of IL-6 and an IL-6/IL-6 receptor autocrine loop. This cell line also exhibited the highest basal level of integrin \u03b21 of all the cell lines tested (Fig. S2). However, due to their ER\u03b1 deficiency, no effect of fulvestrant on MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells was expected; for reasons of completeness, the analyses were also carried out in the presence of fulvestrant. In addition, since these cells grow rapidly, growth in 2D cultures was examined at a low density and either the average size of individual colonies (MDA-MB-231) or the average number per colony (SKBR3) was determined.Despite the high basal levels of p-STAT3 and integrin \u03b21 in the MDA-MB-231 cells, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 were able to further upregulate the levels of both proteins in these cells (Fig. 5A). By contrast, none of the two agents induced Bcl-3 expression and both even negatively affected the expression of IGF1R and CAIX. In SKBR3 cells, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 similarly upregulated STAT3 phosphorylation, Bcl-3 and IGF1R expression, while only CAF-CM enhanced integrin \u03b21 expression (Fig. 5B). In both cell lines, CAF-CM increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and decreased total ERK1/2 levels, while having no effect on AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 5A and B). The effects on ERK1/2 were mimicked by rhIL-6 in the SKBR3, but not in the MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, in the SKBR3 cells, rhIL-6 increased AKT phosphorylation. Of note, in both cell lines, CAF-CM, as well as rhIL-6, potently decreased the expression of c-Myc.Cell growth analysis revealed that both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 reduced the growth of MDA-MB-231and SKBR3 cells in 2D cultures (Fig. 5C and D). With the SKBR3 cells, but not with the MDA-MB-231 cells, this growth-inhibitory effect was also observed in 3D cultures (Fig. 5E and F). In addition, the average sizes of the 3D SKBR3 cell aggregates decreased significantly, while the aggregates of the MDA-MB-231 cells, which form discs rather than spheroids (data not shown), remained unaltered (Fig. 5G and H). In general, the negative effects of CAF-CM on the growth of MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells were more potent than the corresponding effects of rhIL-6.Collectively, these data demonstrate that rhIL-6 also mimics the majority of the effects of CAF-CM on protein expression in MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells. rhIL-6 also shares the growth-inhibitory effects of CAF-CM on both cell lines, without being as potent as CAF-CM. The decline in growth activity may be linked to the potent reduction in c-Myc expression as inflicted by both agents in these cell lines. In the case of the MDA-MB-231 cells, additionally, the decline in IGF1R and CAIX may play a role here. c-Myc, IGF1R and CAIX have been reported to be key players driving MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.DiscussionThe findings of this study suggest that IL-6 is not only a major component of CAF-CM, but also mimics the majority of the effects of CAF-CM on protein expression in both ER\u03b1-positive and -negative breast cancer cells (Fig. 6). In agreement with previous reports that IL-6 is a classical activator of STAT3, this study found that an increase in the p-STAT3 level was a common response of all tested breast cancer cell lines to rhIL-6. This effect was also observed with CAF-CM, suggesting that IL-6 is the general mediator of the STAT3-activating effect of CAF-CM. In most cases, rhIL-6 also shared with CAF-CM the ability to increase the expression of Bcl-3. Bcl-3 gene expression can be upregulated by rhIL-6 through STAT3, which may suggest that the increase in STAT3 activity was responsible for the increase in Bcl-3 expression in response to rhIL-6 and CAF-CM. However, in MCF-7 cells, the CAF-CM-induced decrease in IGFBP5 expression was shown to be the major mediator of Bcl-3 upregulation. Since rhIL-6 had no effect on IGFBP5 expression at a lower concentration, it is likely that CAF-CM and rhIL-6 induced Bcl-3 expression through two different mechanisms: CAF-CM by decreasing IGFBP5 expression, rhIL-6 by upregulating STAT3 activity. A downregulatory effect of CAF-CM on the IGFBP5 level was as also observed in BT474 and SKBR3 cells (data not shown). RNA interference confirmed that, also in these cells, the downregulation of IGFBP5 caused an increase in Bcl-3 protein expression (data not shown). Of note, in MDA-MB-231 cells, IGFBP5 RNA was barely detectable (data not shown) and basal STAT3 activity was the highest of all cell lines tested (Fig. S2). In these cells, neither CAF-CM nor rhIL-6 increased the Bcl-3 level.There were a number of other effects on protein expression shared by CAF-CM and rhIL-6, which may be related to their abilities to increase the p-STAT3 and Bcl-3 levels. Among these is IGF1R, a major driver of the PI3K pathway in MCF-7 cells and important for ER\u03b1-driven proliferation. In MCF-7 cells, Bcl-3 mediates the CAF-CM-induced expression of IGF1R. In SKBR3 cells, the IGF1R levels were also found to increase along with Bcl-3. However, in BT474 and T47D cells, a higher Bcl-3 expression did not coincide with higher IGF1R levels and, in the MDA-MB-231 cells, the IGF1R level even decreased in response to CAF-CM and rhIL-6, while no change in Bcl-3 expression was observed. This suggests that IGF1R expression is regulated by CAF-CM and rhIL-6 in an either Bcl-3-dependent or -independent manner. In tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells, the IGF1R promoter has been reported to be regulated by c-Myc. Hence, in MDA-MB-231 cells, the CAF-CM- and rhIL-6-induced loss of c-Myc may be responsible for the decrease in the IGF1R level. However, in the other cell lines tested, c-Myc expression was not associated with IGF1R expression. In MCF-7 cells, c-Myc expression was closely linked to Bcl-3 expression (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with the observation that, in colon cancer cells, Bcl-3 increases the expression and stability of c-Myc. However, the CAF-CM- and rhIL-6-induced increase in Bcl-3 expression did not lead to a higher expression of c-Myc (Fig. 1C), arguing against the possibility that in MCF-7 cells, Bcl-3 increased IGF1R expression indirectly through c-Myc.Another protein, whose expression was modulated by both CAF-CM and rhIL-6 was CAIX, which is important for the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In MCF-7 cells, Bcl-3 and, to a minor extent, also STAT3 contribute to the CAF-CM-induced increase in CAIX expression. The classical activator of CAIX expression is hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). CAF-CM has been shown to induce the expression of HIF1\u03b1 in MCF-7 cells under normoxic conditions, although not as potently as the hypoxia mimetic, CoCl2. NF-\u03baB, through which Bcl-3 activates genes, and STAT3 have been shown to be able to upregulate HIF1\u03b1 expression under normoxic conditions. In MDA-MB-231 cells, in which CAF-CM and rhIL-6 increased the p-STAT3 level, while leaving the Bcl-3 level unaffected, CAIX expression decreased (Fig. 5A). This suggests that additional factors are involved in CAIX regulation. In the other cell lines tested, the CAIX levels were not detectable neither in the absence of CAF-CM or rhIL-6 (Fig. S2), nor in their presence (data not shown).Integrin \u03b21, a protein linked to anti-estrogen resistance, also exhibits a higher expression in response to CAF-CM and rhIL-6 in some of the breast cancer cell lines tested (MCF-7, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231). The expression of both the slower migrating, N-glycosylated and the rapidly migrating, unglycosylated forms of integrin \u03b21 were similarly affected, suggesting that CAF-CM and rhIL-6 did not modulate the glycosylation of this protein. The regulation of integrin \u03b21 expression is not yet well understood. In MCF-7 cells, neither STAT3 nor Bcl-3 affect integrin \u03b21 expression positively and exhibit a rather downregulatory effect. The transcription factor, forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1), has recently been identified as a potential regulator of integrin \u03b21 expression in TNBC cells. However, in SKBR3 cells, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 decreased the level of FoxM1 (data not shown), while CAF-CM increased the level of integrin \u03b21, and rhIL-6 did not affect integrin \u03b21 expression. This argues against an involvement of FoxM1 in CAF-CM- and rhIL-6-induced integrin \u03b21 expression. Another candidate that potentially may have contributed to the increase in integrin \u03b21 expression is TMEM26. Not only does its knockdown increase integrin \u03b21 expression, but CAF-CM also downregulated its expression in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, an inverse association between TMEM26 and integrin \u03b21 levels was also found with BT474 and SKBR3 cells (data not shown). Hence, a downregulated TMEM26 level may have contributed to the stimulatory effect of CAF-CM on integrin \u03b21 expression. However, it does not explain the effect of rhIL-6 on integrin \u03b21, as rhIL-6 fails to downregulate TMEM26 (Fig. 1F).Although rhIL-6 mimicked almost all the effects of CAF-CM on protein expression, in most cases, it failed to recapitulate the effects of CAF-CM on ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation. In the BT474 and T47D cells, CAF-CM decreased and, in the MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells, it increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while, only in the SKBR3 cells, rhIL-6 was able to mimic the effect of CAF-CM. Likewise, CAF-CM, but not rhIL-6 increased the phosphorylation of AKT in the MCF-7 and BT474 cells. The failure of rhIL-6 (10 ng/ml) to modulate AKT and ERK1/2 activities in breast cancer cell lines has also been demonstrated by others.The failure to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway in MCF-7 and BT474 cells coincided with the inability of rhIL-6 to mimic CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in 2D cultures. The authors demonstrate that, in MCF-7 cells, rhIL-6 induced apoptosis in 2D cultures, probably by downregulating ABCG2 expression, and that the apoptotic activity and ABCG2 expression are under the control of the PI3K/AKT pathway. This suggests a connection between the failure of rhIL-6 to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and its pro-apoptotic activity. Apart from stimulating apoptosis, rhIL-6 is as capable as CAF-CM in stimulating proliferation in the presence of fulvestrant. Hence, a likely scenario is that CAF-CM induces fulvestrant resistance by promoting proliferation, while rhIL-6 fails to foster growth in the presence of fulvestrant by causing a steady-state between cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. The PI3K/AKT pathway is not only important in regulating apoptosis, but is also able to phosphorylate ER\u03b1, thereby rendering the activity of ER\u03b1 independent of estrogen. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT pathway can activate Bcl-3. These PI3K/AKT pathway-related activities may as well play a role in CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance.CAF-CM also promoted the growth of T47D cells in the presence of fulvestrant. T47D cells differ from the MCF-7 and BT474 cells, as they exhibit a higher growth activity in response to CAF-CM also in the absence of fulvestrant. The effect on cell growth in the absence of fulvestrant was more potent than that in its presence. Neither of these effects were mimicked by rhIL-6. These findings are supported by those of other studies. It was previously demonstrated that co-cultures with CAFs upregulated the proliferation of T47D cells, whereas, at concentrations between 20 pg/ml and 100 ng/ml, rhIL-6 downregulated growth of these cells. The p-AKT levels did not differ in the presence of CAF-CM and rhIL-6 (Fig. 4B), ruling out the possibility that the PI3K/AKT pathway was involved. In addition, both agents upregulated the phosphorylation of STAT3, a factor that T47D cells rely on for growth, in a similar manner. However, unlike CAF-CM, rhIL-6 potently increased the expression of cytoplasmic p21 and Bcl-3 (Fig. 4B). The activation of NF-\u03baB, as can be induced by Bcl-3, can lead to the reduced growth of T47D cells. In addition, IKK\u03b2 (I\u03baB kinase \u03b2), which activates NF-\u03baB by triggering its dissociation from I\u03baB, was found to cause the cytoplasmic p21 level in breast cancer cells to rise. Since cytoplasmic p21 is associated with cellular senescence, rhIL-6 may have induced senescence through a Bcl-3/cytoplasmic p21 route. It should be noted that cytoplasmic p21 has also been linked to apoptosis protection. However, the data of this study suggest that, at least in MCF-7 cells, the cytoplasmic p21 level is an indicator of proliferative and not apoptotic activity (Fig. 2C).By summarizing the data on the growth activity of ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells in 2D cultures, it becomes clear that all the growth-promoting effects of CAF-CM could not be recapitulated by rhIL-6 and must therefore be mediated by a CAF-CM component other than IL-6. By contrast, in 3D cultures, the growth-stimulatory effects of CAF-CM on MCF-7 and AnD5 cells in the presence of fulvestrant were mimicked by rhIL-6 to a large extent (Fig. 3A and B). Of note, the mechanism through which CAF-CM induces fulvestrant resistance differs between 2D and 3D cultures. In 2D cultures, CAF-CM promotes growth in the presence of fulvestrant by stimulating proliferation, whereas in 3D cultures this is achieved by the inhibition of apoptosis. rhIL-6 shares with CAF-CM the anti-apoptotic effect and is therefore also able to induce fulvestrant resistance in 3D cultures. Hence, there are opposite effects of rhIL-6 on apoptosis in 2D vs. 3D cultures, whereby the regulation of apoptosis in 2D cultures is dependent on the PI3K/AKT pathway, whereas, in 3D cultures, it is not. In contrast to 3D-cultured MCF-7 cells, neither the 3D-cultured BT474 nor 3D-cultured T47D cells responded to CAF-CM or rhIL-6 by a considerable change in growth activity. These data again emphasize that responses to external factors can be quite different between 2D and 3D cultures.In contrast to the ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cell lines tested, the ER\u03b1-negative cell lines MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 responded to CAF-CM in 2D cultures by a decrease in growth activity. The CAF-CM-treated SKBR3 cells also exhibited a lower growth activity in 3D cultures. Depending on the concentration used, all these growth-inhibitory actions were more or less mimicked by rhIL-6. Notably, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 potently decreased c-Myc expression in both cell lines. Since c-Myc is essential for cell cycling in MDA-MB-231, as well as in SKBR3 cells, the loss of c-Myc is the likely reason for the reduced growth activity as inflicted by CAF-CM and rhIL-6. The loss of c-Myc does not seem to be connected to Bcl-3. In the SKBR3 cells, the c-Myc levels were decreased, while the Bcl-3 levels were increased; in the MDA-MB-231 cells, the c-Myc levels decreased, while the Bcl-3 levels remained unaltered. In the MDA-MB-231 cells, the loss of c-Myc may be related to the decrease in the levels of IGF1R and CAIX, which are both important for MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.Differences in the reactivity to CAF-CM and rhIL-6 in terms of growth activity in 2D as opposed to 3D culture have also been found with MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrating that ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells are react differently between 2D and 3D cultures. This was also shown in a previous study, in which the B-Raf inhibitor, RAF-265, was found to be more effective in inhibiting the growth of 3D-cultured than that of 2D-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells. Likewise, the growth inhibition of SKBR3 cells by the Her2 inhibitor, lapatinib, has been shown to be more pronounced in 3D as compared to 2D cultures.Although the stroma is the major source of IL-6 expression in primary breast cancers, breast cancer cells also secrete IL-6, whereby TNBC cells produce the highest amounts. For instance, MDA-MB-231 cells secrete a ~1,000-fold greater amount of IL-6 than MCF-7 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells use the endogenous production of IL-6 to stimulate a IL-6/IL-6 receptor loop for keeping STAT3 activity high. In fact, their p-STAT3 level was the highest of all p-STAT3 levels in the breast cancer cell lines we have tested (Fig. S2). Nevertheless, CAF-CM and rhIL-6 were able to further increase STAT3 activity (Fig. 5A) suggesting that the amount of IL-6 they secrete does not reach the maximum concentration for optimal stimulation of STAT3 activity. The inhibition of the IL-6/IL-6R loop or STAT3 activity has been shown to lead to the decreased proliferation and the increased apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand, the addition of rhIL-6 to MDA-MB-231 cells has been demonstrated to decrease proliferation, while not having any effect on apoptosis. In this study, rhIL-6 also acted growth-inhibitory on MDA-MB-231 cells in 2D cultures. As discussed above, the downregulation of the c-Myc, IGF1R and CAIX levels may be the reasons for the rhIL-6-induced growth inhibition.IL-6 plays a role in tissue remodeling and can stimulate both reprogramming and senescence. In this study, at the concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 \u00b5g/ml, rhIL-6 was found to recapitulate the effects of CAF-CM on the expression of CSC-related ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1E). This is in agreement with earlier findings indicating that 0.1 \u00b5g/ml rhIL-6 increased ALDEFLOUR activity in SUM159 cells.In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that, in all cell lines tested, CAF-CM component IL-6 mediates CAF-CM-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and the majority of the changes in protein expression pattern. However, almost all CAF-CM-induced alterations in ERK1/2 and AKT activities are not mediated by IL-6. The failure to activate AKT seems to be linked to its inability to mimic CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in common adherent 2D cultures. Yet, it likely mediates CAF-CM-induced fulvestrant resistance in 3D cultures. This suggests that the ability of IL-6 to participate in the acquisition of fulvestrant resistance depends on culture conditions. Notably, IL-6 acts in a pro-apoptotic manner in 2D and in an anti-apoptotic manner in 3D cultures. Differences in the apoptotic activities of cells in 2D and 3D cultures have also been found by others. Tissue architecture has a potent effect on the behavior of cells. One reason may be that cells become polarized in 3D cultures, but not in 2D cultures. Given that cells in tissues are organized in three and not in two dimensions, the data obtained with 3D cultures are more likely to resemble the in vivo situation. The Kaplan-Meier-Plotter (http://kmplot.com/analysis/index.php?p=service&default=true) allows the assessment in-silico of the importance of IL-6 on the outcome of patients based on its mRNA level. Such a survival analysis of 494 ER\u03b1+/Her2\u2212 breast cancer samples for IL-6 mRNA revealed no significant difference in relapse-free survival at high and low levels of IL-6 mRNA (data not shown). However, IL-6 mRNA levels may not necessarily reflect the levels of secreted IL-6. Therefore, future studies on primary ER\u03b1+ breast cancer samples, comparing low and high IL-6 protein expresser, are warranted.Supplementary DataFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsAD performed most of the growth assays and RNA interference experiments and carried out Western blot analyses.

Effective targeting of mechanisms that control the loss of ER dependency in breast cancer remains elusive. We analyzed breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the largest component of the tumor microenvironment, as a factor contributing to ER expression levels and anti-endocrine resistance.Experimental DesignTissues from ER+ breast cancer patients were analyzed for the presence of CD146 positive (CD146pos) and CD146 negative (CD146neg) fibroblasts. ER dependent proliferation and tamoxifen sensitivity were evaluated in ER+ tumor cells co-cultured with CD146pos or CD146neg fibroblasts. RNAseq was used to develop a high confidence gene signature that predicts for disease recurrence in tamoxifen treated patients with ER+ breast cancer.ResultsWe demonstrate that ER+ breast cancers contain two CAF subtypes defined by CD146 expression. CD146neg CAFs suppress ER expression in ER+ breast cancer cells, decrease tumor cell sensitivity to estrogen, and increase tumor cell resistance to tamoxifen therapy. Conversely, the presence of CD146pos CAFs maintains ER expression in ER+ breast cancer cells and sustains estrogen-dependent proliferation and sensitivity to tamoxifen. Conditioned media from CD146pos CAFs with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells is sufficient to restore tamoxifen sensitivity. Gene expression profiles of patient breast tumors with predominantly CD146neg CAFs correlate with inferior clinical response to tamoxifen and worse patient outcomes.ConclusionsOur data suggest that CAF composition contributes to treatment response and patient outcomes in ER+ breast cancer, and should be considered a target for drug development.INTRODUCTIONEstrogen receptor (ER) expression is the primary prognostic and predictive biomarker for patients with breast cancer. Its presence defines the luminal breast cancer subtypes (A and B) and delineates candidacy for anti-endocrine therapy which significantly improves survival outcomes. Breast cancers, however, commonly display high heterogeneity of ER expression, where individual cells within a tumor vary in their level of ER expression. The fact that a majority of ER+ tumors contain a range of cells from ER\u2212 to ER+, led to development of the Allred score for ER positivity based on overall ER presence and intensity in an individual tumor. Clinical presentation of only one percent ER positive tumor cells justifies the use of adjuvant anti-endocrine therapy. However, development of anti-endocrine resistance remains a major clinical problem that occurs in 40 percent of patients. Recurrent tumors do not typically demonstrate complete loss of ER expression, rather they show a combination of both loss of ER expression and loss of ER growth dependency.To date, it remains unclear, how individual tumors maintain a balance of ER positive and negative cells. Intrinsic cellular factors do not fully explain the range of ER expression within a single tumor; therefore, logic suggests the tumor microenvironment (TME) has a role in this phenomenon. In fact, expression patterns of proteins in the stromal/fibroblast component of breast cancer, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA and PDGFRB), CXCL1, CXCL14, CD10, and CD36, are prognostic of patient outcomes. Furthermore, Park et. al. describes a stromal-derived profile consisting of seven stromal expressed proteins that is predictive of breast cancer molecular subtypes. Fibroblasts represent the most abundant cell type within the stroma and we reasoned that in luminal breast cancer, the tumor microenvironment (TME) contains functionally and phenotypically distinct fibroblast subtypes that influence tumor cell ER expression and response to anti-endocrine therapy.The purpose of this study was to first examine if subtypes of CAFs exist in luminal breast cancer and to then determine if they have important functional roles in dictating responsiveness of breast cancer cells to estrogen. Intrinsic stromal fibroblasts are known to be heterogeneous in both gene expression and function, which has made it difficult to define functional subsets. CD146 (MCAM) was reported as a stromal cell surface marker that defined fibroblast subtypes in the hematopoietic stem cell-niche. Given that all tissue stromal fibroblasts are mesenchymal in origin, we speculated that breast fibroblasts also contain both CD146pos and CD146neg fibroblasts, and that CD146 expression would define functional subsets of CAFs. Here, we describe a hierarchical organization in tumor-associated stroma, based upon CD146 expression, with implications for therapeutic sensitivity and disease progression.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell cultureThe human MCF-7 (p53 wildtype, ER-positive, luminal subtype) breast cancer cell lines were cultured in Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and HEPES buffer at 37 \u00b0C with a 5% CO2/95% atmospheric air. Human stromal cell lines HS5 and HS27A and epithelial tumor cells UCD12 and T47D cells were grown in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 5% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS), nonessential amino acids, Penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). CD146 CAF subtypes are genetically and functionally akin to HS27a and HS5 fibroblasts, however, unlike the HS27a and HS5 fibroblast cell lines, our CAFs have a limited number of passages before they become senescent. Therefore, we used HS27a and HS5 fibroblasts in most of our studies and used our primary CAFs to verify our findings in a select set of studies. Unless otherwise indicated by the designation of CAF, described studies utilized HS27a and HS5 fibroblasts. MCF-7, UCD12 and T47D were provided by the lab of Carol Sartorius. The lab of Manoj Pillai provided HS27a and HS5 cell lines. All cell lines used in this manuscript were authenticated by STR profile testing in May 2016. For additional methods on cell culture drug line treatments and proliferation assays please refer to the supplemental methods.Generation of Cancer Associated FibroblastsNormal and tumor tissue samples were collected from patients at the University of Colorado Denver in accordance with an IRB approved protocol. The tissue was collected into ice cold DMEM/F12 until ready for processing. Finely minced tissue was placed in collagenase digestion buffer (DMEM/F12 with 10 mM Hepes, 2% BSA, 5 \u00b5g/ml Insulin, 100 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 300 U/ml collagenase IV (1 mg/ml) and 100 U/ml hyaluronidase) overnight on a rotator at 37 \u00b0C. Digestion buffer was used at a volume of 10 ml per 1 g of tissue. Following digestion, any oil layer was gently aspirated off (common to normal breast tissue) and the sample was filtered through a 100 \u00b5m mesh into a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuged 1000 \u00d7 g, at 4 \u00b0C for 5 minutes to pellet the cells. The cell pellet was re-suspended in 10 ml of PBS and filtered through a 40 \u00b5m mesh into a new 50 ml conical tube. Differential centrifugation was used to enrich for stromal cell types. A slow speed, 80 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C for 4 minutes, was used to pellet epithelial cells. The supernatant was collected for a second centrifugation step, 100 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet was enriched for stromal cells and was re-suspended in DMEM/F12, 5% FBS, Insulin, NEAA, and Pen/Strep and cultured in standard cell culture flasks. Non-adherent and dead cells were washed out with PBS at 4 hours, 24 hours and twice weekly media changes until the cultures reached confluence in a 3 0mm dish. Confluent cell cultures were immortalized with E6E7 virus as described previously. Following selection of transduced cells with G418, limiting dilution and clonal selection was used to generate CD146pos and CD146neg fibroblast subtypes from each patient sample. CD146 expression was verified by flow cytometry. For flow additional methods on flow cytometry, please refer to the supplemental methods.Animal ExperimentsAll animal experiments were conducted in an AAALAC accredited facility at the University of Colorado Denver under an IACUC approved protocol. MCF-7 tumors labeled with ZS-green were established by injecting 1 \u00d7 10^6 cells into the mammary fat pad of NOD scid gamma (NSG) female mice. HS27a or HS5 cells were mixed with the tumor cells at a 1:1 ratio (N = 3\u20136 mice per stroma subtype). Tumors were allowed to grow for at least 5 weeks prior to removal. All tumors received continuous estrogen supplementation throughout the study, as previously described. For the tamoxifen study, MCF-7 cells mixed with HS5 or HS27a cells were randomized to either the right or left mammary fat pad of each mouse. The tumors were established for 3 weeks and then the mice were randomized into groups receiving peanut oil or 80 mg/kg 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. Treatments were given 3 times per week by intraperitoneal injection for 8 weeks.Human SamplesHuman samples were collected under an approved COMIRB protocol from a phase II clinical trial performed at University of Colorado consisting of 80 patients with stage II and III newly diagnosed breast cancer (both ER+ and ER\u2212). The trial was designed to assess cellular heterogeneity in patients receiving neo-adjuvant therapy. Available samples from patients with ER+ disease were used. A board certified pathologist reviewed histology. The tamoxifen outcome data comes from the following GEO record number GSE6532. For additional gene expression and immunocytochemistry methods please refer to the supplemental methods.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was completed using R-package software for the gene expression data sets and with GraphPad Prism 6 analytical software (La Jolla, CA) for all other experiments. For single comparisons we used unpaired two-tailed t-tests with assumptions of parametric distribution Gaussian distribution and equal standard deviations. For multiple comparisons we used ordinary one-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey multiple comparisons tests. Significance was set at p < 0.05. All cell culture experiments consisted of at least N = 4 or more and were repeated at least once using the same ER+ breast cancer cell type, different ER+ subtype. Our in vivo experiment consisted of N = 3\u20136 animals per stromal subtype. Outliers were considered to be 2 standard deviations from the mean and data are presented as mean +/\u2212 the standard error of the mean.RESULTSCD146 expression identifies subtypes of normal and cancer associated stroma in breast tissueTo determine the prevalence of CD146pos/CD146neg cells in breast cancer-associated stroma, we used dual immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for CD146 and for the strongly associated stromal marker vimentin. The stromal component of ER+ breast cancer-associated patient tissues contains mixed populations of CD146pos and CD146neg cells (Fig. 1A). In fact, the staining revealed striking differences in the intensity and frequency of CD146pos stroma between patient samples. We quantified these differences by dual immunofluorescence (IF) staining for CD146 and vimentin in a cohort of 17 patient samples previously scored by a board certified pathologist for ER expression.In the clinical practice of pathology, cellular morphology is the standard in identifying tumor cells and is the basis of pathologic diagnosis. Stromal cells are long and spindly, and bland in appearance with small nuclei and fine chromatin. In contrast, breast tumor cells are easily identified as large pleomorphic cells with anisonucleosis, characterized by coarse chromatin and prominent nuclei. We stained our patient cohort for tumor cell marker cytokeratin 8/18 (CK8/18) and stromal marker vimentin to verify that tumor cells were maintaining a distinct epithelial phenotype. All of our patient samples contained only CK8/18 positive, vimentin negative tumor cells and the stromal compartment was characterized by spindle shaped, vimentin positive, CK8/18 negative cells (SFig. 1). Based on this combination of morphologic characteristics and supporting immunohistochemical pattern, we determined that it was possible to distinguish tumor cells from stromal cells with high confidence.Based on our cohort size, we used Allred 6 as our cutoff point for determining if there was a potential relationship between CD146 expression in the stromal component of breast cancer and the Allred score for ER expression. Ten samples had Allred scores greater than 6 (high ER) and seven had scores less than or equal to 6 (lower ER). We quantified our IF staining by determining the percentage of vimentin+/CD146pos and vimentin+/CD146neg stroma. For this analysis, we manually excluded tumor epithelial cells (vimentin negative, CK8/18 positive) and obvious vessel structures (vimentin positive). Patients who had an Allred score greater than 6 had a mean of 68% CD146pos stroma, whereas Allred scores equal to or less than 6 had a mean of 18% CD146pos stroma (Fig. 1B). The range of vimentin+/CD146pos stroma cells in our 17 samples was 2\u201387% (Fig. 1C\u2013D). These data imply that threshold expression for breast tumor ER is correlated to the CD146pos fibroblast subtype.We next tested normal breast tissue and cancer-associated breast tissue for the presence of CD146pos and CD146neg stromal subtypes. Primary human cancer associated and normal breast stroma cells were isolated from 11 ER+ breast cancer patient samples, enriched for fibroblasts and established as primary cell lines using immortalization and clonal expansion. We determined stromal cell enrichment by flow analysis and found that our stromal isolation method resulted in a highly enriched fibroblast fraction (95% VIMpos+, 92% FSP1+), and was depleted of epithelial (3.9% CD136pos) and endothelial (CD31pos) cells, with minimal contribution of possible pericytes (0% CD31pos/NG2pos, 4.4% FSP1neg/NG2pos) (SFig. 2A-B, SFig. 3A). We further validated that our cells expressed vimentin by gene expression and immunofluorescence staining (SFig. 3B\u2013D). Our method utilized several wash steps to deplete the sample of poorly adherent hematopoietic cells. Finally, we flow sorted our clonal cell lines for expression of CD146, and we identified two subtypes of normal fibroblasts (NBFs) and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in both normal breast and breast cancer associated patient tissues (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the breast TME is composed of at least two CAF subtypes, which can be identified according to CD146 expression and are common to both normal breast stroma and breast cancer-associated stroma. Patients with lower ER expression based on Allred scores (\u2264 6) have significantly decreased expression of CD146pos CAF compared to patients with high ER (Allred scores > 6).CD146pos CAFs are functionally and phenotypically akin to CD146pos fibroblasts found in normal bone marrowWe next used the cobble stone area assay (CSA) to determine if the CAF subtypes we derived from human ER+ breast cancer tissue had similar functionality to the CD146pos and CD146neg bone marrow derived HS27a and HS5 fibroblasts. A description of this assay can be found in the supplemental methods. MNC/HS27a co-cultures had 5.8-fold more CSA than MNC/HS5 co-cultures (SFig. 4A\u2013B). Similar to the results with normal fibroblasts, MNCs co-cultured with CD146pos compared to CD146neg CAF cells had significantly more CSA (3-fold greater) (SFig. 4A\u2013B). These results show that our CAFs promote equivalent MNC behavior as normal bone marrow-derived fibroblasts when stratified by CD146 expression.To determine if CAF cell isolates were phenotypically akin to HS27a and HS5 normal fibroblasts we used gene expression signatures and hierarchical clustering analysis. The gene expression signatures of CD146neg CAFs demonstrated significant similarity by clustering in the same family with normal HS5 fibroblasts (SFig. 4C). Likewise, CD146pos CAFs clustered with HS27 fibroblasts (SFig. 4C). Our CAF cell lines have similar expression levels for genes associated with activated fibroblasts, including pro-collagen type 1 alpha, smooth muscle actin and fibroblast activation protein alpha (STable 1). These data support the assertion that our human cancer derived stromal subtypes have a fibroblast gene signature that is similar to the human bone marrow-derived HS27a and HS5 normal fibroblasts.CAF subtypes differentially influence ER expression in breast cancer cellsTo pursue a functional role for CAFs in distinguishing tumor characteristics, we compared the phenotype and growth of ER+ breast cancer cells (BCCs) grown in conjunction with the two fibroblast subtypes. ER+ MCF-7 BCCs were co-cultured with CD146pos and CD146neg fibroblasts in estrogen depleted media for 5 days and stained for ER using immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A). Cytokeratin 18 (CK18) was used to positively identify tumor cells. ER expression was significantly higher in MCF-7 cells when they were co-cultured with CD146pos fibroblasts (74% vs. 37% ER+ cells, Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed when we co-cultured BCCs with our primary CAF subtypes (SFig. 5A).To assess if CAF subtypes would similarly affect ER in tumors, we grew ER+ MCF-7 cells co-implanted with the fibroblast subtypes as xenografts. A 1:1 mixture of MCF-7 cells was injected with CD146pos or CD146neg fibroblasts. Tumors were established and allowed to grow with estrogen supplementation for 4 weeks prior to collection. Tumor sizes at 4 weeks were not significantly different between fibroblast subtypes. We co-stained the tumors with ER plus CK8/18 to identify tumor cells. MCF-7 xenograft tumors mixed with CD146pos fibroblasts expressed higher levels of ER (Fig. 2C) compared to MCF-7/CD146neg mixed tumors (38% vs. 24%, Fig. 2D). These data show that CD146neg fibroblasts drive decreased ER expression in BCCs and suggest one possible mechanism for stroma-induced development of anti-endocrine resistance.ER+ breast cancer cells use ER growth dependent pathways when stimulated by CD146pos fibroblastsTo determine if CD146 positive or negative fibroblasts influence estrogen dependent proliferation in ER+ breast cancer cells, we used co-culture and conditioned media experiments. We analyzed proliferation rates using a total protein assay or live cell imaging using Incucyte Zoom. MCF-7 cell cultures were grown in estrogen-starved conditions for 72 hours prior to treatment with conditioned media (CM). RT-PCR analysis verified ER expression, in absence of estrogen, was decreased simply by treating MCF-7 cells with conditioned media from CD146neg fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). In vehicle treated samples after 72 hours, conditioned media from both CD146pos and CD146neg fibroblasts increased MCF-7 BCC proliferation 5-fold (Fig 3B). Treatment with estrogen (17\u03b2-estradiol, E2) significantly increased proliferation of BCCs grown in unconditioned or CD146pos CM (2.9-fold and 1.3-fold respectively) (Fig. 3B). Estrogen did not alter proliferation of BCCs treated with CD146neg CM (Fig. 3B). Tamoxifen significantly inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of BCCs in unconditioned or CD146pos fibroblasts CM by over 7-fold (Fig. 3B). However, proliferation of BCCs with CD146neg fibroblast CM was not significantly changed with tamoxifen (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained using co-cultures of MCF-7 with fibroblasts instead of CM, and with two other ER+ BCCs, UCD12 (SFig 5B) and T47D (SFig 5C\u2013D). These data demonstrate that ER+ BCCs influenced by CD146pos fibroblasts remain estrogen responsive and anti-estrogen sensitive; however, influence from CD146neg fibroblasts renders ER+ BCCs estrogen unresponsive and tamoxifen insensitive.Since our data indicated that CD146 fibroblast subtypes influence BCC response to tamoxifen, we next tested the response of tamoxifen resistant MCF-7/TAMR-1 (TAMR-1) cells to tamoxifen when grown under the influence of CD146pos or CD146neg fibroblasts. TAMR-1 cells are a tamoxifen resistant derivative of MCF-7 BCCs. We cultured TAMR-1 cells in unconditioned or conditioned media from CD146pos or CD146neg fibroblasts and treated with 10 nM E2 alone or with 100 nM 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Tamoxifen). Tamoxifen treatment had no effect on proliferation of BCCs in unconditioned or CD146neg fibroblasts CM (Fig 3C). However, TAMR-1 cells cultured in CD146pos fibroblast CM had significantly decreased proliferation with tamoxifen (29% compared to control) (Fig 3C), suggesting TAMR-1 cells gained sensitivity to tamoxifen.To substantiate our in vitro results we established MCF7 tumors mixed with CD146 positive or negative fibroblasts in the mammary fat pad of NSG mice and then treated the mice with tamoxifen. Animals were given a 1 mg subcutaneous estrogen pellet that remained in place throughout the experiment. Tumors were established for 3 weeks and then randomized into groups receiving TAM or vehicle (average tumor size = 54 mm3) (Fig. 4A). Two weeks post tamoxifen treatment, MCF-7/CD146neg tumors were significantly larger than MCF-7/CD146pos fibroblasts (p < 0.001; 326 \u00b1 67 mm3 versus 73 \u00b1 39 mm3 respectively). Vehicle treated MCF-7/CD146neg fibroblasts were significantly larger than MCF-7/CD146pos tumors by 7 weeks (p < 0.001; 151 \u00b1 84 mm3 versus 151 \u00b1 84 mm3 respectively). MCF-7/CD146neg mixed tumors did not respond to tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 4A\u2013B). However, tamoxifen treated MCF-7/CD146pos tumors were significantly smaller than vehicle treated MCF-7/CD146pos tumors (p < 0.03; 0.4 mm3 versus 0.17 mm3) (Fig. 4A\u2013B). Although MCF-7/CD146pos tumors were significantly smaller than MCF-7/CD146neg tumors, all of the tumors contained dense regions of CK8/18 positive tumors with vimentin positive stroma present throughout (SFig. 6A). These data support the hypothesis that fibroblast subtypes can influence tamoxifen sensitivity of ER+ BCCs.ER+ breast cancer cells activate receptor tyrosine kinase pathways when stimulated by CD146neg fibroblastsEvidence suggests that early development of endocrine resistance involves cross-talk between ER, EGFR/HER2 and IGF1R pathways. Therefore, we next determined if growth of ER+ BCCs influenced by CD146neg fibroblasts were sensitive to EGFR inhibition. We co-cultured GFP labeled MCF-7 BCCs with CD146pos or CD146neg fibroblasts in serum reduced media (2.5% FBS) for 48 hours and then treated the cells with the EGFR specific inhibitor gefitinib (10 \u00b5M). Proliferation was unchanged for MCF-7 cells co-cultured with CD146pos fibroblasts and treated with gefitinib, whereas it was reduced by 60% in gefitinib treated BCCs co-cultured with CD146neg fibroblasts (Fig 5A).To further examine this effect, we performed a dose response experiment using CM from MCF-7 cells or CM from fibroblasts and treatment with 0\u201325 \u00b5M gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor) or 0\u201350 \u00b5g/mL trastuzumab (HER2 specific inhibitor). Proliferation was measured with a total protein assay. At the maximum concentration of gefitinib (2.5 \u00b5M), MCF-7 cells had a growth reduction of 17%, 25% and 46% when grown in CM from MCF-7 cells, CD146pos fibroblasts or CD146neg fibroblasts respectively (Fig. 5B). Trastuzumab treatment caused MCF-7 growth reduction between 3\u201312% in MCF-7 CM, 15% in CD146pos CM and 24\u201331% in CD146neg CM (Fig. 5C). Western blot analysis of MCF7 cells treated with CM from MCF-7, CD146pos or CD146neg fibroblasts demonstrates that MCF7 cells grown in all conditions express a small amount of EGFR (SFig. 6B) and that only CM from the fibroblasts result in detectable phosphorylated EGFR protein (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that CD146pos fibroblasts stimulate EGFR and CD146neg fibroblasts stimulate both EGFR and HER2 in ER+ BCCs.To further examine which tyrosine kinase pathways might be active in CM cultures, we used a human phospho-RTK array panel. As previously demonstrated by western blot, MCF-7 cells plus CD146pos or CD146neg CM were positive for phospho-EGFR, but not phospho-ERBB2/HER2 (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, the cultures grown with CD146neg fibroblasts were also positive for phosphorylated IGF1R, which has been implicated in promoting tamoxifen resistance. Our data suggest that BCCs influenced by CD146neg fibroblasts escape estrogen dependent proliferation and exhibit tamoxifen resistance through activation of EGFR, HER2 and IGF1R.CD146 expression in fibroblasts correlates with patient outcomesPrevious analysis by Finak et al demonstrated that the gene signature from the total stromal component of breast cancer patients accurately identifies normal versus cancer tissue and predicts patient outcomes. We compared the gene signatures of HS27a, HS5, CD146pos CAFs and CD146neg CAFs to the published gene expression data of normal and breast cancer-associated stroma. We verified considerable overlap of expressed annotated genes in all four cell types (HS27a, HS5, CD146pos and CD146neg) with the gene set used to identify breast stromal origin and to generate predictions of breast cancer patient outcomes (128 of the 163 stromal genes identified by Finak et. al.. We then used the 128 identified stromal genes in our data set to determine if CD146pos or CD146neg fibroblasts clustered with normal breast stroma or breast cancer-associated stroma in the published data set.Because HS5 cells and our CD146neg CAFs cluster in a single family, and HS27a cells cluster with our CD146pos CAFs, we pooled the genes from each subtype together for our comparison. The gene expression profile from HS5 (CD146neg) fibroblasts and our breast cancer patient-derived CD146neg CAFs aligned with the Finak et. al. gene profile pattern for breast cancer associated stroma, whereas a CD146pos gene profile from HS27a or our CD146pos CAFs aligned with normal breast associated stroma (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, CD146neg CAFs predicted poor/mixed clinical outcomes for patients with ER+ breast cancer compared to CD146pos CAFs, which were aligned with better clinical outcomes (Fig. 6B). These data demonstrate that CD146 expression is a distinguishing characteristic of stromal fibroblasts in the normal and diseased breast that mimics the fibroblast hierarchy present in the hematopoietic system, demarcates normal vs. tumor associated stroma, and is predictive of disease outcomes.CAF induced gene expression signature predicts breast cancer recurrence in patients treated with tamoxifenWe used RNA-seq to determine gene expression changes that occur in BCCs with fibroblast subtypes we co-cultured MCF-7 cells with CD146pos and CD146neg fibroblasts. Analysis revealed that MCF-7 cells co-cultured with CD146neg fibroblasts had increased expression of transcripts from 21 genes identified in the literature as up regulated in tamoxifen resistance (STable 2). Conversely, MCF-7 cells co-cultured with CD146pos fibroblasts had increased expression of 15 genes identified in the literature as down-regulated in tamoxifen resistance (STable 3). From these lists we identified a set of 9 genes directly influenced by fibroblast co-cultures (5 up-regulated genes in MCF-7 cells co-cultured with CD146neg fibroblasts and 4 genes up-regulated in MCF-7 cells co-cultured with CD146pos fibroblasts) that produced a high confidence gene signature that reliably predicts recurrence-free survival in patients treated with tamoxifen (training set 181 patients p = 3\u00d710\u22125 and validation set 87 patients p = 0.00147) (Fig. 6C). Importantly, the 9-gene set was not predictive of recurrence-free survival in a set of 125 patients that were not treated with tamoxifen, suggesting it is linked to tamoxifen resistance and not a mere association with poor patient prognosis (SFig. 6C). Furthermore, a signature composed of all 36 genes is not predictive of recurrence free survival in the tamoxifen treated groups (SFig. 6D). Because CD146 correlates with Allred score, we asked if our gene set was predictive of recurrence-free survival simply due to the fact that ER expression correlates with better patient outcomes in patients treated with tamoxifen. Consistent with this idea, we split the same data cohorts, along the median, into high and low ER expression and assessed recurrence-free survival. If our CD146 based gene signature, and, by extension, the stromal composition, were only a surrogate for ER expression, then a significant survival advantage would be expected in patients with higher ER expression. However, high ER gene expression was not predictive of recurrence-free survival in tamoxifen treated or untreated patients (SFig. 6E\u2013G), and we conclude that the stromal composition significantly influences tamoxifen response in a novel way that does not resolve simply on ER expression. These data show that influence from CD146pos fibroblasts is predictive of improved recurrence free survival after tamoxifen treatment, whereas influence from CD146neg fibroblasts produces a tumor gene signature predictive of poorer prognosis in tamoxifen treated breast cancer patients.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates how functionally distinct subtypes of cancer associated fibroblasts can directly affect ER expression and growth dependency in luminal breast cancers. We identified two subtypes of CAFs that contribute to tumor ER heterogeneity influence tumor response to anti-endocrine therapy. Development of tamoxifen resistant cell lines, such as TAMR-1 cells, requires escalating doses and long-term agent exposure (up to one year); strikingly, in this study we show that a similar phenotype can be achieved by a short co-culture (five days) with CD146neg CAFs. Equally important, we can reverse the tamoxifen resistant phenotype by a short co-culture with CD146pos CAFs. These data strongly support the need to consider CAFs in order to further elucidate mechanisms of anti-endocrine resistance. As proof of principle, we were able to identify an epithelial gene signature enforced by CAF subtypes that accurately predicted recurrence-free survival in tamoxifen treated patients.Development of anti-endocrine resistance has been linked to activation of signaling pathways that converge on PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, including EGFR, HER2 and IGF1R. Although there is reasonable controversy regarding the role of IGF1R signaling in conditions of sustained anti-endocrine resistance, several studies demonstrate IGF1R as a modifying factor. Our data focuses on short-term cultures and demonstrates phosphorylation of EGFR and IGF1R as well as decreased proliferation in response to the HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab in ER+ BCCs influenced by CD146neg fibroblasts. Discoveries of RTK activation in tamoxifen resistance prompted several clinical trials utilizing single receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) in combination with anti-endocrine therapy as a way to delay endocrine resistance. Unfortunately, the variable outcome in many of these trials led to conclusions that targeting RTKs was largely ineffective for ER+ breast cancer.Our data demonstrates that fibroblast subtypes, present in the TME, can dictate which RTKs are active in ER+ BCCs. For example, both CD146pos and CD146neg fibroblasts promote EGFR phosphorylation in ER+ BCCs, but CD146neg fibroblasts also promote IGF1R phosphorylation and sensitize ER+ BCCs to the HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab. These data would suggest that a single EGFR RTKI combined with anti-endocrine therapy might work for tumors with a high percentage of CD146pos fibroblasts in the TME, but a use of a broad RTKI that can target EGFR, HER2 and/or IGF1R simultaneously may be a better choice for tumors expressing mostly CD146neg fibroblasts in the TME. In fact, recent efforts suggest that combining multiple RTKIs, or using a broad spectrum RTK inhibition approach with AKT/mTOR inhibitors in combination with anti-endocrine therapy is a more effective approach. Our data suggest that the examination of TME and fibroblast subtypes, may lead to improvements in personalization of care.Specifically in luminal breast cancers, ER serves as both a prognostic and predictive marker in patients and forms the basis of clinical decision-making. However, efficacy of treatment is limited by development of anti-endocrine resistance that leads to treatment failure and disease recurrence and progression. Although ER expression is correlated with better patient outcomes, it does not predict for which patients will have recurrent disease after tamoxifen treatment. Here, we have identified an epithelial gene signature based on stromal influence that is predictive of recurrent disease after tamoxifen treatment. This signature could be used to guide aggressive treatment from the time of diagnosis in patients with the CD146neg signature. Minimally, our data presents a new paradigm for considering CAFs as a heterogeneous population that has significant impact on endocrine response. However, whether the ratio of CD146pos/CD146neg cells is host dependent remains to be answered. Prior studies have shown recruitment of stromal components to tumors and it is therefore conceivable that some tumors are more apt at recruiting distant stroma into the microenvironment than others. Furthermore, it is unclear if recruited CAFs have a given CD146 phenotype/signature prior to arriving or if this is a programmable state.In summary, we have shown that CAFs do not represent a homogeneous cell population, but contain at least two distinct cellular subtypes that differentially influence breast cancer cells with respect to their molecular characteristics, phenotypic behavior in disease progression, and markers of therapeutic response. Our data support the hypothesis that tumors hijack normal stromal components of the tissue microenvironment and use it to their advantage. The generation of CAF cell lines and their study with a broader range of metastatic transplant models will also provide a model system to functionally define the breast cancer microenvironment. We believe that studies of CAF biology and improved targeting of their interactions with tumor cells will enhance our ability to deliver personalized therapy.Supplementary MaterialConflict of interest: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.ReferencesEstrogen receptor determination in fine needle aspirates of the breast.

(B) SRB total protein analysis of MCF-7 cells cultured in conditioned media from CD146pos (HS27a) fibroblasts have significantly increased proliferation in response to estrogen treatment and significantly decreased proliferation in response to treatment with 4-OH-tamoxifen. In contrast, conditioned media from CD146neg fibroblasts renders MCF-7 cells unresponsive to estrogen and 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment. Data are normalized against an estrogen withdrawn (EWD) untreated control collected at the time of treatment. (C) SRB total protein analysis of tamoxifen resistant TAMR-1 cells cultured in conditioned media from CD146pos (HS27a) fibroblasts have significantly decreased proliferation when treated with 4-OH-tamoxifen. Data are normalized against an estrogen withdrawn (EWD) untreated control collected at the time of treatment.

(A) Tumors established with CD146pos (HS27a) fibroblasts had significantly smaller tumors by 6 weeks after treatment with tamoxifen. In comparison, tumors established with CD146neg (HS5) fibroblasts did not respond to tamoxifen treatment.

In comparison, tumor established with CD156neg (HS5) fibroblasts did not respond to 4-OH-TAM.

(B) SRB total protein analysis of MCF-7 cells cultured in conditioned media with 2.5% reduced charcoal stripped serum from MCF-7 cells or either fibroblast subtype (HS27a and HS5) have significantly decreased proliferation in response to gefitinib treatment. (C) SRB total protein analysis of MCF-7 cells cultured in conditioned media with 2.5% reduced charcoal stripped serum from CD146neg (HS5) fibroblasts have significantly decreased proliferation in response to trastuzumab treatment. (D) Western blot analysis of MCF-7 cells demonstrates that only MCF-7 cells grown in CM from CD146pos (HS27) or CD146neg (HS5) fibroblasts express pEGFR protein. Receptor tyrosine kinase arrays demonstrate phosphorylated EGFR protein (pEGFR) in MCF-7 cells influenced by both fibroblast subtypes (HS27a and HS5). Phospho-IGF1R is present only in MCF-7 cells influenced by CD146neg fibroblasts (HS5).

(B) Hierarchical clustering of Affymetrix gene expression data for normal fibroblasts (HS27a and HS5) and our primary CAFs compared to Finak et. al. data demonstrates that CD146pos fibroblasts predict for better patient outcomes and CD146neg fibroblasts for poorer patient outcomes. Triplicate samples were used for gene expression array analysis. (C) Patient training and validation sets for a gene signature consisting of 5 genes (PRKCA, MACROD2, SMARCA4, BNIP3, MYO1B) predicted to be up and 4 genes (RPLP1, CDC42EP4, MAP2K4 and SIAH2) predicted to be down in the epithelial component of ER+ breast cancer was generated from RNAseq data in MCF-7/CAF co-cultures. The gene signature demonstrates significant predictive power of increased recurrence-free survival in patients with the CD146pos signature. *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001.TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCEEstrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer is the most common subtype. Targeting ER is an effective therapy, but development of anti-endocrine resistance remains a major cause of treatment failure. Attempts to uncover and therapeutically target mechanisms of anti-endocrine resistance have focused mainly on tumor intrinsic traits. Here we identify two subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), based on their CD146 expression. We further show that CAF subtypes differentially contribute to tumoral ER expression and tamoxifen sensitivity. CD146neg CAFs enforce ER independent growth and mediate tamoxifen resistance by activating receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. Furthermore, the CAF subtypes predict treatment response and patient outcomes. We believe that these findings have clear clinical implications and support a direct role for the tumor microenvironment in modulating response to anti-endocrine therapy. Insight into CAF-tumor interactions and recognition of CAF subtypes in breast cancer could lead to further improvements in personalized care."

Tumor epithelial cells coexist in carcinomas with different stromal cell types that together create the microenvironment of cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major components of tumor stroma, are active fibroblasts that, similarly to myofibroblasts, are highly heterogeneous, acquire contractile features, and express \u03b1-smooth-muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Active fibroblasts play similar roles in wound healing and in cancer, which may be considered as a wound that does not heal. CAFs represent 80% of the resident fibroblasts in breast tumors. CAFs release high levels of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases that may affect either other stroma cells or cancer cells. Accumulated evidence indicates that they play an important role in cancer initiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. Thus, CAFs represent an attractive target for cancer therapy.Exosomes are small (40\u2013100 nm) vesicles that have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication in cancer. They have been identified in most body fluids, including urine, amniotic fluid, serum, saliva, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and nasal secretions. Exosomes mediate local and systemic cell communication through the horizontal transfer of information, such as microRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins. Over the last decade, a number of studies has revealed that exosomes influence major tumor-related pathways, such as invasion, migration, epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, and therapy resistance.MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of non-coding 17\u201324 nucleotide-long RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. miRs are involved in many biological activities such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration, disease initiation, and progression. Their deregulation plays an essential role in the development and progression of cancer: miRs are up- or down-regulated in malignant tissues compared to the normal counterpart, and so can be either oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Recently, microRNAs have been identified in exosomes, which can be taken up by neighboring or distant cells and subsequently promote oncogenic signaling in recipient cells upon delivery of the cargo.Here, we analyze whether the release of CAF exosomes and their specific miR cargo could dictate an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer. Our results demonstrate that three miRs (miRs -21, -143, and -378e) are released from CAF exosomes. When loaded into breast cancer cells, they promote important tumorigenic features: stemness, EMT, and anchorage-independent cell growth. Thus, the release of CAF exosomes may be responsible for the delivery of miRs that promote oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells.RESULTSIdentification of oncogenic miRs in CAF exosomesBreast fibroblasts were isolated from human breast biopsies for primary culture. The isolated cultures were characterized by immunocytochemistry for CK22 (pan-keratin) and Western blot analysis for e-cadherin and \u03b1-SMA (Supplementary Figure 1a, b). Exosomes were isolated from breast fibroblast-conditioned media with ExoQuick-TC and characterized by Western blot analysis for the exosomal markers CD63, CD81, Hsp70, and Alix (Supplementary Figure 1c). To identify oncogenic miRs in CAF exosomes, we conducted genome-wide expression profiling of miRs (nCounter miRNA assay, nanoString Technologies, OSU), comparing exosomal miRs derived from two breast CAF cultures (patients #3 and #4) and two normal fibroblast (NF) cultures (patients #1 and #2). We found that three miRs were significantly up-regulated in CAF exosomes respect to NF exosomes: miR-21-5p, miR-378e, and miR-143-3p (Table 1). RT-PCR was conducted to confirm the array data. Interestingly, we found that miR-143-3p was up-regulated in CAF cells as compared to NFs, but we did not observe the same for miR-21-5p or miR-378e (Supplementary Figure 2a, b, c). Furthermore, we analyzed expression levels of miRs -21, -143 and -378e in CAFs from twelve different breast cancer molecular subtypes (five luminal A, six luminal B, one HER-2), but we did not observe a significant correlation between miRs\u2019 levels and molecular subtypes (Supplementary Figure 2d).miRNA expression profiles in NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes\tRatio of geom means: NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes\tUnique id\t \t1\t0,537960845\thsa-miR-21-5p\t \t2\t0,703937608\thsa-miR-378e\t \t3\t0,768350227\thsa-miR-143-3p\t \t4\t0,795360008\thsa-miR-1246\t \t5\t0,813311489\thsa-miR-1253\t \t6\t0,880781514\thsa-miR-155-5p\t \t7\t0,938786077\thsa-miR-549\t \t8\t1,032793771\thsa-miR-125b-5p\t \t9\t1,228928787\thsa-miR-1283\t \t10\t1,256584027\thsa-miR-25-3p\t \t11\t1,294286206\thsa-miR-302d-3p\t \tExosomes were isolated from four primary breast fibroblast cultures: two normal and two cancer-associated cultures. miRNA screening was performed by microarray, as described in Materials and Methods. Fold-change values were generated from the median expression of the miRNAs in the compared groups (NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes). Three miRs were found to be up-regulated in CAF exosomes as compared to NF exosomes.miRs -21, -143, and -378 expression in breast invasive carcinoma patientsWe analyzed miRNA expression in a large cohort of TCGA database breast cancer patients (744 Breast Invasive Carcinoma samples). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between miR-143 and -378 (p<0.0001) and between miR-143 and -21 (p<0.05) expression (Figure 1a). These findings suggest that the co-expression of these miRs may represent a pro-oncogenic signature of Breast Invasive Carcinoma. Furthermore, Log-Rank test analysis indicated that patients with lower levels of miR-378 had longer overall survival, suggestive of a prognostic role of miR-378 (p<0.01) (Figure 1b). In addition, miR-143 expression was significantly increased in high (III/IV) compared to low (I/II) breast cancer stages (p<0.05; Figure 1c).miRs -21, -143, and -378 are co-expressed, miR-378 correlates with prognosis, and miR-143 correlates with tumor stages in breast cancermiR expression was evaluated using 744 Breast Invasive Carcinoma patients from TCGA database. Statistically significant co-expression of miRs -143 and -378 levels, and of miRs -143 and -21 levels were identified in the analyzed cohort. Statistical significance calculated using Pearson's correlation analysis. P<0.05 was considered significant a. Kaplan-Meier survival curve: correlation between miR-378 and overall survival of 20 highly and 44 poorly miR-378-expressing breast cancer patients in TCGA database.

P-value calculated using Log-Rank test. P<0.05 was considered significant b. A significant increase in miR-143 expression was identified in high (III/IV) compared to low (I/II) breast cancer stages. Statistical significance calculated using Student's t-test. P<0.05 was considered significant c.Breast fibroblast-derived exosomes are transferred to T47D cellsTo examine whether fibroblast exosomes could be transferred to T47D breast cancer cells, we collected exosomes from NF- and CAF-conditioned media, and fluorescently labeled them with PKH26. T47D cells were treated with labeled exosomes for different times, and then were stained with DAPI and green ALEXA488-conjugated anti-tubulin antibody. Confocal microscopy confirmed the ability of T47D cells to take up NF- (patients #2 and #6) and CAF- (patient #3) derived exosomes (Supplementary Figure 3, Figure 2a). Notably, the uptake was greater after 24 hours (Figure 2a). To get further evidence of exosome uptake, we collected a z-stack of six images (Supplementary Figure 4). NF exosomes (patient #6, Supplementary Figure 4a) and CAF exosomes (patient #3, Supplementary Figure 4b) were clearly taken up by T47D cells after 24 hours, as demonstrated by co-localization of ALEXA488 and PKH26 signals. These results indicate that NF- and CAF-derived exosomes can be transferred to T47D cells, and may play a role in breast cancer biology.Breast fibroblast-derived exosomes are transferred to T47D cells and miRs -21, -143, and -378e are shuttled by CAF exosomes into breast cancer cellsT47D cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of either NF- (patient #6) or CAF- (patient #3) derived PKH26-labeled exosomes for 24 hours. Exosomes were taken up by T47D cells (confocal microscopy, \u00d760 original magnification). T47D cells were stained using DAPI (nuclei) and ALEXA488-conjugated anti-tubulin antibody. Scale bar: 10\u03bcm a. T47D cells were treated 24 hours in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patient #6) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7 and #8). Real Time PCR was performed to evaluate miRs -21, -143, and -378e levels. Data obtained from three independent experiments and presented as mean value \u00b1 SD. P-value calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc testing. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01 (over control). \u00a7 p<0.05; \u00a7\u00a7 p<0.01 (over NF ex) b. T47D cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of exosomes isolated from cy3-miR-CAF#11 (cy3-miRs -21, -143, -378e) for 24 hours. Cy3-labeled miRs were shuttled from CAF#11 exosomes into T47D cells (confocal microscopy, \u00d760 original magnification). T47D cells were stained using DAPI (nuclei) and ALEXA488-conjugated anti-CD63 antibody. Scale bar: 10\u03bcm c.miRs released by CAFs are shuttled into breast cancer cells via exosomesIn order to demonstrate that CAFs vehiculate miRs -21, -143, and -378e via exosomes to breast cancer cells, we treated T47D cells with isolated CAF- or NF-exosomes (CAF patients #3, #7 and #8, NF patient #6) for 24 hours and then assessed miR levels by RT-PCR. T47D cells treated with CAF exosomes exhibited increased levels of these miRs as compared to either non-treated T47D cells or T47D cells treated with NF exosomes (Figure 2b). In addition, to visualize the transport of extracellular miRs derived from CAFs into T47D cells, we transfected CAFs (patient #11) with cy3-labeled miRs (cy3-miRs -21-5p, -143-3p, -378e) and then collected exosomes from cell media. Then, we cultured T47D cells with these exosomes. Confocal microscopy detected the signals of cy3-miRs in the cytoplasm of T47D cells (Figure 2c). Notably, as shown in z-stack images (Supplementary Figure 5a, b, c), cy3-miRs co-localized with the signals of the exosomal marker CD63. Taken together, these results suggest that CAF-secreted exosomes mediate the shuttling of miRs -21, -143, and -378e into T47D cells.CAF exosomes promote stemness properties, EMT phenotype, and anchorage-independent cell growthTo investigate the role of CAF exosomes on stemness, we studied suspension cultures of T47D cells. Briefly, we seeded T47D cells in stem medium in non-adherent conditions in the absence or presence of NF exosomes (patients #5, #6, and #10) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7 and #9). After four days, we assessed the ability of cells to form mammospheres. We observed a significant increase in the number (Figure 3a) and diameter (Figure 3b) of spheres in T47D cells treated with CAF exosomes compared with either non-treated or NF exosome-treated T47D cells, indicating that CAF exosomes increase the ability to form mammospheres. We next investigated whether CAF exosomes had an impact on anchorage-independent cell growth with a soft agar assay. We found that the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes (patients #7, and #12) increased the number of colonies as compared to the treatment of T47D cells with NF exosomes (#5, #6, and #10) (Figure 3c, 3d). Furthermore, the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7, #9, #12 and #13), but not NF exosomes (patients #5, #6 and #10), increased the expression of stemness markers (oct3/4, nanog, sox2) and EMT markers (snail and zeb) at mRNA (Figure 3e) and protein levels (Figure 3f). In addition, the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes decreased protein expression levels of the epithelial marker, e-cadherin (Figure 3f). Similar results were obtained in additional breast cancer cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) (Figure 3g). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that CAF exosomes foster cancer progression by promoting stemness properties, EMT phenotype, and anchorage-independent cell growth in breast cancer cells.CAF exosomes promote stemness, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, and anchorage-independent cell growthT47D cells were cultured under non-adherent conditions in stem medium in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patients #5, #6, and #10) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7, and #9). After four days, the capacity of cells to form spheres was assessed a.

T47D cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patients #5, #6, and #10) or CAF exosomes (patients #7, and #12). After 24h, cells were harvested and cultured in soft agar c. Scale bar: 100\u03bcm d. T47D cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of either NF ex (patients #5, #6, and #10) or CAF ex (patients #3, #7, #9, #12 and #13) for 24h e. or 48h f. Real Time PCR was performed to analyze oct3/4, nanog, sox2, snail and zeb mRNA levels (e). Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate nanog, sox2, oct3/4, zeb, e-cadherin and snail protein levels (f). BT549 cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patient #6) or CAF exosomes (patient #7) for 48h. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate e-cadherin and oct3/4 protein levels. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patient #5) o CAF exosomes (patient #12) for 48h. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate oct3/4 protein level g. Western blot from representative experiments is shown. Actin or vinculin were used as loading controls. The experiments were repeated at least three times (f, g). In a, b, c, e, data were obtained from three independent experiments and are presented as mean value \u00b1 SD. P-value was calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc testing. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0,001 (over control); \u00a7 p<0.05; \u00a7\u00a7 p<0.01; \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 p<0,001 (over NF ex) (a, b, e).

MiR levels upon transfection were assessed with Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6a). There was a significant increase in the number (Figure 4a) and diameter (Figure 4b) of mammospheres in T47D cell cultures transfected with miRs -143, -378e, or -21/\u2212143/\u2212378e as compared to scrambled controls. On the contrary, T47D cells transfected with specific anti-miRs displayed a significant decrease in the number (Figure 4c) and diameter (Figure 4d) of mammospheres as compared to T47D cells transfected with anti-scrambled controls. The effects of anti-miR transfection on miR levels were verified by Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6b). Furthermore, we analyzed Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in T47D cells transfected with miRs -21, -143, and -378e for 48h. Interestingly, we observed an increased ALDH activity in T47D cells transfected with miRs as compared to T47D cells transfected with scrambled controls (Figure 4e). Additionally, we assessed the impact of the miRs on the expression of stem cell and EMT markers by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. T47D cells transfected with the miRs showed increased mRNA and protein levels of stemness and EMT markers, and decreased levels of e-cadherin protein, as compared to scrambled controls (Figure 4f, 4g). Similar results were obtained in additional breast cancer cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) (Figure 5a, 5b). MiR levels in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells upon transfection were assessed by Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6a). On the contrary, we found that T47D cells transfected with specific anti-miRs exhibited decreased levels of sox2 mRNA (Figure 5c) and of EMT markers (Figure 5d). We then analyzed the effect of the miRs on anchorage-independent cell growth with a soft agar assay. We observed an increased number of colonies in T47D cells transfected with miRs as compared to scrambled controls (Figure 6a, 6b). Finally, we performed invasion assay in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with miR-21, miR-143 and miR-378e. Breast cancer cells transfected with miRs exhibited higher invasive capacity than cells transfected with scrambled controls (Figure 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f). Taken together, these results clearly support the idea that miRs -21, -143, and -378e, similarly to CAF exosomes, promote anchorage-independent cell growth, stemness, and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells.miR-21, miR-143, and miR-378e promote stemness and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionT47D cells were transfected with scrambled (scr, control) or miRs -21, -143, and -378e, alone or in combination (final concentration: 100nM).

When we performed a mammosphere formation assay, we observed a significant increase in the number (Figure 7a) and diameter (Figure 7b, c) of T47D spheres in cells treated with NF exosomes transfected with miRs compared to cells treated with NF exosomes containing scrambled controls. Furthermore, treated T47D cells had increased levels of stemness (oct3/4, nanog, and sox2) and EMT (snail and zeb) markers as compared to control cells (Figure 7d, e). These data clearly show that NF exosomes enriched in miRs -21, -143, and -378e acquire the ability to promote stemness properties and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells.NF exosomes transfected with miRs -21, -143, -378e, similarly to CAF exosomes, promote stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotypeNF (patients #5, and #6) were cultured for 48h.

Accumulated evidence indicates that CAFs, the major components of tumor stroma, promote tumor processes such as angiogenesis, motility, metastasis, and therapy resistance in several solid tumors. Tumor stroma and tumor cells communicate not only through classical paracrine signaling mechanisms (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors), but also through exosomes. Exosomes are nano-vesicles that vehiculate lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs among cells, thereby modulating cell biology. It has been recently shown that they play an essential role in cancer development, prognosis, progression, and therapy resistance. In the context of cancer, this process entails the transfer of cancer-promoting cellular contents between cancer cells and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment or into the circulation to act at distant sites, thereby enabling cancer progression. It has been shown that melanoma-derived exosomes from the primary tumor \u201ceducated\u201d their environment to form a pro-tumorigenic niche and programmed bone marrow-derived progenitors at the pre-metastatic site to assume a proangiogenic phenotype, thereby enhancing metastatic dissemination. Furthermore, fibroblast-secreted exosomes promoted breast cancer cell migration through WNT-PCP signaling. More recently, it has been demonstrated that human CAFs secreted ADAM10-rich exosomes that promoted cell motility and activated RhoA and Notch signaling in several cancer cells.In order to develop therapeutic approaches, we analyzed the miR content of exosomes from breast CAFs. We describe here for the first time that CAFs promote breast cancer progression through exosome-mediated delivery of oncogenic miRs to breast cancer cells. microRNA sequencing identified increased miRs -21, -378e, and -143 levels in CAF exosomes. Immunofluorescence revealed transfer of PKH26-labeled exosomes and their miR content from fibroblasts to breast cancer cells.miR-21 is a well-characterized oncogenic miR. In particular, its presence in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis, regulates EMT phenotype, and promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Recently, exosomal miR-21 has been reported as an EMT promoter in oral carcinoma. The tumorigenic role of miR-143 depends on the cancer type, and recent findings suggest that it has a critical role in the tumor microenvironment of lung cancer, promoting tumor growth and neoangiogenesis. MiR-378e has not been studied for an oncogenic/oncosuppressive role.We analyzed miRNA expression in a large cohort of breast cancer patients present in the TCGA database. We found a statistically significant positive correlation between miRs-143 and -378 and between miRs-143 and -21 (p<0.05), strongly suggesting that co-expression of these miRs may represent a pro-oncogenic signature. Furthermore, Log-Rank test analysis indicated that patients with lower levels of miR-378 had longer overall survival, suggestive of a prognostic role of miR-378 (p<0.01). Finally, we found that miR-143 expression was significantly increased in high (III/IV) compared to low (I/II) breast cancer stages (p<0.05).Many tumors, including breast cancer, are maintained by a subpopulation of cells that display stem cell properties, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Analogous to the regulation of normal stem cells by their \u201cniche\u201d, CSCs are regulated by, and in turn regulate, cells within the tumor microenvironment. Several studies have provided evidence that these CSCs mediate tumor metastasis and contribute to treatment resistance and relapse. Recent findings have shown that the hierarchically organized cell populations are more plastic than previously imagined. Thus, epithelial cells may dedifferentiate and thereby enter back into the stem cell pool. Thus, therapies aimed at targeting the CSCs within a tumor will not be curative if the pool of CSCs can be continuously regenerated from plastic, non-cancer stem cells capable of dedifferentiating and reentering the CSC state. Notably, accumulating evidence indicates that the expression of oct3/4, nanog, and sox2 transcription factors is strongly correlated with CSCs: knockdown of these genes decreased sphere formation and inhibited tumor development in xenograft tumor models. The transdifferentiation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, a process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is integral in development, wound healing, and stem cell behavior, and contributes pathologically to fibrosis and cancer progression. This switch is mediated by key transcription factors, including snail and zeb, and is characterized by the loss of epithelial marker expressions, such as e-cadherin. In breast carcinomas, induction of EMT promotes the generation of CSCs that are able to form mammospheres, and, similarly, CSCs isolated from tumors express EMT markers. In this scenario, discovering the underlying mechanisms that promote dedifferentiation processes could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies.In the present study, we demonstrate that CAF exosomes and their miRs promote dedifferentiation of breast cancer cells. For the first time, we provide evidence that CAF exosomal miRs induce stemness and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells. Moreover, normal fibroblast exosomes transfected with these miRs promoted stemness and EMT, similarly to CAF exosomes. Interestingly, we found that breast cancer cells treated with CAF exosomes or transfected with miR-143 and miR-378e showed increased capacity to form mammospheres. Importantly, normal fibroblast exosomes, once transfected with miRs -378e, and -143, similarly to CAF exosomes, promoted the mammosphere formation. On the contrary, breast cancer cells co-transfected with combinations of specific anti-miRs displayed a strong reduction of these effects, thereby underlying a good strategy to prevent dedifferentiation of breast cancer cells. Finally, we found that CAF exosomes and their miRs increased anchorage-independent cell growth in breast cancer cells. Our data show that the identified miRs does not act in a synergic way, but together they may favor an aggressive phenotype: miR-21 seems to be the best inducer of anchorage-independent cell growth and increases stemness and EMT markers, while miR-143 and miR-378e are the strongest promoters of stemness. In summary, we conclude that CAFs regulate the development of an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer cells through exosome-mediated delivery of oncogenic miRs.MATERIALS AND METHODSPrimary and continuous cells and mammosphere culturesBreast cancer cell lines, T47D, BT549, MDA-MB-231 from ATCC, were grown in RPMI-1640 medium. Primary cultures of fibroblasts, deriving from patients treated at the Clinica Mediterranea (Naples, Italy), were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12). Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).For mammosphere cultures, single-cell suspensions were plated at a density of 1,000 cells/ml in Corning ultra-low attachment multi-well plates. Cells were grown in stem medium: serum-free DMEM-F12 (Sigma, Milan, Italy) supplemented with B27 (Life technologies, Milan, Italy), 20ng/ml EGF (Sigma, Milan, Italy), 10ng/ml bFGF (BD Biosciences, Milan, Italy), and 1X antibiotic-antimycotics (Life technologies, Milan, Italy). After 4-7 days, mammospheres appeared as spheres of floating viable cells.Isolation of primary cell cultures from human breast biopsiesHuman breast biopsies (samples from the Clinica Mediterranea) were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile scissors and tongs. Extracellular matrix was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight under continuous agitation at 37\u00b0C. The drawn cellular suspensions were separated on the basis of their weights by two different centrifugations: the first one at 500 rpm for 5 minutes to obtain epithelial cell pellets, the second one at 1200 rpm 5 minutes to obtain fibroblast pellets.ImmunocytochemistryThe separation between epithelial cells and fibroblasts from human breast biopsies was confirmed by the cell block technique (Shandon cytoblock kit) followed by immunocytochemistry. A primary antibody was used for CK22 (pan-keratin), a known epithelial marker, in order to discriminate epithelial cells from fibroblasts.Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of primary fibroblasts that were grown in DMEM-F12 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (FBS depleted of exosomes, SBI, System Biosciences) and 1X antibiotic-antimycotics (Life technologies, Milan, Italy). Culture media were centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C or room temperature to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred to sterile tubes in an appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC\u2122 Exosome Isolation Reagent (SBI, System Biosciences), considering 2 ml of ExoQuick-TC\u2122 solution for every 10 ml of cell culture medium. Then, the tubes were subjected to mild agitation until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. Finally, the tubes were kept at 4\u00b0C O/N (12 hours at least were necessary). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged firstly at 1500 g for 30 minutes, and then at 1500 g for 5 minutes (at 4\u00b0C or RT). At the end of the steps, white/beige exosomal pellets appeared.RNA extraction and real time PCRTotal RNA (microRNAs and mRNAs) was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed starting from equal amounts of total RNA/sample (150/500ng) using miScript reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) for miR analysis, and using SuperScript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) for mRNA analysis. Quantitative analysis of miR-21, miR-143, miR-378e and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by Real Time PCR using specific primers (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy). Real Time PCR was also used to assess the mRNAs of nanog, oct3/4, sox2, snail, zeb, and \u03b2-actin (as an internal reference), using iQ\u2122 SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).

The reaction for detection of miRs was performed in this manner: 95\u00b0C for 15\u2032, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15\u2032\u2019, 55\u00b0C for 30\u2032\u2019 and 70\u00b0C for 30\u2032\u2019. All reactions were run in triplicate. The threshold cycle (CT) is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold. For relative quantization, the 2(\u2212\u0394\u0394CT) method was used. Experiments were carried out in triplicate for each data point, and data analysis was performed by using Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR Systems.NCounter miRNA assayExosomes were isolated from four different samples of primary fibroblasts: two normal and two cancer-associated fibroblasts. Then, exosomal RNA was extracted in order to perform an \u201cnCounter miRNA assay\u201d (nanoString Technologies, OSU, Columbus, OHIO). Eight-hundred human miRs were digitally detected and counted in a single reaction without amplification. System performance consisted of 6 positive miRNA assay controls, 6 negative miRNA assay controls, and 5 mRNA housekeeping controls. 100ng of purified total RNA was used as starting material. miR expression levels were measured calculating the ratio of geom. means (NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes).TCGA data analysisThe collection of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) platform was compliant with laws and regulations for the protection of human subjects, and necessary ethical approvals were obtained. Analysis of all data was done using GraphPad Prism 6 (San Diego, CA, USA). For our analysis, we downloaded BCGSC IlluminaHiSeq_miRNASeq (level 3) along with clinical information from the TCGA database in July 2015.Cell and exosome transfectionFor transient over-expression/downregulation of miRs, cells at 50% confluence were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and 100nM of pre-miR-21, pre-miR-143-3p, pre-miR-378e, or scrambled pre-miR; or 200nM of anti-miR-21, anti-miR-143-3p, anti-miR-378e, or scrambled anti-miR (Ambion\u00ae, Life Technologies). For miR over-expression, exosomes isolated with ExoQuick-TC\u2122 solution were transfected using Exo-Fect\u2122 Exosome Transfection Reagent (SBI, System Biosciences) and 130nM of pre-miR-21, pre-miR-143-3p, pre-miR-378e, or scrambled pre-miR.Transfection of CAFs with Cy3-labeled-miRsCAFs were transfected with 10nM of Cy3-labeled miRs (miR-21-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-378e, Tebu-bio, San Diego, CA, USA) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Six hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, and the culture media switched to fresh DMEM-F12 1% A/A, 10% exo-FBS. After incubation for a day, the culture media were collected and used for exosome preparation.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in JS buffer (50mM HEPES ph 7.5 containing 150mM NaCl, 1% Glycerol, 1% Triton X100, 1.5mM MgCl2, 5mM EGTA, 1mM Na3VO4, and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail). Exosomes were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%, 12% or 15% acrylamide). Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy). For immunoblot experiments, membranes were blocked for 1 hour with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) containing 0,1% Tween-20, and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies. Detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). Primary antibodies used were: anti-\u03b2-actin and anti-\u03b1-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy), anti-vinculin, anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-e-cadherin, anti-zeb, anti-oct3/4, anti-nanog, anti-sox2, anti-slug, anti-snail, anti-CD63, anti-hsp70, anti-alix, anti-CD81 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). ImageJ software was used to provide WB quantification.Immunofluorescence analysis1) Uptake of fibroblast exosomes by T47D cells. Once isolated, exosomes were labeled with PKH26, a red fluorescent cell membrane linker (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, exosomes were stained 5 minutes at RT with PKH26 (diluted 1:1000 in PBS), then 1ml of BSA 1% was added to the tubes and mixed. Finally, the tubes were centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 minutes and pellets were put in 500\u03bcl of PBS. For immunofluorescence, cells grown on glass coverslips were treated at different incubation times with PKH26-exosomes, washed six times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS. Then, cells were permeabilized with PBS 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes at room temperature, and blocked in PBS 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 minutes. Cells were incubated with anti-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz), diluted in PBS 1% BSA, for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Coverslips were washed 3 times with PBS and treated with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Coverslips were washed and mounted with Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. 2) Shuttling assays for fluorescently-labeled miRNAs. After a day from the transfection of CAFs with Cy3-labeled-miRs, exosomes were isolated from cell media, and T47D cells grown on glass coverslips were treated for 24 hours with the isolated exosomes. For immunofluorescence, it was used the same protocol as above, but cells were incubated with anti-CD63 primary antibody (Santa Cruz), then with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen).Mammosphere formation assayT47D cells were suspended 1000 cells/well in 1 ml of stem medium and plated into ultra-low attachment 48-well plates in presence of normal fibroblast or CAF exosomes. Alternatively, T47D cells were transfected with miRs or anti-miRs for 48 hours or 24 hours, respectively. Then, 1000 cells/well were suspended in 1 ml of stem medium and plated into ultra-low attachment 48-well plates. After 4-7 days, the formed mammospheres were counted, and the diameters were measured.ALDEFLUOR assayThe ALDEFLUOR assay was carried out according to manufacturer's (Stemcell Technologies) guidelines. Briefly, dissociated single cells were suspended in Aldefluor assay buffer containing an ALDH substrate, bodipy-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA) (5\u03bcl per milliliter of sample), and incubated for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. A fraction of cells was incubated under identical conditions in the presence of ALDH inhibitor (10\u03bcl per milliliter of sample), diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). Cells were analyzed using a BD Accuri\u2122 C6 (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and analyzed using the BD Accuri\u2122 C6 software.Soft-agar assay104 cells were plated in 60mm dishes in a solution containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 2\u00d7 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), TPB Buffer (Difco, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and 1.25% of Noble Agar (Difco, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Briefly, cells were harvested and counted, then a layer of 7ml with the solution containing Noble Agar were left to polymerize on the bottom of the dishes. Finally, cells were resuspended in 2ml of same solution and plated. Cells were left grown for 3 weeks in the incubator.Invasion assayIn vitro invasion assay was performed in 24-well Corning Multiwells 6.5mm Transwell\u00ae with 8.0\u03bcm Pore Polycarbonate Membrane Inserts. The lower chamber was filled with 600\u03bcl of RPMI medium supplemented with 10%FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotics. The top of the upper wells was coated with 25\u03bcl of Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD) diluted 1:6 in RPMI free medium and allowed to dry out at 37\u00b0C at least 4h. Then, 50.000 cells, previously transfected with miRs for 48h, were plated in RPMI free medium in the upper chamber. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20h. Then, cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed mechanically by wiping with a cotton swab, and the cells remaining on the lower side of the membrane were fixed and stained with Crystal Violet solution. Percentage of invasive cells was evaluated by eluting Crystal Violet solution with 1% SDS and reading the absorbance at \u03bb570nm.Statistical analysisAll experiments were repeated at least three times. Continuous variables are given as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. For comparisons between two groups, the Student's t test was used to determine differences between mean values for normally distributed. Comparisons among more than three groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc testing.

The resulting transformed microenvironment, also-called reactive stroma, differs from the stroma of the healthy mammary gland, showing disruptions in the fibroblast-epithelial cell cross-talk in terms of cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodelling. In particular, the migratory/invasive behaviour of tumor cells seems to be strongly influenced by this aberrant dialogue with the adjacent fibroblasts. The release of soluble factors by both kinds of cell types reciprocally influences their peculiar properties, creating suitable conditions for malignant cells not only to multiply but also to migrate and invade other tissues, outside the boundaries of the mammary gland. Fibroblasts arising from tumor stroma, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs), have acquired distinct properties mainly leading to the promotion of cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Differences in the activity of NFs versus CAFs in breast tumors may result from alterations in molecular and/or cellular mechanisms that are responsible for the production and release by CAFs of a number of soluble factors such as fibroblast growth factors, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), insulin-like growth factors, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Tumorigenicity of CAFs, derived from breast tumors and injected together with malignant cells, has been widely demonstrated in animal models. Induction of mammary cancers has also been demonstrated in mice orthotopically grafted with TGF-\u03b2-and/or HGF-transfected fibroblasts co-injected with apparently normal epithelial breast cells, highlighting the critical role of heterotypic interactions in human breast development. This tumor-stroma cross-talk seems to have an important influence also in the involved lymph-node microenvironments, as demonstrated by the ability of nodal fibroblasts to affect viability, proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. At the root of the alterations in these latter activities seems to be the induction of reciprocal changes in the genomic profiles of cancer and stromal cells involving, in particular, genes critical for growth control, cell adhesion and invasiveness.Despite the growing number of studies focused on epithelial-stromal interactions in solid tumors, the role played by fibroblasts in the development and progression of breast cancer is not yet fully understood. Thus, the use of relevant co-culture models using fibroblasts derived from normal and malignant stroma may provide a practical tool for the analysis of reciprocal influences between the stroma and the epithelial tumor compartment.In the present report, we sought to gain a deeper insight into some molecular and functional properties strongly correlated with cancer progression and metastatization. These properties may be supposed to be reciprocally influenced in the epithelium-stroma cross-talk occurring in breast cancer. With this aim, we performed breast cancer cells/fibroblasts co-culture assays and analyzed changes occurring in adhesion molecule expression, membrane fluidity, and migration velocity and directness in both the cell types. In our experimental approach, we co-cultured estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, poorly invasive and low metastasizing mammary cancer cells (MCF-7) or ER-negative, highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with fibroblasts isolated from mammary healthy skin (NFs) or from breast tumor stroma (CAFs) in conventional 2D adherent cultures or in a 3D system (nodules). Results obtained were compared with those from the respective homotypic cultures.Materials and MethodsBreast cancer cell linesThe estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, poorly invasive, and low metastasizing human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and the ER-negative, highly invasive, and metastatic human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Euroclone, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland), antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, Euroclone) and 2 mM glutamine (Euroclone). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.Clinical specimens and fibroblast culturesBreast cancer tissues and their relative normal counterparts (normal mammary skin samples) were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the Unit\u00e0 Operativa di Chirurgia Senologica, Facolt\u00e0 di Medicina e Chirurgia \u201cA. Gemelli\u201d, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Rome, Italy), according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Donors gave written informed consent to participate in the study.Breast cancer and normal mammary skin tissue samples were minced into small pieces (2\u20133 mm3) and attached onto 100 mm culture dishes. Primary normal mammary skin (NFs) and cancer-associated (CAFs) fibroblasts isolated from clinical specimens were maintained in DMEM (Euroclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, Euroclone), 2 mM glutamine (Euroclone) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Euroclone). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.The fibroblastic nature of the isolated cells was verified by microscopic determination of morphology portrait and immunocytochemical characterization using fibroblast- (anti-vimentin, V9 clone, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); epithelial tumor cell- (anti-cytokeratin 18, DC 10 clone, Dako), activated fibroblast- (anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, \u03b1-SMA, 1A4 clone, Dako), and endothelial cell- (anti-CD31, 89C2 clone, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) specific markers. NFs used for co-culture assays were immunoreactive for vimentin but negative for all the other markers. CAFs used for co-culture assays were immunoreactive for vimentin and \u03b1-SMA but negative for cytokeratin 18 and CD31. Co-culture experiments were carried out with fibroblasts (NFs and CAFs) of passage 2\u20133 to accumulate large amounts of cells for co-cultivation while avoiding cell aging effects.3D cultures/co-culturesFor the immnunohistochemical/immunoflurescence analysis, primary fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs) were directly co-cultured with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a 3D model (nodules) as previously described. Briefly, after detachment of cell monolayers with trypsin/EDTA, the cell density was arranged to 2.5\u00d7105 cells/ml for each cell type. One ml of the cell suspension was distributed in 5-ml centrifugation tubes containing semi-solid medium (final concentration: 1\u00d7DMEM-0.5% agar-agar). Cells were spinned down onto the semi-solid medium by centrifugation at 800 g for 10 min at 12\u00b0C. Most of the supernatant liquid medium was removed and the tubes incubated overnight in an incubator at 37\u00b0C. The next day, the pellets were recovered with 200 \u00b5l of 1\u00d7DMEM by gentle aspiration and transferred on 1006-Falcon Petri dishes containing 2 ml of semi-solid medium. Medium was renewed 2 days later and then after 5 days.For co-cultures, a 1\u22361 proportion of each cell type was used. Homotypic cultures of only one cell type were used as controls.After 4 or 6 days of culture, nodules were harvested for immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence analysis.2D cultures/co-culturesFor the evaluation of vimentin expression, cell membrane fluidity and migration, conventional 2D adherent cultures were used. Briefly, confluent fibroblast and breast cancer cell cultures were trypsinized and 0.5\u00d7105 cells of each cell type were plated together in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes (ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) for confocal microscopy analysis in their standard medium, which was renewed after 3 days. After for 6 days, membrane fluidity or cell migration were evaluated as described below. Homotypic cultures of only one cell type (1\u00d7105 cells) were used as controls.ImmunohistochemistryTo verify the distribution of the two cell types in 3D co-cultures, and the effects of the heterotypic interactions on fibroblast activation and cell growth, immunohistochemical analysis of pankeratin, \u03b1-SMA and proliferation markers (Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, PCNA) was performed on cryostat 10-\u00b5m-thick sections from 4- and 6-day frozen nodules. Nodules were previously fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were collected on superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific, Fremont, CA, USA), dried for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and blocked with Superblock (UCS Diagnostic, Rome, Italy) for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwave heating (500 W) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer of pH 6.0 for 5 min. The sections were incubated with anti-cytokeratin (large spectrum, pankeratin, KL1 clone; UCS Diagnostic; 1\u2236100 dilution), anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4 clone, Dako; 1\u223660 dilution), anti-Ki67 (MIB-1 clone, Dako; 1\u2236100 dilution) and anti-PCNA (PC10 clone, Dako; 1\u2236150 dilution) 1 h at RT in PBS. Then, a secondary antibody conjugate (HRP polymer conjugate, broad spectrum, Invitrogen) was applied for 30 min at RT. The chromogenic reaction was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution (Zymed Labs., South S. Francisco, CA, USA). The nuclei were lightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed. For proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA), three sections from three different nodules for each culture condition were examined by two independent observers. The number of positive cells (on a total of at least 800 cells) was assessed in four randomized high-power fields (\u00d7400) for each section. All the labelled tumor nuclei, regardless of the staining intensity, were considered positive. A mean percentage for every sample was obtained and data were reported as mean\u00b1SD.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy AnalysisTo assess the effect of tumor cell/fibroblast interaction on cell adhesion, immunofluorescence analysis of E- and N-cadherin was performed on cryostat 10 \u00b5m-thick frozen sections obtained as above described from 6-day nodule homotypic and heterotypic cultures. Sections were collected on superfrost slides (Thermo Scientific), dried for 15 min at RT and blocked with Superblock (UCS Diagnostic) for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by microwave heating (500 W) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min. Mouse monoclonal primary antibodies anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7 clone, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; 1\u2236200 dilution) and anti-N-cadherin (GC-4 clone, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 1\u22361000 dilution) were applied for 1 h at RT in PBS. Sections were then incubated with the secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG, 1\u2236200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at RT in PBS. Slides were mounted using 4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) containing mounting medium (Vector Labs., Burlingame, CA, USA). Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed for all reactions. Images were collected by using an inverted confocal microscope (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). They were obtained using a \u00d740 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) equipped with a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser (Chamaleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) for DAPI excitation at 750 nm and with an Ar/ArKr laser for Cy3 excitation at 543 nm. Internal photon multiplier tubes collected eight bit unsigned images at a 400 Hz scan speed. Image background values (defined as intensities below 7% of the maximum intensity) were set to zero and colored black. Imaging was performed at RT.Fluorescence Intensity values for each sample were quantified over multiple intensity images and ROIs and their mean\u00b1SD (n\u200a=\u200a15 to 20) determined and utilized for further statistical analysis (two-tailed Student's t-test).Western blot analysisCells of 6-day monolayer cultures were collected to be analyzed for verify the co-culturing effect on vimentin expression. Cells in mixed cultures were separated by magnetic cell sorting, using the EasySep\u2122 Magnet (STEMCELL Technologies, Voden Medical Instruments SpA, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS] freshly supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (100 \u00b5M Na3VO4, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 50 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin and 20 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin) on ice and the lysates clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Samples containing 30 \u00b5g of total protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) which was incubated (1 h, at RT) with anti-vimentin antibody (clone V9, Dako, 1\u22361000 dilution) in Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk (blocking buffer). The blot was then overlaid with a HRP-labelled secondary antibody (Vector Labs.; 1\u22362000 dilution) for 40 min in blocking buffer at RT. The protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and visualised on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham). Membranes were reprobed with an anti \u03b2-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC15, Sigma-Aldrich; 1\u223610,000 dilution) as an internal control for protein loading. The signals were quantified by densitometry (Chemi Doc Documentation System/Quantity One quantitation software, Bio-Rad).Laurdan two photon microscopyTo investigate the impact of tumour cell/fibroblast interactions on the respective membrane lipid packing density, homotypic or heterotypic cultures, maintained for 6 days in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes, were labelled with 2-dimethylamino(6-lauroyl)naphthalene (Laurdan, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA), a ratiometric fluorescent dye highly sensitive to the presence and mobility of water molecules within the membrane bilayer, yielding information on membrane order and fluidity by a shift in its emission spectrum. The probe was successfully applied to study membrane fluidity changes in living cells. Ratiometric probes allow the use of a ratio between two fluorescence intensities. This makes possible the correction of artifacts due to bleaching, changes in focus and variations in laser intensity. The Laurdan stock solution concentration was 2 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich), and it was renewed every three weeks. Laurdan labelling was performed directly in the culture media by adding the probe to the cells in culture at a final concentration of 2 \u00b5M. After 30\u201345 min of incubation in the dark at RT, cells were washed once with the complete culture medium and dishes mounted on an inverted confocal microscope (DMIRE2, Leica Microsystems) slide. Laurdan intensity images were obtained using a \u00d740 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4) under excitation at 800 nm with a mode-locked Titanium-Sapphire laser (Chamaleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Internal photon multiplier tubes collected eight bit unsigned images at a 400 Hz scan speed. Laurdan intensity images were recorded simultaneously with emission in the range of 400\u2013460 nm and 470\u2013530 nm and imaging was performed at RT.Image analysisMembrane fluidity can be measured in terms of ratio of emission intensities by using Generalized Polarization (GP) value, defined asGP value was calculated for each pixel using the two Laurdan intensity images (I(400\u2013460) and I(470\u2013530)) using the software Ratiometric image processor 2.0. The calibration factor G was obtained from the GP values of solutions of Laurdan in DMSO. G factor had \u223c2% variation across the imaging area. GP images (as eight-bit unsigned images) were pseudocoloured in Image-J. Background values (defined as intensities below 7% of the maximum intensity) were set to zero and coloured black. GP histograms values were determined within multiple Regions of Interest (plasma membranes of single cells) for each sample, and their mean\u00b1SD (n\u200a=\u200a15 to 20) determined and utilized for further statistical analysis (two-tailed Student's t-test). Line profiles and analysis of acquired images were performed with image J.Migration assayTo evaluate the reciprocal influences of tumour cells and fibroblasts on the respective migratory ability, confocal microscopy was performed in a temperature controlled room (T\u200a=\u200a30\u00b0C) on cells (homotypic and heterotypic cultures) cultured for 6 days in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes. In each experiment, the single cell type of interest (tumor cells or fibroblasts) has been labelled with the fluorescent probe CellTracker Green CMFDA (Invitrogen) that is retained in living cells through several generations and is not transferred to adjacent cells. Thus, the single cell movement was analyzed over a time period of 45 min. The time interval between consecutive frames was one min. Background noise was subtracted from each image. Cell tracking was performed by using the ImageJ software plugin \u201cParticleTracker\u201d. On average 40 cells per experiment were tracked. Once the analysis region was defined by means of the feature point detection and tracking algorithm, each cell was numbered and its (x(ti), y(ti)) position coordinates measured for each time point ti (i\u200a=\u200a1,\u2026.,N\u200a=\u200a45). We used the ImageJ-plugin \u201cChemotaxis and migration tool\u201d to analyze kinematic quantities of migration processes: the migration velocity, the Euclidean and accumulated distances and the directness. The instantaneous migration velocity for each cell was calculated as  where vix and viy were calculated according to the expression:Where (x(ti+1), y(ti+1), (x(ti), y(ti))) are the positions of each cell at the time ti+1 and ti. The mean migration velocity  was calculated according to the expression:The Euclidian distance dE for each cell was calculated as the length of the straight line between the cell start point (x(t1), y(t1)) and the end point(x(tN), y(tN)):The accumulated distance dA for each cell is the result of the sum of all incremental movements measured in between consecutive images:The directness, which represents a measure of the cell's tendency to travel in a straight line, is calculated as the ratio of the Euclidian distance and the accumulated distance.A directness of D\u200a=\u200a1 indicates a straight-line migration from the start point to the end point.Statistical analysisAt least three independent experiments were performed for each protocol. The two-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare means of two different groups; ANOVA and the Tukey's multiple comparison test were used to study differences of means of multiple samples. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.ResultsCharacterization of isolated fibroblastsImmunocytochemically characterized populations of the isolated mammary fibroblasts (normal dermal and cancer-associated) stained uniformly for vimentin, but resulted negative for cytokeratin 18 and CD31, confirming the stromal origin of cells and the absence of contaminating epithelial or endothelial elements. As reported in literature, approximately 10\u201312% of the CAFs were positive for \u03b1-SMA, while among the NF population only very few elements showed \u03b1-SMA immunoreactivity, probably induced by the culture condition (i.e. 2D cultures) (data not shown). Morphologically, NFs in culture showed the typical spindle-shape fibroblast-like appearance (Figure 1A), while CAFs exhibited a more irregular and flattened morphology (Figure 1B).Morphology of isolated normal and tumor-derived fibroblasts.Light microscopic view showing the different morphology of fibroblasts isolated from human healthy mammary skin (A) or human breast cancer (B) samples after 6 days of culture. Original magnification, \u00d7200.Spatial distribution of tumor/fibroblast cells in 3D co-culturesRepresentative cytokeratin-stained sections from tumor/fibroblast nodule co-cultures (MCF-7/NFs, MCF-7/CAFs, MDA-MB-231/NFs, MDA-MB-231/CAFs) at day 6 are shown in Figure 2, indicating the spatial distribution of tumor cells (stained with the epithelial marker cytokeratin) and fibroblasts in this culture model. As expected, in MCF-7/fibroblast cell nodules fibroblasts were concentrated in the central zone leaving a strip of almost pure cancer cells at the periphery of the nodules. In the MDA-MB-231/fibroblast cell co-cultures, a more diffuse distribution of the two cell types was observed. In contrast to the less invasive MCF-7 cells, the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells extensively infiltrated the fibroblast core, particularly in the presence of CAFs.Spatial distribution of breast tumor cells and fibroblasts in nodule co-cultures.Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule co-cultures of either MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells with fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-cytokeratin (large spectrum, pankeratin) monoclonal antibody to identify the reciprocal location of the two cell types (tumor cells and fibroblasts) in the nodule co-cultures. The more invasive and less differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a looser association as compared to MCF-7/fibroblast co-cultures, with various cells infiltrating the fibroblast nodule core (arrows). DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification for upper panels (MCF-7/NFs, MCF-7/CAFs) and lower insets, \u00d7100; original magnification for lower panels (MDA-MB-231/NFs and MDA-MB-231/CAFs), \u00d7200.Similar cell distributions were observed at day 4 (data not shown).Highly invasive and metastatic breast tumor cells induced fibroblast activationThe immunocytochemical analysis for \u03b1-SMA, demonstrated that the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells, when co-cultured with CAFs for 6 days, induced a sharp increase in the amount of \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal elements, indicating the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype, typical of the breast tumor stroma (Figure 3). The poorly invasive and low metastasizing MCF-7 breast cancer cells were not able to influence \u03b1-SMA expression of tumor-associated fibroblast population (Figure 3). Neither the highly nor the poorly invasive tumor cells were able to induce activation of normal fibroblasts (data not shown). The same results were obtained after 4 days of co-culturing (data not shown).Breast tumor cell induction of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in tumor stroma-derived fibroblasts.Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule culture (CAFs) and co-cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells with CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-\u03b1-SMA monoclonal antibody to verify the effect of breast cancer cells on fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. \u03b1-SMA expression was induced in the tumor-associated fibroblast population as a result of the interaction with the more aggressive and less differentiated MDA-MB-231 cells, demonstrating the ability of these cells to promote stroma activation. DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification, \u00d7200.Cancer-associated fibroblasts exerted a mitogenic effect on breast tumor cellsTo investigate the reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts on their respective cell growth, immunohistochemical analysis of proliferation markers (Ki67 and PCNA) was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule sections. As shown in Figure 4A, Ki-67 mainly displayed a uniform nuclear staining. A weak cytoplasmic labelling was rarely observed but it did not interfere with the identification of positive nuclei. As expected, the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells was significantly higher in breast tumor cells co-cultured for 6 days with CAFs compared with control MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cell homotypic cultures. In fact, the MCF-7 cell/CAF mixed nodules showed a significantly larger proportion (50%; p<0.001) of Ki67-positive tumor cells compared to MCF-7 cells cultured alone (34.8%) or in the presence of NFs (30.6%) (Figure 4A and 4B). The same CAF-triggered mitogenic effects were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells as the percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells was higher (85%, p<0.001) compared to that of either MDA-MB-231 cell cultures or MDA-MB-231 cell/NF mixed nodules (61.7% and 60.3%, respectively) (Figure 4A and 4B). Mammary cancer cells seemed to have no influence on the growth of both kinds of fibroblasts. Similar results were obtained on 4-day co-cultures and with PCNA, even though a more heterogeneous and less intense nuclear staining was observed (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts but not their normal counterpart exerted mitogenic effect on breast cancer cells.(A) Sections (10 \u00b5m) of paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen nodule cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells) and co-cultures (MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells with NFs or CAFs) at day 6 of culture are shown. Sections were stained immunohistochemically using an anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibody (MIB-1 clone) to verify the reciprocal effect of the two cell types on their respective growth rate. The MCF-7 cell/CAF mixed nodules showed a higher number of Ki67-positive tumor cells with respect to that observed in MCF-7 cell/NF or MCF-7 cell nodules. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells and fibroblasts showed the same behavior as observed for MCF-7 cell/fibroblast nodule co-cultures.. DAB for detection; hematoxylin counterstaining; original magnification, \u00d7200. (B) Quantitative representation of the immunohistochemical data. Three sections, obtained from 3 different nodules, were analyzed by two independent observers. The number of Ki67-positive cells (on a total of at least 800 cells) was assessed in four randomized high-power fields (\u00d7400) for each section. A mean percentage for every sample was obtained and data were reported as mean\u00b1SD (error bars). Statistical significance was determined using ANOVA and the Tukey's multiple comparison test, *p<0.001.Cancer-associated and normal fibroblasts influenced E- and N-cadherin expression in breast tumor cellsTo test the reciprocal effects of cancer cells and fibroblasts on the respective adhesiveness, a confocal immunofluorescence study of E- and N-cadherin expression was performed on nodule sections. The basal level of E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells is shown (Figure 5A) and quantified (Figure 5E). The analysis demonstrated the ability of NFs to induce E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells after 6 days of co-culture, when a great increase in signal intensity (\u223c2.5-fold, compared with MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures, Figure 5B, 5C and 5E) was observed. On the other hand, a CAF-triggered down-regulation of the adhesion molecule (\u223c80%, compared with MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures) was seen (Figure 5D and 5E). An increase in N-cadherin level was observed in CAFs, as the result of a 6-day long interaction with both kinds of epithelial cancer cells (up to \u223c180%, compared with CAF homotypic cultures). CAFs, in turn, promoted the up-regulation of N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells (\u223c60%, compared with MDA-MB-231 cell homotypic cultures). CAF-induced N-cadherin expression was found in the N-cadherin-negative MCF-7 cells. NFs were not able to influence N-cadherin expression in cancer cells, neither were they affected by tumor cells (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts and their normal counterpart affected E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells.Frozen nodule sections from MCF-7 cell homotypic cultures (A) or MCF-7 cell/fibroblast mixed cultures (B and D) were processed for E-cadherin immunostaining (Cy3: red). DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining (blue) (C). Confocal images show the up-regulation of E-cadherin in MCF-7 cell population co-cultured with NFs (B) as compared to the MCF-7 homotypic culture (A). On the contrary, interaction with CAFs promoted a strong reduction in E-cadherin expression (D). A representative experiment of three is shown. (E) F (a.u.), fluorescence intensity (in arbitrary units). Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05.For all the cell types similar results were obtained with 4-day co-cultures (data not shown).Cancer-associated fibroblasts induced vimentin expression in breast tumor cellsAs shown in Figure 6, the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin was clearly induced in the relatively well-differentiated breast cancer cells (MCF-7) co-cultured with CAFs. An up-regulation of the protein was observed in the poorly differentiated, mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells. NFs did not affect the expression of the marker in cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT in breast tumor cells.Western blot analysis revealed that the vimentin protein expression was clearly induced in the low-invasive MCF7 cell line co-cultured with CAFs. Vimentin levels were increased in the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs as compared with the control (MDA-MB-231 cells cultured alone). No effect on vimentin expression was found in breast tumor cells co-cultured with NFs.Breast tumor cells and fibroblasts reciprocally influenced cell membrane fluidityThe impact of fibroblast/tumour cell interplay on the respective plasma membrane lipid packing density was studied by means of a widely used membrane fluorescent probe (Laurdan), an amphiphilic molecule whose fluorescence emission is highly sensitive to the microenvironment polarity and viscosity. As a result of a 6-day interaction between tumor cells and fibroblasts in 2D co-cultures, a significant enhancement of both MCF-7 (Figure 7A and 7B) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 8A and 8B) cell membrane fluidity, demonstrated by reduction in GP values, was observed in the GP images and quantified within multiple Regions of Interest (plasma membranes of single cells) for each sample. On the other hand, the poorly invasive MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in the fibroblast membrane packing density (Figure 7A and 7B). After 6 days of co-culture, the GP values of MCF-7 cells and CAFs became nearly the same (GP\u223c0.30). Interestingly, this value corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the GP values of MCF-7 cells alone (GP\u223c0.34) and CAFs alone (GP\u223c0.26). As a result of MCF-7/NF interaction, the same phenomenon occurred (Figure 7A and 7B): the GP value of MCF-7 cells and NFs is again the same (GP\u223c0.32) and corresponds to the arithmetic mean of the GP values of control MCF-7 homotypic cultures (GP\u223c0.34) and control NF homotypic cultures (GP\u223c0.28).Low invasive breast cancer cells and fibroblasts reciprocally influenced their plasma membrane fluidity.Pseudocoloured GP images of living tumor (MCF-7) and fibroblast (NFs or CAFs) cells (A), and reciprocal effects on membrane fluidity (B) are shown. MCF-7 cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with Laurdan (2 \u00b5M). Tumor cell/fibroblast interaction determined an enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity. On the other hand, MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in fibroblast membrane packing density. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05 vs respective homotypic culture.Highly invasive and metastatic breast cancer cells underwent a plasma membrane fluidity increase when co-cultured with normal or cancer-associated fibroblasts.Pseudocoloured GP images of living tumor (MDA-MB-231) and fibroblast (NFs or CAFs) cells (A), and reciprocal effects on plasma membrane fluidity (B) are shown. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with Laurdan (2 \u00b5M). Tumor cell/fibroblast interaction determined an enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity, while MDA-MB-231 cells did not affect fibroblast membrane packing density. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05 vs respective homotypic culture.On the contrary, the highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231cells left unchanged the fibroblast membrane packing density (Figure 8A and 8B).Cancer-associated and normal fibroblasts influenced migration velocity and directness of breast tumor cellsTo test whether fibroblast/cancer cell interactions could influence specific aspects of the cell migratory behaviour, such as velocity and directness, we used single cell tracking of living cells and time-lapse confocal microscopy. We obtained representative trajectory plots of MCF-7 (Figure 9A) or MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9D) evaluated over a time period of 45 min. As shown in Figure 9B, migration velocity was significantly increased in MCF-7 cells co-cultured with NFs () or CAFs (), compared with control MCF-7 homotypic cultures. CAFs seemed to be more efficacious than NFs in promoting this effect which was also associated with an increase in directness of MCF-7 cell movements (Figure 9A, 9B and 9C). The same effects were obtained when the more invasive MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with fibroblasts (Figure 9D, 9E and 9F). On the other hand, the presence of breast cancer cells did not affect the migratory ability of either NFs or CAFs (data not shown).Breast tumor cells displayed increased migration velocity and directness in vitro due to their interaction with fibroblasts.Representative trajectory plots of MCF-7 (A) or MDA-MB-231 cells (D) evaluated over a time period of 45 min. Cells were cultured for 6 days, alone or in presence of NFs or CAFs, in 35 mm glass-bottom Petri dishes and labelled with the CellTracker Green CMFDA. The starting point of each cell trajectory is plotted at the center of the graph. A significant increment of migration velocity (in \u00b5m/min) of MCF-7 (B) or MDA-MB-231 (E) cells was induced by the interaction with both CAFs and NFs. A marked enhancement of the tumor cell migration directness was promoted by CAFs in MCF-7 (A, D) or MDA-MB-231 (C, F) cells. Data are mean\u00b1SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t-test, *p<0.05.DiscussionThe influence of the surrounding stromal environment on breast cancer cell behaviour has been widely recognized but the parameters involved and their relationship are still far from being fully elucidated. Defining the differences between the so called reactive stroma of breast tumors and the normal stroma in terms of their influence on tumor cell migratory/invasive properties is therefore of great interest to deepen the knowledge of the mechanisms responsible of cancer progression and metastasis. In this paper, we used conventional 2D monolayer or 3D cultures to investigate the reciprocal influence occurring between breast cancer cells with different degree of differentiation/invasiveness and fibroblasts derived from breast cancer stroma (CAFs) or their normal counterpart (NFs) on some structural and functional features strongly correlated with the invasive/metastasizing phenotype. We found an overall migration/invasion-promoting effect of CAFs on both low and highly invasive mammary cancer cells, as demonstrated by their ability to increase tumor cell growth, promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition, reduction of cell adhesion, enhancement of membrane fluidity, and migration velocity and directness. These effects were not found or were less intense when cancer cells were grown with NFs under the same experimental conditions. Notably, NFs seem to favour the maintenance of the normal tissue architecture strongly promoting E-cadherin expression. Based on these findings, we conclude that in these experimental models CAFs are able to interact with cancer cells and modulate their migratory behaviour with a greater efficiency, if compared to NFs.In regard to the effect of tumor cell/stroma interaction on cell growth, cohabiting with CAFs induced a clear mitogenic response in both low and highly invasive breast cancer cells, in agreement with previous studies. The MCF-7 cell/CAF and MDA-MB-231/CAF mixed nodules showed a significantly larger proportion of Ki67- or PCNA-positive tumor cells with respect to that observed in the homotypic cultures as well as in the mixed nodule sections of tumor cells and NFs. Even though mammary cancer cells seemed to have no influence on the fibroblast growth, the more invasive and metastatic ones promoted fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation. This effect was revealed by the sharp increase in the percentage of \u03b1-SMA-positive stromal elements found in the CAF population co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 cells which indicates the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype, typical of the breast tumor stroma activation. Consistent with data by other authors, these findings suggest that \u03b1-SMA expression in stromal fibroblast (fibroblast activation in tumor stroma) is influenced by the interacting cancer cell type.Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterizes progression of many types of carcinomas. Changes in intercellular adhesions mediate this switch and dictate the cell receptivity towards signals from the extracellular milieu. In particular, down-regulation or loss of the epithelial adhesion molecule E-cadherin represents a key step in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype for many tumors. This event is frequently associated with the up-regulation of the mesenchymal adhesion protein N-cadherin, strongly influencing cell motility. Indeed, N-cadherin was shown to be expressed in the most invasive and dedifferentiated breast cancer cell lines and its exogenous expression in malignant cells induces a motile scattered phenotype also enabling circulating tumor cells to associate with stromal and endothelial cells at distant sites. A significant result of the present study is NFs' ability to induce a strong E-cadherin enhancement in MCF-7 cells, demonstrated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy on frozen nodule sections. This result disagrees with recent findings by Gao et al., who described a NF-triggered down-regulation of E-cadherin in the same tumor cells by Western blot analysis. On the other hand, consistent with data from these authors, we observed a CAF-triggered reduction of this adhesion molecule. For the first time, in our experience an increase in N-cadherin level was observed in CAFs, but not in NFs, as the result of the interaction with both low and highly invasive breast cancer cells. CAFs, in turn, promoted the up-regulation of N-cadherin in MDA-MB-231 cells and, as previously reported, its de novo expression in MCF-7 cells. The EMT-promoting activity of CAFs, demonstrated by their ability to trigger \u201ccadherin switching\u201d, was corroborated by the induction of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in the well differentiated MCF-7 cells and its up-regulation in the highly dedifferentiated MDA-MB-231 cells. It is conceivable that these CAF-promoted molecular changes of the tumor cell phenotype could have relevant implications in cancer progression and metastasis, not only promoting invasiveness, but also enabling interactions between tumor cells and the N-cadherin-expressing elements of the surrounding microenvironment, also in metastatic niches.Changes in the motional freedom of lipids and protein molecules in the cellular membrane represent a critical feature of pathological cells, influencing several aspects of their behaviour such as the response to chemotherapeutic agents, availability or activation of membrane receptors, migratory, invasive and/or metastatic potential. Even though no univocal trend is evident regarding the direction of alterations in tumor cell membrane fluidity, in most tumors malignant cell membranes have been found to possess higher fluidity than those of their healthy counterparts. It has also been shown that such structural change significantly correlates with an increased migratory/invasive aptitude and malignant potential of tumor cells as well as with a poor prognosis. Therefore, in the present study, two-photon microscopy imaging of cells labelled with the membrane fluorescent probe Laurdan was used to investigate whether fluidity changes in plasma membranes could occur as a result of tumor cell/fibroblast co-culturing. For the first time, we showed that such heterotypic interaction determined a significant enhancement of cancer cell membrane fluidity. On the other hand, the more differentiated and poorly invasive MCF-7 cells promoted an increase in fibroblast membrane packing density whose significance remains to be elucidated.Cell adhesion, changes in membrane phase properties and migration are complex and inter-dependent cellular processes, whose alterations characterize EMT and lead to the acquisition of a more motile phenotype by cancer cells, allowing for tumour invasion and dissemination.Hence, we finally studied the reciprocal influences of stromal and cancer cells on their respective migratory ability. The interaction of both poorly and highly invasive mammary cancer cells with NFs or CAFs determined a definite increment in tumor cell migration velocity. As expected, this migration-promoting activity was particularly noticeable for CAFs which were able to induce even a marked enhancement of the migration directness of breast tumor cells. On the other hand, no influence of breast cancer cells on the fibroblast migratory ability was detected. To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first evidence of the ability of fibroblasts residing in breast tumor stroma to promote both speed and directness of cancer cell migration. In addition, they support results obtained from membrane fluidity analysis.Directional persistence, indicating the existence of a preferential cell track for migration, is an important component of cell motility controlled by multiple factors which include topography of the extracellular environment as well as intrinsic cell properties. It seems conceivable that stroma-induced alterations in specific tumor cell processes, such as cytoskeletal organization, integrin-mediated cell/substratum adhesion or intracellular force creation, have a part in triggering such effect. Future efforts will need to elucidate the CAF-mediated processes that drive tumor cells to migrate on preferential tracks.In summary, our study provides a further insight into the mechanisms involved in breast cancer progression, revealing novel aspects of the reciprocal interactions occurring between malignant cells and the neighbouring fibroblast population. In particular, an overall progression- and invasion-promoting effect of CAFs on both well- and poorly-differentiated mammary cancer cells was expressed as their ability in inducing structural and functional changes favouring the acquisition of a motile and invasive phenotype. Moreover, the tumor cell-triggered enhancement in N-cadherin and \u03b1-SMA levels of CAFs, together with MCF-7 cell-induced rigidification of fibroblast membrane, seems to reflect the ability of breast cancer cells to induce changes in the stromal cell microenvironment, whose significance deserves to be deepened. Defining the reciprocal influence of CAFs and mammary cancer cells on specific cell properties which promote tumor invasion and shedding light on the molecular mechanisms that subtend these effects may help in identifying new key regulators of breast tumor progression.ReferencesBreast stroma plays a dominant regulatory role in breast epithelial growth and differentiation: implications for tumor development and progressionStromal effects on mammary gland development and breast cancerThe role of the microenvironment in mammary gland development and cancerHeterotypic signaling between epithelial tumor cells and fibroblasts in carcinoma formationFibroblasts promote breast cancer cell invasion by upregulating tumor matrix metalloproteinase-9 productionMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerRegulation of in situ to invasive breast carcinoma transitionStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionTumor-associated fibroblasts (part II): Functional impact on tumor tissueInduction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in PMC42-LA human breast carcinoma cells by carcinoma-associated fibroblast secreted factorsEpithelial and stromal cathepsin K and CXCL14 expression in breast tumor progressionBreast cancer cells induce cancer-associated fibroblasts to secrete hepatocyte growth factor to enhance breast tumorigenesisCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts activate progesterone receptors and induce hormone independent mammary tumor growth: A role for the FGF-2/FGFR-2 axisGenetic events and the role of TGF\u03b2 in epithelial tumor progressionMalignant breast epithelium selects for insulin-like growth factor II expression in breast stroma: evidence for paracrine functionFibroblast-mediated acceleration of human epithelial tumor growth in vivoReconstruction of functionally normal and malignant human breast tissues in micePeripheral lymph node stromal cells can promote growth and tumorigenicity of breast carcinoma cells through the release of IGF-I and EGFTumor-stromal interactions reciprocally modulate gene expression patterns during carcinogenesis and metastasisInfluence of the interaction between nodal fibroblast and breast cancer cells on gene expressionCharacterization of heterotypic interaction effects in vitro to deconvolute global gene expression profiles in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of co-cultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsA method for three-dimensional coculture of cancer cells combined to any other type of cells maintained organotypicallyJanus-faced liposomes enhance antimicrobial innate immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infectionPE_PGRS30 is required for the full virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosisCalmodulin-dependent kinase IV links Toll-like receptor 4 signaling with survival pathway of activated dendritic cellsLow density lipoprotein misfolding and amyloidogenesisDynamic organization of lymphocyte plasma membrane: lessons from advanced imaging methodsVisualizing lipid structure and raft domains in living cells with two-photon microscopyHeat stress causes spatially-distinct membrane re-modelling in K562 leukemia cellsHigh-resolution imaging of redox signaling in live cells through an oxidation-sensitive yellow fluorescent proteinInvestigation of the spatial distribution of glutathione redox-balance in live cells by using Fluorescence Ratio Imaging MicroscopyCan redox-sensitive fluorescent probes measure intracellular redox potentials?Compartmentalization of the redox environment in PC-12 neuronal cellsNutrient withdrawal rescues growth factor-deprived cells from mTOR-dependent damageMammalian life-span determinant p66 shcA mediates obesity-induced insulin resistanceControlled self assembly of collagen nanoparticleRole of the life span determinant P66shcA in ethanol-induced liver damageImaging in Cell and Developmental BiologyFeature point tracking and trajectory analysis for video imaging in cell biologyMardia Kanti V, Jupp PE (1999) Directional Statistics.

Breast carcinomas are composed of tumor cells and different types of non-carcinogenic cells that constitute tumor stroma. It became clear that the carcinoma-stroma interplay is critical for carcinogenesis through intercellular cross-talk. Fibroblasts, the most common and the most active type of stromal cells, are known as reactive fibroblasts, myofibroblasts or cancer-associated fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts have a prominent role in the growth, progression and spread of tumor cells through active release of various growth factors, cytokines and chemokines such as TGF-\u03b21, SDF-1 and IL-6. The active status of myofibroblasts is sustained even in absence of the activating signal, due mainly to the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop that links inflammation to cancer. One of the important members of this loop is the Let-7b, which belongs to the let-7 family of microRNAs. Members of this family are highly conserved in sequence and function from C. elegans to humans, and play important roles in several physiological and pathological processes such as development, differentiation as well as carcinogenesis. Functionally, let-7 family members act as tumor suppressor in several types of malignant human tumors by inhibiting the expression of oncogenes and key regulators of mitogenic pathways. Indeed, the expression of let-7 family members has been found reduced in many types of cancers. Furthermore, it has been shown that the restoration of let-7b expression effectively inhibited the growth of lung and breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as in mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma. Importantly, it has been recently reported that let-7b expression was reduced in breast cancer tissues and was inversely associated with tumor lymph node metastasis, patient overall survival and relapse-free survival. Furthermore, breast cancer patients with low let-7b expression had poor prognoses, indicating that let-7b could act as tumor suppressor miRNA in breast cancer onset and spread.In the present report, we have shown that let-7b suppresses the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast cancer-associated fibroblasts through negative regulation of IL-8.RESULTSBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts express low level of let-7b, and specific inhibition of let-7b activates breast stromal fibroblastsTo investigate the importance of let-7b in breast stromal fibroblasts (BSF) activation and the carcinoma-stroma functional interplay, we first assessed the level of this microRNA in 13 CAFs and their corresponding tumor counterpart fibroblasts (TCFs) derived from the same patients and cultured simultaneously. Total RNA was purified from these cells and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to amplify/quantify the let-7b microRNA. Figure 1A shows let-7b down-regulation in all CAFs relative to their corresponding TCFs, with great difference between the different pairs. This prompted us to test the possible implication of let-7b down-regulation in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, normal breast stromal fibroblasts (TCF-346) were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control sequence (TCF-346c) for 24 h, and then the levels of let-7b and its downstream targets were assessed by qRT-PCR. Figure 1B shows that let-7b level was significantly reduced, with concomitant strong up-regulation of IL-6 (12 fold) in TCF-346i as compared to control cells. Similarly, let-7b inhibition increased the levels of miR-21 and RELA that codes for NF-\u03baB (p65), while it reduced the level of PTEN as compared to the control cells (Figure 1B). These results suggest that let-7b inhibition activated the IL-6-related positive feedback loop. To confirm this observation, we tested the effect of let-7b inhibition on the expression of Lin28B and the activation of STAT3 and AKT, three major components of the loop. To this end, cell lysates were prepared from TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, and proteins were used for immunoblotting analysis. We first confirmed that let-7b inhibition increased the expression of IL-6 at the protein level as well (Figure 1C). Subsequently, we have shown that let-7b inhibition activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and AKT (p-AKT), and up-regulated Lin28B, an inhibitor of let-7b (Figure 1C). This indicates that the inhibition of let-7b function activated the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop in BSFs. Thereby, we tested the effect of let-7b inhibition on the activation of BSFs by assessing the levels of the three major markers of active fibroblasts (ACTA2 (\u03b1-SMA), SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b21). Interestingly, let-7b inhibitor increased the mRNA levels of these three genes as compared to the negative control (Figure 1D). On the other hand, the level of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A was decreased in TCF-346i as compared to controls (Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained when TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells were passaged once and were reincubated in let-7b inhibitor-free medium (Supplementary Figure 1). These results suggest that let-7b inhibition activates breast stromal fibroblasts.Let-7b inhibition activates breast stromal fibroblasts through the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop(A) Total RNA was purified from the indicated 13 CAF/TCF pairs (T64 to T900), and the level of let-7b was assessed by qRT-PCR. The values obtained in CAFs were divided by the values of their corresponding TCFs, and then were plotted. (B and D) TCF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control (TCF-346c) for 48 h, and then medium was replaced with inhibitor-free medium for 24 h. Total RNA was purified and used for qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 3 independent experiments (*P < 0.05 and **P<0.001). (C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells, and were used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins, and GAPDH was utilized as internal control. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. For the phosphorylated proteins, the levels were determined relative to their respective non-phosphorylated forms.Let-7b inhibition stably activates breast stromal fibroblastsWe then asked whether let-7b inhibition-dependent activation of the loop and BSFs is permanent or transient. Therefore, the medium-containing let-7b inhibitor was removed and replaced with let-7b inhibitor-free medium for 48 h, and then cells were passaged and re-incubated in inhibition-free medium (IFM) 4 times. Figure 2A shows that let-7b remained down-regulated while the levels of miR-21, IL-6, RELA and Lin28B remained up-regulated in TCF-346i relative to controls, despite the removal of the let-7b inhibitor and cells were passaged several times. These findings were confirmed in other cells (TCF-64) (Supplementary Figure 2A), and at the protein level for IL-6 and Lin28B (Figure 2B). Furthermore, let-7b inhibition activated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and AKT (p-AKT) (Figure 2B). These results indicate that the transient let-7b inhibition activates the positive feedback loop in a persistent manner. Therefore, we also confirmed the persistent activation of BSFs upon let-7b inhibition by showing sustained up-regulation of the \u03b1-SMA protein (Figure 2B) and mRNA (Figure 2C) in TCF-346i relative to TCF-346c. Likewise, the levels of the SDF-1 and TGF \u03b2 -1 mRNAs also remained higher in TCF-346i and TCF-64i relative to their respective controls (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 2B, respectively). On the other hand, the CDKN2A gene remained repressed (Figure 2C). This suggests that let-7b inhibition persistently transformed breast stromal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts likely through the activation of the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop. To confirm this, we decided to investigate the effect of let-7b inhibition on the invasion/migration abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts. Therefore, exponentially growing TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, in IFM and after many passaging, were seeded on the upper chamber wells of the CIM plates 16 with serum-free medium (SFM), while lower chamber wells contained complete medium (CpM). The invasion and migration of cells were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Figure 2E shows increase in the invasion/migration abilities of TCF-346i cells as compared to TCF-346c cells. Using the same system, we have also shown that the proliferation rate of TCF-346i cells was higher than control cells (Figure 2E). This indicates that let-7b inhibition persistently increased the invasion/migration and proliferation abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts, which confirms their sustained activation. This was confirmed at the molecular level by showing the persistent activation of ERK1/2 and the up-regulation of MMP9 in TCF-346i cells as compared to controls (Figure 2F).Let-7b inhibition persistently activates STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop and enhances the invasion/migration/proliferation abilities of breast stromal fibroblastsTCF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b inhibitor (TCF-346i) or control (TCF-346c) for 48 h, and then the medium-containing let-7b inhibitor was removed and replaced with let-7b inhibitor-free medium for 24 h, and then cells were passaged and re-incubated in inhibitor-free medium 4 times. (A and C) Total RNA was purified from the indicated cells and used for qRT-PCR. Experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 3 independent experiments (*P < 0.05 and **P<0.001).

(D and E) Exponentially growing TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells (104) in let-7b inhibitor-free medium were added independently into the upper chambers of the 16-well CIM-plates (invasion/migration), while the bottom chambers contained complete medium. For proliferation, cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of complete medium. Cell invasion, migration and proliferation were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.Let-7b inhibition in breast fibroblasts triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in an IL-8-dependent paracrine fashionTo further show the permanent active status of TCF-346i cells, we sought to test their paracrine effects. To perform this, serum-free medium (SFM) was conditioned with TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells for 24 h, and then the resulting serum-free conditioned media (SFCM) (TCF-346c-SFCM and TCF-346i-SFCM, respectively) were first used to assess the effect of let-7b knock-down on the secretion of various cytokines using the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody arrays. Great differential levels of various cytokines were observed between TCF-346c and TCF-346i cells, including, GRO, IL-6, IL-8 and IGFBP2 (Figure 3A, 3B). These results were confirmed by ELISA for the most prominent protein IL-8. Indeed, the secreted level of this pro-carcinogenic cytokine was significantly increased in TCF-346i cells compared to controls (Figure 3B).Let-7b inhibition triggers EMT in breast cancer cells in a paracrine manner(A) TCF-346i and TCF-346c cells were incubated for 24 h in SFM and the resulting SFCM (TCF-346i-SFCM and TCF-346c-SFCM, respectively) were applied to cytokine array membranes.

(D and E) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the upper chambers of the CIM plates in presence of the indicated media, while the bottom chambers contained SFM. For proliferation, cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of the indicated SFCM. The migration/invasion and proliferation abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate. (F) Whole cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. (G) MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in TCF-346c-SFCM or TCF-346i-SFCM media containing either IgG (TCF-346i-SFCM + IgG) or neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) (TCF-346i-SFCM + \u03b1IL-8), and then whole cell lysates were prepared and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. (H) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the upper chambers of the CIM plates in presence of the indicated media, while the bottom chambers contained SFM, and migration and invasion abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.To test the paracrine effects of TCF-346i cells on breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on the upper chamber wells of the CIM plates 16 with SFM, while the lower chamber wells contained TCF-346c-SFCM or TCF-346i-SFCM. The migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Figure 3C shows increase in the migration and invasion capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TCF-346i-SFCM as compared to those treated with TCF-346c-SFCM. Similarly, TCF-346i-SFCM enhanced the proliferation rate of MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to controls (Figure 3D).In addition, we tested the effect of TCF-346c-SFCM and TCF-346i-SFCM on the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in MDA-MB-231 cells by immunoblotting. Figure 3E shows that TCF-346i-SFCM down-regulated both epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam, while it increased the level of the mesenchymal markers ZEB1, Twist1 and Snail relative to cells exposed to TCF-346c-SFCM. Similarly, the stemness marker ALDH was also up-regulated (Figure 3E). This shows that TCF-346i cells enhanced the EMT process in MDA-MB-231 cells in a paracrine manner, which further confirms the active status of let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts.Since let-7b inhibition strongly increased the expression/secretion of IL-8, we hypothesized the possible implication of this cytokine in the paracrine pro-EMT effects of TCF-346i cells. To verify this, we neutralized IL-8 in TCF-346i-SFCM using specific antibody, while IgG was utilized as control, and then MDA-MB-231 cells were treated as described above. Figure 3F shows that neutralizing IL-8 inhibited the pro-EMT process of TCF-346i-SFCM relative to cells treated with TCF-346i-SFCM containing IgG. Similarly, adding the neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibody to TCF-346i-SFCM inhibited its pro-migratory and -invasive effects as compared to cells exposed to TCF-346i-SFCM containing IgG, reaching a level similar to that obtained with TCF-346c-SFCM (Figure 3G). This indicates that the paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects of let-7b-deficient BSF are IL-8-related.Let-7b deficient fibroblasts stimulate breast cancer orthotopic tumor growth in miceTo investigate the effect of let-7b inhibition in human breast fibroblasts on tumor growth in vivo, orthotopic breast tumor xenografts were created under the nipples the 4th left fat pad of nude mice by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (2x106) with either TCF-346i or TCF-346c cells (2x106), which were passaged 4 times post-transfection. Tumors bearing TCF-346i fibroblasts (T-TCF346i) appeared earlier and grew much faster relative to those having control cells (T-TCF346c) (Figure 4A). This indicates that let-7b-deficient BSFs can enhance orthotopic tumor growth in mice. Interestingly, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed more necrosis in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c (Figure 4B). This shows that let-7b-deficient BSFs enhance tumor aggressiveness.Let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts enhance orthotopic tumor growthOrthotopic breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with TCF-346c or TCF-346i cells under the nipple of the 4th left fat pad of nude mice. (A) The histogram shows the volumes of xenograft tumors that were measured at the indicated time points. (B) Tissues were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining (Envision 40x). (C) Orthotopic tumors bearing TCF-346c cells (T-TCF-346c) or TCF-346i cells (T-TCF-346i) were excised and whole cell lysates were prepared and protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. (D) Excised tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry against the indicated proteins.Additionally, whole cell extracts were prepared from T-TCF346i and T-TCF346i tissues, and the levels of various cancer- and metastasis-promoting genes were assessed by immunoblotting. Figure 4C shows that T-TCF346i tumors express higher level of the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, ZEB1, Twsit1 and vimentin, while E-cadherin and EpCAM levels were lower as compared to T-TCF346c tumors. This confirms the in vitro results showing the enhancement of the EMT process by let-7b-deficient fibroblasts. In addition, TCF346i cells increased the level of the stemness markers CD44 and ALDH and the pluripotency markers KLF4 and SOX-2 relative to TCF346c cells (Figure 4C). Figure 4C also shows strong increase in the expression levels of the downstream proliferation effectors cyclin D1 and C-Myc in T-TCF346i tumors relative to controls. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry showing higher Ki-67 staining in T-TCF346i tissue relative to controls (Figure 4D). This shows that the presence of let-7b-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts enhanced the growth as well as the EMT/stemness processes in breast cancer cells in orthotopic xenografts. In addition, let-7b-deficient BSFs enhanced the formation of new blood vessels in orthotopic tumors as shown by the strong increase in the staining of the endothelial cells marker CD34 in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c (Figure 4D). This indicates that let-7b-deficient BSFs promote angiogenesis in a paracrine manner. This could result from increase in the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors. Indeed, the levels of IL-8, HIF-1\u03b1 and its downstream target VEGF-A were higher in T-TCF346i as compared to T-TCF346c, which explains the strong increase in the neo-vascularization shown in the tumors bearing TCF346i fibroblasts (Figure 4C, 4D).Let-7b mimic stably inhibits the STAT3/NF- \u03baB/let-7b autocrine positive feedback loop and represses active breast fibroblastsTo further confirm the role of let-7b in the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts, we investigated the effect of increased level of let-7b on active BSFs. Therefore, CAF-346 and CAF-64 cells were transfected with let-7b mimic (CAF-346m and CAF-64m, respectively) or a control sequence (CAF-346c and CAF-64c, respectively) for 24 h, and then total RNA was purified and the level of the let-7b microRNA was assessed. Figures 5A and Supplementary Figure 3A show highly significant increase in the level of let-7b in CAF-346m and CAF-64m as compared to their respective controls. Expectedly, the mRNA level of the let-7b downstream target IL-6 was significantly decreased in CAF-346m relative to controls (Figure 5A). Similar effect was observed for miR-21, RELA and lin28B, whilst PTEN was up-regulated in CAF-346m as compared to the control cells (Figure 5A). Furthermore, let-7b mimic reduced the protein levels of IL-6, Lin28B, active STAT3 (p-STAT3) as well as active AKT (p-AKT) (Figure 5B). This indicates that the increase in the amount of let-7b inhibited the IL-6-dependent positive feedback loop. Concomitantly, the increase in the level of let-7b decreased the mRNA levels of the 3 main myofibroblast markers (ACTA2, SDF-1 and TGF-\u03b21), while up-regulated CDKN2A in CAF-346m as compared to control cells (Figure 5C). This indicates that the increase in the amount of let-7b inactivated myofibroblats through inhibiting the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b autocrine positive feedback loop. Indeed, let-7b mimic transformed the shape of cells from large and flat (characteristic of myofibroblasts) to rounded spindle-shaped, which characterize normal fibroblasts (Figure 6A). To test the persistent effect of let-7b mimic, cells were passaged several times, and then the expression of different relevant genes was assessed. Importantly, let-7b level was reduced in both CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S relative to their respective control cells (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 3B). On the other hand, IL-6, miR-21, RELA and lin28B remained down-regulated while PTEN remained up-regulated in CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S cells relative to controls (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 3B). At the protein levels, the IL-6 and Lin28B levels remained reduced, while STAT3 and AKT remained inactive (Figure 6C). Moreover, the level of \u03b1-SMA remained reduced at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 6C and 6D). The lower levels of SDF-1 and TGF \u03b2-1 were also sustained, while the CDKN2A mRNA levels remained up-regulated in CAF-346m-S and CAF-64m-S as compared to their respective control cells (Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure 3C). This was confirmed by showing reduced migratory, invasive and proliferative capacities of CAF-346m-S cells relative to controls (Figure 6E and 6F). These cellular results were corroborated with decrease in the levels of p-ERK1/2 and MMP-9 in CAF-346m-S as compared to CAF-346c-S cells (Figure 6G). These results indicate that ectopic increase in let-7b level stably reverted myofibroblasts to inactive fibroblasts through inactivation of the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b feedback loop.Increase in the level of let-7b inactivates the STAT3/NF-\u03baB/let-7b positive feedback loop and suppresses myofibroblastsCAF-346 cells were transfected with let-7b mimic (CAF-346m) or a control sequence (CAF-346c) for 48 h, and then the medium-containing let-7b mimic was removed and replaced with let-7b mimic-free medium for 24 h.

(C and G) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and used for immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against the indicated proteins, and GAPDH was utilized as internal control. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. For the phosphorylated proteins, the levels were determined relative to their respective non-phosphorylated forms. (E) Exponentially growing cells (104) were added independently into the upper chambers of the 16-well CIM-plates, while the bottom chambers contained complete medium. (F) cells were seeded in the E-plates in the presence of complete medium, and cell proliferation was assessed for 72 h. Cell invasion/migration and proliferation were assessed using the RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate.Furthermore, ELISA indicates significant decrease in the secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF-A from CAF-346m-S relative to controls (Figure 7A). This prompted us to investigate the paracrine effect of CAF-346m-S cells and their corresponding controls on breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. To perform this, SFM were conditioned with CAF-346c-S and CAF-346m-S cells for 24 h, and then the resulting SFCM were added to MDA-MB-231 cells. Figure 7B shows decrease in the invasive/migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CAF-346m-S.SFCM as compared to those treated with CAF-346c-SFCM. Furthermore, CAF-346m-S.SFCM up-regulated the epithelial makers (E-cadherin and EpCAM), whilst it reduced the levels of the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, ZEB1, Twist1 and Snail) (Figure 7C). This suggests that CAF-346m-S.SFCM inhibits the EMT process in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Likewise, CAF-346m-S.SFCM reduced the expression level of the stemness marker ALDH (Figure 7C). Together, these results indicate that let-7b mimic represses the procarcinogenic effects of active breast stromal fibroblasts.Overexpression of let-7b by mimic decreased cancer-promoting abilities of breast myofibroblasts(A) SFCM from the indicated cells were collected, and the levels of the indicated proteins were determined by ELISA and were presented in the respective histograms. Error bars indicate mean \u00b1 S.D. **, P<0.001 (n=3). (B) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in the presence of the indicated SFCM as described in Figure 2D, and then the migration and invasion abilities were assessed by the real time RTCA-DP xCELLigence System. Data are representative of different experiments performed in triplicate. (C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from MDA-MB-231 cells treated as indicated and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH.IL-8 is under the control of let-7b and is highly expressed in CAF cellsBased on the results obtained in Figure 3, we sought to investigate the possible implication of let-7b in the control of IL-8 expression. Therefore, the IL-8 mRNA and protein levels were assessed in CAF-346m, TCF-346i and their respective control cells CAF-346c and TCF-346c. Figure 8A shows that while let-7b mimic significantly reduced the level of the IL-8 mRNA, let-7b inhibition strongly up-regulated IL-8 as compared to their respective controls. This let-7b-dependent expression of the IL-8 mRNA was also observed at the protein level (Figure 8B). This indicates that let-7b negatively controls the expression of IL-8. Thereby, we assessed the IL-8 level in various CAF/TCF pairs derived from different breast cancer patients and also normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) derived from plastic surgery. Figure 8C shows that the IL-8 expression level was higher in 8 out of 9 (89%) CAFs relative to their corresponding TCFs, and in all TCF cells as compared to NBFs. Indeed, IL-8 was almost undetectable in NBFs, while CAFs exhibited the highest levels (Figure 8D). This mirrors let-7b down-regulation in the majority of CAF cells compared to their TCF counterparts (Figure 1A).Let-7b negatively controls IL-8, which is highly expressed in CAF cells(A) Total RNA was purified from the indicated cells, and IL-8 level was assessed by qRT-PCR using specific primers. Experiments were performed in triplicate and several times; error bars represent means \u00b1 S.D, values of 2 independent experiments (**,P < 0.001). (B and C) Whole cell lysates were prepared from the indicated cells and were used for immunoblotting using antibodies against the indicated proteins. The numbers under the bands represent fold changes relative to GAPDH. (D) Box plot showing IL-8 expression levels in the indicated types of breast fibroblasts as determined in Figure 8C.DISCUSSIONAccumulating evidence indicates that microRNAs play major roles in both the onset as well as the progression of various types of cancer, including breast carcinomas. These effects are not only autocrine, but also paracrine and through secreted exosomes. Indeed, these small non-coding RNAs are both mediators and communicators between cancer cells and their microenvironment. MicroRNAs play also important roles in modulating the biology of cancer-associated fibroblasts towards a more permissive pro-tumoral phenotype. In the present report, we have shown that the tumor suppressor microRNA let-7b is down-regulated in most breast cancer-associated fibroblasts compared to their adjacent paired TCFs; and specific let-7b inhibition granted BSFs with traits of activated fibroblasts, including enhanced migration/invasion and proliferation. Like in cancer cells, this effect was persistent through the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feedback loop, which is responsible for the persistent activation of BSFs. The activation of this loop may also provide a molecular explanation for let-7b down-regulation in CAFs. Indeed, let-7b inhibitor Lin28B, is up-regulated in response to the induction of the IL-6 feedback loop in both cancer and fibroblast cells. Previously, Zhao et al have identified several dysregulated miRNAs in breast CAFs, and miR-200 family members were severely suppressed. Subsequently, they have shown that downregulation of miR200s activated breast stromal fibroblasts. Similarly, it has been shown that miR-26b is down-regulated in CAFs from ER-positive breast cancers, and when specifically down-regulated it activated normal breast fibroblasts. This indicates that several miRNAs, like the important tumor suppressor genes p16, p53 and PTEN, also suppress breast stromal fibroblasts, may be through repressing their target onco/inflammatory genes. Several publications have reported the role of microRNAs in activating stromal fibroblasts through modulating the expression of important inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and CCL5. Likewise, we have shown here that let-7b also controls the secretion of several important cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, Gro, Gro-\u03b1 and others (Figure 3A). This prompted us to investigate the paracrine effects of let-7b-deficient BSFs. Importantly, let-7b inhibition enhanced the pro-carcinogenic effects of BSFs in a paracrine manner both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xenografts. These extracellular effects of let-7b-deficient cells are IL-8-dependent. Indeed, these cells secreted high levels of IL-8, and specific inhibition of this cytokine in the corresponding SFCM suppressed the paracrine induction of the EMT process in breast cancer cells (Figure 3). In fact, let-7b represses the expression of IL-8 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Since IL-8 is not a target of let-7b and its 3\u2019UTR does not contain specific let-7b seeding site, this let-7b-dependent regulation of IL-8 expression could be indirect through the IL-6/STAT3/NF-\u03baB positive feed back loop. It is well known that IL-8 is a target of the transcription factors STAT3 and NF-\u03baB. Similarly, the expression of IL-8 was inhibited in H.pylori infected gastric epithelial cells with let-7b overexpression and the consequent NF-\u03baB down-regulation. This shows that let-7b negatively controls 2 major imflammatory/cancer-related cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. This was confirmed by showing that most CAFs express high level of IL-8 as compared to their corresponding TCFs. Additionally, we have shown that TCFs, which were generated from histologically normal breast tissues, exhibited higher levels of IL-8 relative to those observed in normal breast fibroblasts. This confirms that TCFs have some active features as previously shown, and thereby may play important roles in local recurrence.Interestingly, inhibition of let-7b in BSF promoted breast cancer tumor growth, EMT, stemness and angiogenesis in orthotopic humanized tumors, which indicates that let-7b has non-cell-autonomous tumor suppressive functions. These could be mediated through several cancer-promoting factors such as IL-6 and IL-8.These results were strengthened through overexpression of let-7b by mimic in active CAF cells wherein phenotypes of normal breast fibroblasts were restored. Indeed, CAF cells became fusiform, they expressed lower levels of \u03b1-SMA, SDF-1, TGF-\u03b21 and IL-8, they were less migratory/invasive and proliferative, with strong reduction in their paracrine pro-carcinogenic effects. These data further confirmed the tumor suppressive function of let-7b. Likewise, ectopic expression of miR-200s in CAFs partially restored normal features of breast fibroblasts. Similarly, re-expression of miR-31 in CAFs inhibited their capacity to promote endometrial tumor cell migration and invasion. This conversion from active CAFs to normal fibroblasts by miRNAs was also observed in ovarian CAFs. This indicates that several miRNAs are key players in suppressing the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts through post-transcriptional gene regulation.In summary, the present findings indicate that let-7b down-regulation is an important step toward the activation of breast stromal fibroblasts. On the other hand, increase in the let-7b level by mimic normalizes active breast myofibroblasts, and consequently can be utilized to enhance the efficiency of the classical anti-cancer regimen.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblast cells were obtained and used as previously described. MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC and were authenticated at ATCC before purchase by their standard short tandem repeat DNA typing methodology, and were routinely tested for the presence of the relevant markers, and were cultured following the instructions of the company.

Cell migration and invasion were assessed as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, 2x104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper wells of the CIM-plate with thin layer of matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration), and a complete media was added to the lower chamber wells used as a chemo-attractant. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in the RTCA for 24 h and the impedance value of each well was automatically monitored by the xCELLigence system and expressed as a Cell index value which represents cell status based on the measured electrical impedance change divided by a background value. Each assay was performed in triplicate.For the proliferation assay, exponentially growing cells (2\u00d7104) were seeded in E-plate with complete medium as per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. All data were recorded and analyzed by the RTCA software. Cell index (CI) was used to measure the change in the electrical impedance divided by the background value to represent cell status. Each assay was performed in triplicate.Immunohistochemistry staining on FFPE tissuesImmunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues was performed using anti-Ki-67 and CD34 antibodies (Abcam) at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:150, respectively, and then slides were stained using automated staining platform (Ventana). Envision + polymer (ready to use; Dako) was used as a secondary antibody. Color was developed with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and instant hematoxylin (Shandon) was used for counterstaining.Orthotopic tumor xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH&RC institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. 10 female nude mice were randomized into 2 groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by coimplantation of the MDA-MB-231 cells (2 \u00d7 106) with TCF-346i or TCF-346c cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of the 4th left fat pad of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper using the following formula (Length X Width X Height).Conditioned mediaCells were cultured in medium without serum for 24 h, and then media were collected and briefly centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at -80\u00b0C until needed.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by student\u2019s t-test and P values of 0.05 and less were considered as statistically significant.QuantificationsThe expression levels of the immunoblotted proteins were measured using the Image J software. Protein signal intensity of each band was determined, and then dividing the obtained value of each band by the values of the corresponding internal control allowed a correction of the loading differences.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNo competing interests are declared by any of the authors.REFERENCESGlobal cancer statistics, 2012Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts: orchestrating the composition of malignancyFibroblasts in cancerThe inflammatory/cancer-related IL-6/STAT3/NF-kappaB positive feedback loop includes AUF1 and maintains the active state of breast myofibroblastsAberrant regulation of the LIN28A/LIN28B and let-7 loop in human malignant tumors and its effects on the hallmarks of cancerDisrupting the pairing between let-7 and Hmga2 enhances oncogenic transformationLet-7 and miR-200 microRNAs: guardians against pluripotency and cancer progressionThe LIN28/let-7 pathway in cancerRegression of murine lung tumors by the let-7 microRNAlet-7 regulates self renewal and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cellsPrognostic significance of let-7b expression in breast cancer and correlation to its target gene of BSG expressionMicroRNAs in cancerBreast cancer and microRNAs: therapeutic impactMicroRNA regulation of human breast cancer stem cellsMicroRNAs as mediators and communicators between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironmentEssential role of miRNAs in orchestrating the biology of the tumor microenvironmentmicroRNA-mediated regulation of the tumor microenvironmentMicroRNA regulation in cancer-associated fibroblastsSTAT3 activation of miR-21 and miR-181b-1 via PTEN and CYLD are part of the epigenetic switch linking inflammation to cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingMiRNA expression analysis of cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal fibroblasts in breast cancerMiR-26b is down-regulated in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts from ER-positive breast cancers leading to enhanced cell migration and invasionRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisp16(INK4A) Represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMicroRNAs reprogram normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts in ovarian cancerEpigenetic silencing of microRNA-149 in cancer-associated fibroblasts mediates prostaglandin E2/interleukin-6 signaling in the tumor microenvironmentMechanisms underlying differential expression of interleukin-8 in breast cancer cellsLet-7b is involved in the inflammation and immune responses associated with Helicobacter pylori infection by targeting Toll-like receptor 4Breast stromal fibroblasts from histologically normal surgical margins are pro-carcinogenicThe role of miR-31 and its target gene SATB2 in cancer-associated fibroblastsBreast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their counterparts display neoplastic-specific changesThe p16INK4a tumor suppressor controls p21WAF1 induction in response to ultraviolet light"

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumour initiation and progression, possibly by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a series of cellular changes that is known to underlie the process of metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether CAFs and surrounding normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) are able to induce EMT markers and functional changes in breast epithelial cancer cells. Matched pairs of CAFs and NBFs were established from fresh human breast cancer specimens and characterised by assessment of CXCL12 levels, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels and response to doxorubicin. The fibroblasts were then co-cultured with MCF7 cells. Vimentin and E-cadherin expressions were determined in co-cultured MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as by western blotting and quantitative PCR. Co-cultured MCF7 cells were also assessed functionally by invasion assay. CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and expressed higher levels of \u03b1-SMA compared with NBFs. CAFs were also less sensitive to doxorubicin as evidenced by less H2AX phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis on flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V compared with NBFs. When co-cultured with MCF7 cells, there was greater vimentin and less E-cadherin expression as well as greater invasiveness in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CAFs compared with those co-cultured with NBFs. CAFs have the ability to induce a greater degree of EMT in MCF7 cell lines, indicating that CAFs contribute to a more malignant breast cancer phenotype and their role in influencing therapy resistance should therefore be considered when treating breast cancer.",

Despite significant advancements in the treatment of other breast cancer subtypes, there is still no licensed targeted therapy available for the treatment of TNBC, and therefore little improvement in survival has been observed for this patient population over the last years. This highlights the need for better understanding of TNBC and identification of mechanisms involved in disease progression and treatment response.It is now well recognized that breast cancer progression can be influenced by a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment surrounding the malignant epithelial cells. This environment consists of a heterogeneous mixture of stromal cells, including a diversity of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a biological active network comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM), in addition to the interstitial fluid and its solutes. New knowledge about the components of the microenvironment and how they interact with tumor cells can hopefully identify new biomarkers or potential targets in TNBC.The aberrant stroma affects the physiological forces within the tumor. Indeed, the hydrostatic pressure in the tumor interstitium, known as interstitial fluid pressure (PIF), is considerably increased in the majority of solid tumors, including human breast cancer, and this poses a major physiological barrier to transport of soluble factors within the tumor.Increased PIF has been shown to predict poor prognosis in some solid tumors, and can also hinder effective delivery of drugs into the tumor. Finding ways to lower tumor PIF may therefore increase efficiency of cancer therapy.Fibroblasts can actively modify PIF and transcapillary fluid exchange (reviewed in) and the molecular mechanisms are outlined by collagen contraction assays and heterospheroids, as well as parallel in vivo experiments. Dysfunctional blood and lymph vessels will lead to fluid accumulation in the tumor interstitium, and swelling of hyaluronan and proteoglycans would in normal conditions hinder an increase in PIF. Tension exerted by fibroblasts and collagen network can probably counteract this swelling, resulting in a persistent increased PIF. However, although fibroblast-mediated contraction has previous been shown to be dependent on \u03b21-integrins, fibroblast-mediated PIF influence is still not fully understood.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is a collagen binding integrin expressed during differentiation of myofibroblasts and is involved in collagen organization and tumor stiffness. As a collagen organizer and a link between contractile fibroblasts and the complex collagen network, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 could be a regulator of tumor PIF. Although a few studies indicate that it has a physiological role in the regulation of PIF in dermis, its influence on PIF in tumors remains to be demonstrated. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate pressure homeostasis within a tumor, can probably lead to a new insight into breast carcinogenesis, and we therefore investigated the effect of stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency on pressure homeostasis, ECM organization and tumor growth using two human TNBC xenograft models.MethodsCell linesMDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) was provided by Professor James Lorens (University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway), and MDA-MB-468 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-132\u2122) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA., USA). The MDA-MB-231 cells were fingerprinted before use and matched with the cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC\u00ae HTB-26\u2122) in the ATCC database. MDA-MB-231 was used at passage number five to nine, while the MDA-MB-468 cells were used at passage number two to five. These TNBC cell lines have high tumor take in SCID mice and slowly forming tumors, which may be more stromal dependent than more rapidly growing xenografts. Wild type (WT) and integrin \u03b111-deficient (\u03b111-KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from mouse embryos of embryonic day 14.5 as described previously. In order to obtain immortalized MEFs, primary MEF cultures were infected with recombinant retrovirus-transducing simian virus 40 (SV40). All cell lines were grown in Nutrient Mixture F-12 Ham (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) supplemented with 10% Foetal Bovine Serum, 100\u2009units/ml penicillin, 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 1\u20132% L-glutamine (all from Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were grown as single monolayers in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and in all experiments used at log phase. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.Xenograft modelsThe integrin \u03b111-deficient heterozygous SCID mouse strain was generated as previously described. PCR-genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from ear biopsies. The animals were kept in individually ventilated cages, cared for regularly and efforts were made to age- and weight match the animals. All animal experiments were approved by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Permit Number 20168751) which is the competent body responsible for authorizing research projects in animals in Norway. This is in accordance with the EU directive 2010/63 article 36.A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 or 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-468 tumor cells in 0.15\u2009ml PBS were injected into the fourth mammary fat pad (orthotopic), and for the MDA-MB-231 also subcutaneously on the mouse flank (ectopic). Tumor size was measured using a caliper. The tumor volume was calculated using the formula; tumor volume (mm3)\u2009=\u2009(\u03c0/6)\u2009\u00d7\u2009a2\u00a0\u00d7\u2009b, where a represents the shortest diameter and b represents the longest diameter of the tumor. All animals were anesthetized using Isofluran (Isoba\u00aevet. 100%, Schering-Plough A/S, Farum, Denmark) and eventually sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia. For investigation of the primary tumor, all the MDA-MB-231 injected mice were sacrificed day 57 post injection. For the MDA-MB-468 injected mice, some of the tumors showed tendency to ulcerate the skin, and these mice were sacrificed immediately. To make the groups comparable, one mouse from the opposite group and with similar tumor load was sacrificed on the same day.To evaluate metastatic spread to the lungs, they were processed and fixed as previously described (n\u2009=\u20095 WT and 5 \u03b111-KO and n\u2009=\u20095 WT and 4 \u03b111-KO for the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 injected mice, respectively).All measurements and analysis in this study were performed blinded to genotype.Measurement of interstitial fluid pressureThe wick-in-needle technique was used to measure the tumor PIF. Briefly, a standard 23-gauge needle with a side hole filled with nylon floss and saline was connected to a PE-50 catheter, a pressure transducer and a computer for pressure registrations, using the software Powerlab chart (version 5, PowerLab/ssp. AD instruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). The needle was inserted into the central part of the tumor after calibration. After a period of stable pressure measurements, the fluid communication was tested by clamping the catheter which shall cause a transient rise and then return to pressure prior to clamping. Measurements were accepted if the pre- to post-clamping value was within \u00b11\u2009mmHg.PIF in heterospheroids was measured with the micropuncture technique described previously. Briefly, the spheroids were collected and transferred to 10-cm Lysine-coated cell culture dishes (Nunc, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA., USA) and left to attach for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. PIF was measured using sharpened glass capillaries (tip diameter 3\u20135\u2009\u03bcm) connected to a servo-controlled counter pressure system. The glass capillaries were filled with hypertonic saline (0.5\u2009M) colored with Evans blue dye and inserted into the central parts of the spheroid with the help of a stereomicroscope (Wild M5, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). PIF in the cell culture medium directly outside the spheroid was defined as the zero reference pressure.Electron microscopy of collagen fibrils in the tumorTumor samples were taken from the tumor periphery and were fixed and processed as previously described. A JEM-1230 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the diameter and organization of the collagen fibrils, and images from four to six different areas of the tissue were analyzed. Pictures were captured at \u00d7\u2009100,000 magnification and analyzed using Image J 1.46 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., USA) to measure the fibril diameter. To investigate the organization of the collagen fibrils, pictures were captured at \u00d7\u200930,000 magnification and scored from one to four considering collagen fibril organization and alignment within the collagen fibers.A JSM-7400F Scanning Electron microscope (Jeol) was used to study the tumor collagen fibril scaffold architecture. Five images from different areas of the tumor were captured from each tumor at \u00d7\u200910,000 magnification.Immunostaining and Picrosirius-red stainingHistological analysis was performed on both paraffin embedded sections and cryosections. For paraffin embedded sections, 5\u2009\u03bcm thick sections were deparaffinizated and rehydrated, followed by heat induced antigen retrieval at pH\u20096 (#S1699, Dako, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA., USA) for Ki67 (100\u2009\u00b0C, 20\u2009min) and \u03b1SMA (100\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009min), pH\u20099 (#2367, Dako) for Coll III (100\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009min) or pH\u200910 (#T6455, Sigma Aldrich) for PDGFR\u03b2 (110\u2009\u00b0C, 5\u2009min). After antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated with peroxidase block (#K006, Dako) and then primary antibody. Envision+ System-HRP (#K4006 or #K4010, Dako) was used as secondary antibody, in addition to rabbit anti-goat for collagen III (1:1000, #6164\u201301, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL., USA), and DAB was used as chromogen, except for \u03b1SMA staining, where a FITC-conjugated antibody was used. Analysis of immunohistochemistry was performed using Leica DN 2000 Led (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The following primary antibodies were used on paraffin sections: rabbit anti-mouse PDGFR\u03b2 mAb (1:100, #3169, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA., USA), goat anti-mouse Type III Collagen pAb (1:100, #1330\u201308, Southern Biotech), anti-mouse \u03b1SMA mAb (F3777, dilution 1:200, Sigma Aldrich) and mouse anti-human Ki67 mAb (1:100, #M7240, Dako).Cryosections with a thickness of 6\u2009\u03bcm were fixed in ice-cold methanol (\u2212\u200920\u2009\u00b0C, 8\u2009min) and rehydrated with PBS, followed by blocking with 10% goat serum. Afterwards, the following primary antibodies were supplied: rabbit anti-mouse integrin \u03b111 pAb (1:200, custom-made, Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden,), mouse anti-human cytokerain AE1/AE3 mAb (1:200, #M3515, Dako) and mouse anti \u03b1SMA mAb (1:200, #A5228, Sigma Aldrich). Goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (1:400, #111\u2013585-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ink., West Grove, PA., USA) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:400, #315\u2013545-045, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies. Mounting was done with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (#P36934, ThermoFisher). The staining results were evaluated under an Axioscope fluorescence microscope and micrographs were acquired using a digital AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Picrosirius-red stain (Polysciences inc, Warrington, FL., USA) was used for a semi-quantitative measurement of collagen type I and III as previously described.Evaluation of the stainingFor Picrosirius-red, collagen III, PDGFR\u03b2 and \u03b1SMA, a total of four to six pictures were captured from each tumor with \u00d7\u2009100 magnification. Images were taken in the tumor periphery in order to avoid the necrotic central area. The software Image J 1.46 (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD., USA) was used to identify the amount of positive pixels.For Ki67, the tumors were examined using light microscopy with an eye-piece grid at \u00d7\u2009630 magnification. A total of 500 tumor cells from the tumor periphery were evaluated, and distinct nuclear staining regardless of intensity was registered as positive. Areas with necrosis, bleeding or inflammation were avoided.MicrodialysisMicrodialysis was performed as previously described on the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors. Briefly, after anesthesia with Ketalar (Pfizer Inc., NY., USA) and Dormitor (Orin Pharma AS, Espoo, Finland), one microdialysis probe was placed in the MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumor (CMA12 Elite Microdialysis probe, ref.nr 8,010,434) and one in the jugular vein (CMA12 Elite Metal free, ref.nr 80,111,204). The probes were connected to a PE-50 catheter, perfused by a pump (CMA100 Microinjection pump, ref.nr 8,210,040) at a rate of 1\u2009\u03bcl/min and left to stabilize for 30\u2009min. After intravenous injection of 0.15\u2009ml 0.65\u2009MBq 3H-5FU (Nycomed Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), dialysate was sampled and pooled every 10\u2009min for a total of 90\u2009min. Scintillation counting solution (Optiphase Hisafe 3, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA., USA) was added, and the radioactivity measured using a liquid scintillation analyzer (Tri-Carb 2900TR, PerkinElmer, Inc.). The probes and pump were delivered by CMA Microdialysis AB, Kista, Sweden.The area under the curve (AUC) for the plasma and tumor was calculated with Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA., USA) as the total radioactivity collected, i.e. as the product of radioactivity (counts per minute) and time. Finally, transport of 3H-5FU was expressed as AUC tumor divided by AUC plasma.After each experiment, the probes were tested in saline with a known amount of 3H-5FU, and experiments with probes that differed more than 15% in permeability were excluded.HeterospheroidsHeterospheroids containing a mixture of SV40-immortalized MEFs and MDA-MB-231 cells were prepared using the hanging drop method as described previously. Briefly, sub-confluent cells were trypsinized and suspended in culture medium to a concentration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106/ml. The MEFs (WT or integrin \u03b111-KO MEFs) and MDA-MB-231 cell suspensions were then mixed at a ratio of 4:1 to make WT MEFs + MDA-MB-231 and \u03b111-KO MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids. Approximately 40 drops (25\u2009\u03bcl/ drop, 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/drop) were dispensed onto a lid of a cell culture dish. The lid was then inverted and placed over a cell culture dish containing medium for humidity, and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 5\u2009days.Statistical analysisSigmaplot 13.0 (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL., USA) and Graph Pad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software) were used for statistical analysis. Either the unpaired two-tailed t-test or the Mann- Whitney U test, was used to analyze statistical differences between the two groups. Results were accepted as statistically different when p\u2009<\u20090.05. Data are given as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, and number of measurements (n) refers to number of tumors or heterospheroids unless otherwise specified.ResultsEffect of stromal integrin \u03b111\u03b21 on breast tumor growthTumor growth. The growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (a-c) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice. A total of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 and 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 MDA-MB-468 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad, and for MDA-MB-231, also subcutaneously (s.c.) on the back. All MDA-MB-231 injected mice were sacrificed at day 57 post injection. The MDA-MB-468 injected mice were sacrificed at different time points starting with n\u2009=\u200920 WT and n\u2009=\u200916 \u03b111-KO. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM. ** p\u2009<\u20090.01. Immunofluorescence staining of integrin \u03b111 (red), cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (green) and DAPI (blue) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors (d) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice. Scale bars indicate 50\u2009\u03bcmMDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 tumor cells were injected into WT and \u03b111-KO mice. As expected, we found that integrin \u03b111 was expressed in the tumor stroma in WT mice, but not in \u03b111-KO mice (Fig.\u00a01d). Furthermore, the immunofluorescent staining of integrin \u03b111 (Fig. 1d) did not show differences in the amount of integrin \u03b111 expression between the MDA-MB-231 orthotropic and subcutaneous model (n\u2009=\u20093\u20135). The tumor volumes in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors were significantly reduced (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in \u03b111-KO mice compared to tumors grown in WT mice during their 57\u2009days growth period (Fig. 1a). A clear tendency towards reduced MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumor growth was also seen, but this did not reach statistical significance (p\u2009=\u20090.059) (Fig. 1b). Of note, there was no difference in MDA-MB-231 tumor growth when the cells were injected subcutaneously on the back (Fig. 1c).Tumor cell proliferation.

However, in the two other tumor models, there were no significant differences in number of proliferating tumor cells (Fig. 2b-d).Integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduces tumor interstitial fluid pressureTumor interstitial fluid pressure.

Reduced tumor PIF was seen in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT, but no difference was seen in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors. * p\u2009<\u20090.05The tumor PIF was measured by the wick-in-needle method. PIF was significantly reduced in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors grown in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT (Fig.\u00a03a-b). No difference in PIF was seen in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 3c).Integrin \u03b111-deficiency perturbs collagen structureCollagen amount. The total fraction of Picrosirius-red and collagen III positive staining quantified in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice showed no differences (n\u2009=\u20096 in both models). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Representative images of Picrosirius-red staining of sections from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (c).

Transmission electron microscopy pictures from the xenograft tumors were scored from 1 to 4 according to collagen organization. The average collagen organization score per tumor in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) were lower in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT (n\u2009=\u20098 WT and n\u2009=\u20097 \u03b111-KO mice in both models). No difference was found in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (c) (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. * p\u2009<\u20090.05, ** p\u2009<\u20090.01. Examples of the different scoring values from MDA-MB-468 tumors are shown in (d) (1- highly disorganized, 2-moderately disorganized, 3-moderately organized and 4-highly organized). Scale bars indicate 0.5\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril diameter. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze collagen fibrils. Collagen fibril diameter distribution and average fibril diameter per tumor in MDA-MB-231 (n\u2009=\u20097) (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (n\u2009=\u20097) (b) showed a shift towards thinner fibrils in \u03b111-KO mice compared to WT. No difference was seen in MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors (c) (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. * p\u2009<\u20090.05. Representative TEM images of collagen fibrils in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in both genotypes (d). Scale bars indicate 0.2\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril architecture. Representative scanning electron images of collagen fibrils in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (n\u2009=\u20095 WT and n\u2009=\u20094 \u03b111-KO in both models). Scale bar indicates 1\u2009\u03bcmCollagen fibril organization and structure in the xenograft tumors were investigated using TEM. As seen in Fig.\u00a05a-b and d, integrin \u03b111-deficiency lead to more disorganized collagen fibril architecture with fewer aligned collagen fibrils in both the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumor models. In these tumors, there was also a shift towards thinner collagen fibrils in \u03b111-KO compared to WT mice (Fig. 6a-b and d). No difference was seen in either collagen fibril alignment or collagen fibril diameter in the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumors when comparing \u03b111-KO mice with WT (Figs. 5c and 6c). In addition, SEM did not demonstrate visual differences in the collagen fibril structure between tumors grown in \u03b111-KO mice versus WT (Fig. 7).\u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2. The total fraction of \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2 positive staining quantified in MDA-MB-231 (a) and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors (b) in WT and \u03b111-KO mice showed no differences (n\u2009=\u20096 in both models). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Immunofluorescence staining of integrin \u03b111 (red), \u03b1SMA (green) and DAPI (blue) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 mammary fat pad tumors in WT and \u03b111-KO mice (c). Scale bars indicate 50\u2009\u03bcmImmunostaining of \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2, common markers of activated fibroblasts and pericytes, was used to quantify the relative amount of activated fibroblasts in the tumor stroma. Although integrin \u03b111 partially co-localized with \u03b1SMA in xenograft tumors in WT mice (Fig. 8c), no significant differences in the amount of PDGFR\u03b2 or \u03b1SMA expression (Fig. 8a-b and Additional file 1: Figure S1) in tumors in \u03b111-KO compared to WT mice were found.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 does not affect uptake of 3H-5FUMicrodialysis. Dialysate was sampled for 90\u2009min after i.v. injection of 3H-5FU, and the ratio between 3H-5FU level in plasma and in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumor was calculated as Area Under Curve (AUC). There was no significant difference in uptake when WT and \u03b111-KO mice were compared (n\u2009=\u20095). Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SDThe reduced tumor PIF found in MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad tumors in \u03b111-KO mice was not associated with increased uptake of 3H-5FU measured by microdialysis (Fig. 9).Pressure homeostasis and integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in heterospheroidsHeterospheroids. The individual interstitial fluid pressures (PIF) in heterospheroids containing a mixture of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells (4:1) (a). \u03b111-KO MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids showed a significant reduction in PIF compared to WT MEFs + MDA-MB-231 spheroids. *** p\u2009<\u20090.001. Transmission electron microscopy images show collagen fibrils in both heterospheroid types (b)Since the in vivo results demonstrate that stromal integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a role in maintaining pressure homeostasis in triple-negative breast xenograft tumors, we also investigated the isolated effect of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts on tumor PIF in a simplified system. Spheroids composed of fibroblasts lacking integrin \u03b111 grown together with MDA-MB-231 cells had significantly lower PIF compared to spheroids with MDA-MB-231 cells and WT fibroblasts (Fig. 10a-b). These data indicate that the difference in PIF is, at least in part, due to integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts.Tumor metastasesNo lung metastases were seen when investigating coronal HE stained sections from lungs at end stage.DiscussionIntegrins are essential adhesion receptors necessary for intercellular communication, attachment of cells to the ECM and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we have demonstrated that stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency markedly decreased PIF in vivo using two orthotopic human triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. A perturbed collagen structure was seen, with fewer aligned and thinner collagen fibrils. Furthermore, integrin \u03b111-deficiency impeded orthotopic breast tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 model, and the same trend was also found in the MDA-MB-468 orthotopic model. By investigating the isolated effect of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts on MDA-MB-231 tumor cells in vitro, we provide here evidence that PIF regulation is, at least partly, mediated by integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts.Integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has arisen as a possible marker of a pro-tumorigenic subset of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. It has been found to be overexpressed in the stroma of lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Further, it stimulates lung cancer cell growth in vitro, and lung and prostate cancer growth in vivo. However, its role in tumor growth and progression is still not clear, especially in breast tumors where we recently reported that it did not affect the growth of the murine TNBC cell line 4\u2009T1 in vivo.In the present study, we found that stromal integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to reduced tumor PIF in both orthotopic xenograft models. This demonstrates for the first time that integrin \u03b111\u03b21 has a role in maintaining an elevated PIF in solid tumors. A dense ECM, contractile fibroblasts, leaky blood vessels and dysfunctional lymphatic drainage are possible causes of increased PIF in tumors. PIF can be actively modulated through interactions between contractile fibroblasts and ECM molecules, where fibroblasts have been proposed to normally exert a tension on the collagen network through collagen-binding integrins. Furthermore, integrin \u03b111\u03b21 contracts collagen matrices experimentally, and we therefore suggest that integrin \u03b111\u03b21-mediated PIF modifications can involve a contraction of the interstitial space mediated by direct or indirect binding of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts to collagen.The involvement of integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts in tumor PIF homeostasis is supported by our study of heterospheroids, where we observed a similar PIF reduction in spheroids composed of MDA-MB-231 cells and integrin \u03b111-deficient fibroblasts. This simplified system allows us to investigate how fibroblasts grown together with tumor cells can influence PIF. In line with our results, a similar integrin \u03b111\u03b21 function in pressure regulation has previously been shown in fibroblasts/lung cancer heterospheroids. However, although these avascular spheroid studies indicate that the pressure regulatory abilities of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 is, at least in part, mediated by integrin \u03b111-positive fibroblasts, the mechanisms behind integrin \u03b111-mediated effect on PIF in heterospheroids are not investigated in detail in this study. In addition, we cannot exclude additional factors in the more complex in vivo system, such as influence of the tumor vasculature, which has been shown to have an important impact on tumor PIF.Furthermore, integrin \u03b111-deficiency led to less organized and thinner collagen fibrils in the orthotopic models, which could be a contributing factor to reduced tumor PIF. Although it has been shown that the collagen-binding proteoglycan fibromodulin promotes the formation of a dense stroma and increased tumor PIF, it is nevertheless difficult to predict how different components in the extracellular matrix affect the hydraulic conductivity of tissues and thereby fluid flow and PIF.Although the present study is the first to identify integrin \u03b111\u03b21 as participating in regulation of pressure in solid tumors, it is already known to maintain a homeostatic PIF in dermis. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated the function of \u03b21-integrins in the regulation of dermal PIF by inhibiting \u03b21-integrins.Numerous studies have highlighted the role of CAFs in tumor progression, invasion and metastasis, either directly by stimulation of tumor cells via production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors or indirectly by for example remodeling the ECM (reviewed in). Here we show that integrin \u03b111\u03b21, known to be expressed during myofibroblast differentiation, seems to facilitate breast tumor growth in vivo.In previous studies, the pro-tumorigenic abilities of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 have been associated with increased matrix stiffness, collagen reorganization and increased levels of IGF-2. In the present study, changes in pressure homeostasis and collagen organization could both influence tumor growth and invasion. Of interest, increased tumor PIF has been linked to tumor aggressiveness in some human cancers, and is an independent poor prognostic factor in cervical cancer.There have been reports suggesting that increased tumor PIF can both facilitate and inhibit tumor progression. First, major pressure gradients due to increased tumor PIF can enhance interstitial fluid flow at and lymph drainage from the tumor margins, which probably increase the risk of cancer cells leaving the tumor. Increased flow can also facilitate tumor progression indirectly by either mechano-modulation of the tumor stroma or by changing the host immune response and thereby promote immunological tolerance (reviewed in). Further, in vitro elevation of tumor PIF increased proliferation of human osteosarcoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Similarly, in vivo lowering of tumor PIF, and thereby reduction of mechanical stretch for 24\u2009h, reduced tumor cell proliferation in vulva and lung xenograft tumors. However, contrary to these findings, increased tumor PIF may also limit uptake of nutrition and growth factors into the tumor and thereby inhibit tumor cell progression. In the context of breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 cells have actually been shown to invade towards regions of higher pressure in vitro, indicating that the elevated tumor PIF may in fact restrain breast tumor invasion. In summary, these findings demonstrate that maintenance of a high tumor PIF may be a contributing factor to integrin \u03b111\u03b21\u2019s pro-tumorigenic effects, but at the same time, it can have opposite effects during tumorigenesis, pinpointing the need for further preclinical investigation.Although increased tumor PIF can be a major barrier in cancer treatment, lowering of tumor PIF by integrin \u03b111-deficiency did not increase the uptake of the low molecular weight drug 3H-5FU into MDA-MB-231 tumor interstitium. Low molecular weight compounds are transported by both diffusion and bulk flow/convection, and we have previously shown that reducing PIF can increase the uptake of the small molecular weight drugs 3H-5FU and 51Cr-EDTA into the tumor interstitium. However, in parallel with the results in the present study, it is evident that lowering of PIF will not always increase the uptake of low molecular weight drugs. Similarily, Flessner et al. showed that decapsulation of ovarian xenografts markedly decreased PIF to zero, but did not increase penetration of the high molecular weight drug trastuzumab into the tumor. In summary, probably other features of the tumor microenvironment can also contribute to the failure of transport within solid tumors.Our data show that integrin \u03b111-deficiency leads to thinner and less organized collagen fibrils in the orthotopic tumor stroma. Changes in collagen composition and organization are already known to influence tumorigenesis and can predict breast cancer behavior. For example, progressive deposition of collagen and increased collagen fiber linearization are associated with breast cancer aggressiveness.While integrin \u03b111-deficiency influenced tumor growth and reduced PIF with concomitantly more disorganized collagen fibrils in the orthotopic tumors, no effect was seen in the MDA-MB-231 ectopic tumors. Interestingly, there was similar amount of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 expression in both the MDA-MB-231 models. In a previous study, we also observed that while integrin \u03b111-deficiency reduced RM11 tumor growth, but did not affect 4\u2009T1 tumor growth, the integrin \u03b111\u03b21 expression was not higher in RM11 than in 4\u2009T1 tumors. Thus, differences in integrin \u03b111\u03b21-expression cannot explain the contrasting effect seen in these in vivo models.The different effects seen between the MDA-MB-231 orthotopic and ectopic tumors show that tumor location significantly influences the effect of integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in vivo. The tumor microenvironment displays a significant heterogeneity, and the subcutaneous location probably does not always give rise to a representative tissue-specific stromal infiltration. Supporting the fact that the organ-specific fibroblasts influence breast tumor growth differently, co-injection of breast fibroblast with breast tumor cells increased tumor growth, whereas no enhancement was seen with the co-injection of skin fibroblasts. The significance of the local microenvironment illustrates the complexity of in vivo studies, and may explain some of the discrepancies seen with different mouse models. This underlines the importance of choosing the appropriate preclinical model, particularly when investigating the tumor microenvironment. If possible, orthotopic models should be preferred rather than ectopic ones.ConclusionOur findings indicate an important role for integrin \u03b111\u03b21 in interstitial fluid pressure regulation in the breast tumor microenvironment. Further, since integrin \u03b111\u03b21 seems to impede breast cancer growth, it may be an interesting candidate for stromal targeted therapy.Additional fileAbbreviations3H-5FU3H-5-Fluorouracil5FU5-FluorouracilAUCArea under the curveCAFSCancer associated fibroblastsDAB3,3\u2032-DiaminobenzidineECMExtracellular matrixHEHematoxylin and eosinHER-2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IGF-2Insulin-like growth factor 2MABMonoclonal antibodyMBqMegabecquerelMEFsMouse embryonic fibroblastsPABPolyclonal antibodyPBSPhosphate buffered salinePDGFR\u03b2Platelet-derived growth factor receptor betaPIFInterstitial fluid pressureS.C.SubcutaneousSCIDSevere combined immunodeficiencySEMScanning electron microscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerWTWild type\u03b111-KOIntegrin \u03b111-deficient\u03b1SMAAlpha-smooth muscle actinAuthors\u2019 contributionsConceived and designed the experiments: HYHS LS RKR.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant cell type within cancer stroma, play significant roles in overall breast cancer development and spread. Genetic and epigenetic changes activate stromal fibroblasts, which then escort cancer cells throughout the whole carcinogenic process in a paracrine manner. Indeed, activated fibroblasts secrete high levels of various growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases such as the MMPs, which are used to communicate with cancer cells as well as with other stromal cells. CAFs exhibit some important features of neoplastic cells and have been shown to promote carcinogenesis both in vitro and in animal models. High numbers of active stromal fibroblasts are often associated with high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis. Furthermore, CAFs were shown to play major roles in drug resistance and tumour recurrence.Surgery is considered the first line of treatment for most breast tumours. During lumpectomy, the tumour is removed with some normal surrounding tissues (surgical margins) to ensure the removal of all tumour cells and to minimize local recurrence. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that surgical margin status influences the risk of local recurrence. Recurrences arise most frequently in the tumour bed. Thereby, radiotherapy is usually applied as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of relapse. Furthermore, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) was also used and yielded very low recurrence rates when given as a boost. Importantly, TARGIT impaired the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding. This may be due to the immediate effect of radiation on the local tumour microenvironment, making it less favourable for tumour growth and progression. This suggests that cancer may recur following breast conserving surgery due to residual unresected tumour or to the presence of active stromal cells, or both. In fact, even in tumour-free tissues, the microenvironment could still play a capital role in tumour development/recurrence. Indeed, it has been recently shown that breast cancers with higher mean stiffness values at shear-wave elastography, which is related to the surrounding stroma rather than to the cancer itself, had poorer prognostic features. Therefore, we sought to undergo molecular and cellular characterization of breast stromal fibroblasts from negative surgical margins. We show that these cells exhibit a specific gene expression profile and are procarcinogenic.Materials and methodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblasts were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients under Research Ethical Committee Project No. RAC#2031091. CAFs were derived from tumour areas of the samples, while TCFs were developed from histologically normal tissues located at least 2 cm away from tumours (invasive ductal carcinomas). Processing of tissues was performed after routine examination by a certified anatomical pathologist, using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Normal fibroblasts (NBFs) and epithelial cells (NLECs) were derived from healthy age-matched females who underwent breast reduction surgery. In the present experiments, NBFs, CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, under the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). NLEC cells were cultured in universal medium [1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10\u20138 m choleratoxin, 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium), 0.4 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone, 2 \u00d7 10\u20139 m T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and 5 mg/ml oestrogen, and were used at passage 2. MCF-7 and MCF-10 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), except for antibiotic/antimycotics and ITS, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cells cultured in medium with serum, whilst serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was obtained from cells cultured in the absence of serum. In both cases, the cells were cultured for 24 h before the media were collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.Affymetrix exon array and data analysis; quantitative RT\u2013PCRExon array protocols are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. Quantitative RT\u2013PCR was conducted as described previously. All reactions were performed in triplicate and the data analysed using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. The respective primers are presented in Supplementary materials and methods.Cell proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with SFCM and incubated for different time intervals (0, 24 and 48 h). Cell proliferation was measured by the tetrazolium salt colorimetric assay, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) after incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The amount of formazan was quantified at 450 nm.Immunoblotting, cytokine array and ELISAImmunoblotting of total cell protein lysates was performed as previously described. Antibodies are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. SFCMs from CAF, TCF and NBF cells were applied to a RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody array (RayBiotech Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems; or RayBiotech for MMP-2). These experiments were performed in triplicate.Chemotaxis and invasion assayInvasion chambers (24-well) were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines (BD Bioscience); 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells were added to the upper wells, separated by an 8 \u00b5m pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with Diff Quick (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane, using Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using a light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification \u00d740). Each assay was performed in triplicate.Orthotopic tumour xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH & RC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Fifteen female nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper, using the formula: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsSurgical margin stromal fibroblasts exhibit a specific gene expression profileTo identify the molecular changes that can take place in breast stromal fibroblasts from surgical margins, gene expression profiles of five paired CAFs/TCFs as well as three NBFs were examined. Total RNA was extracted and genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed, using Affymetrix's GeneChip\u00ae Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (HE 1.0 STAs). Three different comparisons were performed: TCFs with CAFs; TCFs with NBFs; and CAFs with NBFs. p < 0.05 and a threshold of absolute fold change \u2264 2 \u2265 was considered a significant difference in the analysis of the microarray data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed 804 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TCF, CAF and NBF cells. The unsupervised two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical clustering revealed a clear pattern of gene expression, defining three main transcriptome clusters corresponding to TCFs, CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A).Differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Total RNA from five CAFs, their corresponding TCFs as well as three NBFs was used to perform genome-wide gene expression analysis. (A) Unsupervised 2D hierarchical clustering of significantly varying genes across the three groups was performed using Pearson's correlation with average linkage clustering (only the top 112 of the most significantly dysregulated genes are shown for readability). (B) The three dominant PCA components that contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix clearly distinguished samples as CAF, TCF and NBF. (C) Venn diagram showing differential gene expression between the groups. (D) qRT\u2013PCR data for the indicated genes (mean \u00b1 SD)Unsupervised principle components analysis (PCA), which contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix, further showed the presence of three distinct groups (Figure 1B). Intriguingly, the TCF samples clustered closer to CAF cells than to NBFs. Moreover, the gene expression variability was highest for the TCF group (Figure 1B). Next, Venn diagram analysis was performed, with the significance of overlaps calculated using hypergeometric distributional assumption and p values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This comparison approach revealed a significant overlap between TCFs and CAFs as compared to the two other comparisons (p < 10\u20135) (Figure 1C). Indeed, among the three comparisons, the least number of DEGs was between CAFs versus TCFs, with only 42 DEGs (Figure 1C). On the other hand, the number of DEGs between CAFs and NBFs reached 101 (Figure 1C). Comparing TCF with NBF, we found 77 DEGs, 25 of which were also differentially expressed between CAFs and NBFs, while the levels of 49 genes were uniquely dysregulated in TCFs as compared to NBFs and CAFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that TCF cells present in surgical margins exhibit specific gene expression patterns relative to their corresponding CAFs and also normal breast fibroblasts.Quantitative RT\u2013PCR validation of gene expression resultsTo validate the RNA microarray analysis, we performed quantitative RT\u2013PCR on nine genes: MMP-3, ITGB8, SFRP4, ITGBP7, ADAMTS1, CTGF, PTGS, SDHC and CCL-2. Figure 1D shows differential expression of all these genes between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. These results confirm the presence of differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokinesNext, we assessed the level of secreted pro-carcinogenic cytokines from CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Therefore, CAF-114, TCF-114 and NBF-6 were cultured to 80% confluency and then complete medium (CpM) was replaced with serum-free medium (SFM). Serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was collected after 48 h of incubation and applied to the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody array map. The array showed differential levels of various cytokines between TCF, CAF and NBF cells (Figure 2A). Upon quantification and normalization against the positive controls probed on the membrane, it was clear that CAFs secreted the highest levels of the majority of these cytokines (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the levels of SDF-1, CCL-25, TIMP-1 and TNF-alfa were also higher in TCF-114 cells than in NBF cells (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained when comparing CAF-180, TCF-180 and NBF-1 (data not shown). This shows that TCFs, although present in histologically normal parts of the breast, secrete high levels of various pro-carcinogenic cytokines.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokines. SFCMs from the indicated cells were collected and applied on the human cytokine antibody array map. (A) Cytokine array maps highlighting the differentially expressed cytokines. (B) Quantification of the array data for selected cytokines. (C) SFCMs were used to assess the levels of the indicated proteins by ELISA in CAF/TCF pairs from three patients compared to NBF-6 (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005)TCFs secrete high levels of SDF-1, VEGF-A and IL-6To further show the variation in cytokine secretion, SFCMs were collected from three different CAFs and their corresponding TCFs (87, 180 and 142) and NBF-6, and were used to assess the levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A by ELISA. Figure 2C shows that CAF cells secreted the highest levels of the three cytokines. Interestingly, the secreted levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A were also higher in all TCFs compared to NBF-6 (8.2-, 4.2- and 25-fold higher, respectively) (Figure 2C). Figure 2C also shows inter-patient variation in the secreted levels of these important pro-carcinogenic factors. These results confirm that TCF cells secrete higher levels of pro-carcinogenic factors relative to normal breast fibroblasts.TCF cells from surgical margins exhibit features of active fibroblastsTo test whether fibroblasts from surgical margins display features of activation, we examined the levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 (two major markers of active breast fibroblasts) by immunoblotting. Interestingly, like CAF cells, TCFs also express higher levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 than NBF-6 and NBF-1 (Figure 3A). However, while the level of \u03b1-SMA was similar in TCFs and their corresponding CAFs, SDF-1 levels were slightly higher in CAF cells as compared to their respective TCFs (Figure 3A). Next, we studied the migratory and invasiveness abilities of TCF cells, using chambers either coated with Matrigel (invasion) or uncoated (migration). While CpM was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers, cells (4 \u00d7 105) were added to the upper wells in serum-free medium for 24 h. Figure 3B shows that while NBF-1 and NBF-6 cells were unable to migrate, TCF-87 and TCF-180 cells showed invasiveness and migratory abilities. However, the number of invading and migrating TCF cells was lower than that of their corresponding CAF cells (Figure 3B). This provides further evidence that TCF cells display active fibroblast features.TCFs are active fibroblasts. (A) Immunoblotting for \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 of the indicated cell lysates. (B) Invasion/migration assays. The numbers of invaded/migrated cells are presented in the histogram (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005 for TCFs compared to NBF-1 and NBF-6; note that CAFs are also significantly different)Surgical margin fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of non-cancerous epithelial cellsTo further show the active state of TCF cells, we studied their paracrine effect on the proliferation of epithelial cells. SFCMs collected from CAF/TCF-142, -180, -87 and \u2212114 pairs and from NBF-6 and NBF-1 were used for culturing non-cancerous MCF10A epithelial cells. Proliferation of MCF10A cells was higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF and TCF cells, compared to NBF cells. TCFs showed an intermediate effect between CAFs and NBFs (Figure 4). Indeed, after 24 h of incubation, SFCMs from TCF-87 and CAF-87 enhanced cell proliferation two- and four-fold, respectively, compared to SFCM from NBF cells (Figure 4). Similar results were obtained with CAF/TCF-180 and \u2212142 pairs (Figure 4). For CAF/TCF-114, both enhanced the proliferation of MCF10A by four-fold at 24 h of incubation (Figure 4). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs also enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner.TCF-conditioned medium enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. MCF10A cells were cultured in SFCMs from the indicated fibroblasts from four patients and proliferation measured at the indicated times using the WST-1 assay, compared to SFCMs from the two NBF cultures performed at the same time. Error bars represent \u00b1 SDTCFs promote migration/invasion and induce mesenchymal features of breast cancer cellsWe next investigated the effect of TCF cells on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. SFCMs collected from TCF-180, CAF-180 and NBF-6 were added to MCF-7 cells (105) that had previously been seeded in the upper compartments of migration/invasion plates. Figure 5A shows that the number of migrated MCF-7 cells was much higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF-180 and TCF-180 than with NBF-6 cells or SFM (used as negative control). Figure 5A shows that SFCMs from both CAF-180 and TCF-180 enhanced about 73-fold the migration ability of these breast cancer cells as compared to NBF-6.TCF cells enhance the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells and promote EMT. (A) SCFMs from the indicated cells were added into the lower compartments of 24-well BD BioCoat plates. MCF-7 cells (105) were seeded onto the upper compartment of the plates and incubated for 24 h. The numbers of invaded and migrated cells are presented (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005). (B, C) MCF-7 or normal luminal epithelial cells (NLEC) were treated with the indicated SFCMs for 24 h and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodiesNext, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism/pathway that underlies TCF-dependent increase in the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we explored the paracrine effect of TCF cells on the phosphorylation/activation of Akt, a known pro-invasive protein kinase. Epithelial MCF-7 cells were treated with SFM or SFCM from TCF-180 and CAF-180 for 24 h. Figure 5B shows that SFCMs from TCF and CAF cells increased the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt, with no effect on the level of total protein. Since active Akt and the increase in the invasiveness/migratory abilities of breast cancer cells accompany the transition of these epithelial cells to the mesenchymal phenotype, we assessed the level of N-cadherin and Snail and showed that SFCM from TCF cells increased the level of these two important markers of mesenchymal cells (Figure 5B). On the other hand, the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were markedly reduced (Figure 5B). These results indicate that, like CAFs, TCF cells have the ability to trigger the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process.TCF cells activate Akt and up-regulate PCNA and MMP-2 in normal luminal cells in a paracrine mannerSince TCFs are present in histologically normal parts of the breast, we sought to investigate their effect on primary normal luminal epithelial cells (NLECs). Therefore, NLECs were incubated for 24 h with SFCMs from TCF, CAF and NBF, and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting. Figure 5C shows increase in the level of the proliferation marker PCNA in luminal cells pretreated with SFCMs from CAF and TCF cells, with a higher effect of CAF cells (Figure 5C). Similarly, the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt and also MMP-2 increased under the paracrine effect of TCF and CAF cells (Figure 5C). This shows that, like CAF cells, TCFs have the ability to promote tumourigenesis in normal luminal epithelial cells.TCFs stimulate breast cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse modelTo investigate the effect of fibroblasts on tumour growth in vivo, 15 nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer tumours were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. All mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and CAF-180 cells developed tumours. On the other hand, while two of five mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and TCF-180 cells had tumours, only one mouse co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and NBF-6 cells developed a tumour (Figure 6A). Importantly, this tumour appeared 29 days post-injection, while tumours containing TCF and CAF cells appeared only 15 days after implantation (Figure 6B). Furthermore, at 40 days post-injection, while the size of the tumour containing NBF-6 cells reached a volume of 1.4 cm3, the tumours containing TCF and CAF cells reached 4 cm3 and 7 cm3 on average, respectively (Figure 6A, B). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs have the ability to promote tumour formation and growth compared to normal fibroblasts.TCFs enhance the formation and the growth of human breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice. Breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells under the nipples of nude mice. (A) Tumour size 40 days post-injection. (B) Time-dependent tumour growth (mean \u00b1 SD)DiscussionWe have shown here that breast stromal fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins exhibit a specific gene expression pattern compared to cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal breast fibroblasts, with 77 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and NBFs and 42 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and their paired CAFs. Intriguingly, the expression pattern of 49 genes was specific for TCF cells, as compared to CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues around tumours may also be affected by the presence of tumour cells. Notably, the genes that were found differentially expressed uniquely in TCFs were enriched with biological processes and functions related to, among others, inflammatory response, response to stimulus, immune cell trafficking, tissue development and cell signalling (see Supplementary material, Figure S1A, Table S2). To elucidate how these deregulated genes are interacting with genes in various metabolic pathways, the DEGs were mapped to gene networks using the ingenuity knowledge base. The network analysis revealed the potentially important role of CCL13, CTGF, CYP1B1, IGFBP7 and B4GALT1 (see Supplementary material, Figure S1B). Interestingly, genes deregulated in TCF cells interact, directly or indirectly, with the UBC gene (see Supplementary material, Figure S1C), which plays an essential role in maintaining ubiquitin levels, especially under stress conditions. Indeed, this polyubiquitin gene is up-regulated by cellular stresses and contains classical heat-shock elements in its promoter, suggesting that stress-related factors are involved in the TCF-specific gene expression profile and may relate to evidence that cancer cells use oxidative stress to activate adjacent fibroblasts. Comparing the variation in gene expression in each cell type showed variability within the three categories of cells. Interestingly, the gene expression profiles of TCF cells were more heterogeneous than those of CAF and NBF cells (Figure 1C), indicating higher patient-to-patient variability in stromal fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues.Differential gene expression between CAF and TCF cells from breast tumours has been reported previously. Bauer et al found 37 genes differentially expressed between six paired TCFs and CAFs and have also shown higher gene expression variability in TCF than in CAF cells. In another study, 420 genes were found to be differentially expressed between CAFs and normal breast fibroblasts from mammoplasties (NBFs). Similarly, we have shown here that the expression of 101 genes varied between CAF and NBF cells. However, the current study presents the first micro-array comparative analysis between surgical margin fibroblasts, their corresponding CAFs and NBFs. In addition, we have shown that fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins have higher migratory/invasiveness abilities than normal breast fibroblasts. Furthermore, these cells enhanced the proliferation rate of non-carcinogenic epithelial cells and the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as the formation/growth of breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice (Figures 5, 6). Interestingly, like CAFs, TCFs induced features of mesenchymal cells in breast cancer cells. Moreover, TCFs up-regulated PCNA and MMP2 and activated Akt in normal breast luminal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. This indicates that these cells have the ability to promote cancer development and progression. This effect could be mediated through secretion of cytokines and/or energy transfer mechanisms (reverse Warburg effect).Notably, the magnitude of all these TCF-related effects was intermediate between those of CAFs and NBFs. This shows that, despite their localization in histologically normal breast tissues and not being in direct contact with cancer cells, TCFs acquired some myofibroblast features, suggesting that cancer cells can affect not only cancer-associated fibroblasts but also fibroblasts present in cancer-free adjacent tissues. This effect could be mediated through secreted molecules able to diffuse from cancer cells through normal tissue, reaching distant cells. TGF\u03b2 could play an important role in this effect. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 can induce the production of \u03b1-SMA in mammary fibroblasts in vitro and consequently transdifferentiates fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. It is also possible that cancer cells activate adjacent fibroblasts through the aerobic glycolysis process (Warburg effect), which produces pyruvate and lactate. Indeed, treatment with lactate transport inhibitor prevented the conversion of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts.Our data indicate that remaining active fibroblasts following resection may enhance the chances of tumour recurrence, since these cells may constitute a fertile soil for tumour growth. To date, the most appropriate amount of normal breast tissue that should be removed to minimize local recurrence remains controversial. However, it is well known that local recurrence in patients submitted to conservative surgery is more common than in patients treated by mastectomy, showing the importance of surgical margins status for local relapse. Furthermore, several publications have reported the importance of the pathological margin status in determining the risk of local recurrence after breast conserving therapy. In conclusion, the present data show that breast stromal fibroblasts localized in cancer-free surgical margins are active and hence can potentiate the carcinogenesis process, and indicate that the tumour microenvironment may play determinant roles in local recurrence. Therefore, in the era of personalized therapy, the status of tumour stroma should also be taken into consideration for more efficient treatment and the prevention of recurrence as well as metastasis.Author contributionsMAA, S-FH and AAl performed experiments and analysed the data; FA performed experiments on the mice; DC and NK performed the micro-array data analysis; OA provided the tissues; AA supervised the work and analysed the data; and DC and AA wrote the paper.

In this study, we assessed the effect of media conditioned by MRC-5 fibroblasts or MCF-7/6 breast cancer cells on cathepsin D (CD) production and secretion by these two cell types. We also considered the influence of estrogens and matrix components (type I or type IV collagen, or Matrigel) on the expression and activity of CD produced by breast cancer cells of different invasive potentials (MCF-7/AZ, MCF-7/6, MDA-MB-231). In our system, fibroblasts conditioned medium does not significantly affect CD levels produced and secreted by the MCF-7/6 cells. However, we found that fibroblasts are able to capture the pro-CD secreted by these tumor cells by a mannose 6-phosphate-dependent process. We also found a positive correlation between the proportion of extracellular CD levels and the invasive potentials of the tumor cell types considered. If estrogens are able to upregulate CD production and secretion by receptor-positive cells, it is not the case of extracellular matrix components. On the other hand, our results indicate that matrix components are able to influence the distribution of the different CD forms in and out of the cells. Our data suggest that tumor fibroblasts, by enhancing their intracellular CD levels, could assist cancer cells in the digestion of extracellular matrix during the invasion of tissues.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

P values are reported as: ns, nonsignificant; *, P <\u00a0.05; **, P <\u00a0.01; ***, P <\u00a0.001; ****, P <\u00a0.0001.Continued.Continued.The relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC was estimated by expression profile clustering using classic CAF markers reported in previous studies, including ACTA2, FAP, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PDPN, THY1 and COL1A1. The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Significantly positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue lines, respectively. The color and size of the nodes indicate the type of cells and P values from Cox regression. Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.

Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

During this process, intercellular communication is critical, especially between tumor cells and the surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), to create a tumor-favoring niche that allows tumor growth and colonization. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts that constitute the major components of TME and play crucial roles in tumor development and metastasis . In human breast cancer, increased CAFs has been shown to associate with aggressive disease, recurrence and drug resistance . However, the role and mechanisms of CAF contribution to breast cancer metastasis is still poorly understood. It remains as a significant challenge to elucidate intracellular signaling pathways in CAFs that regulate intercellular communication between CAF and tumor cells critical for different stages of cancer metastasis.Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles generated in multi-vesicular bodies and released from different cells . They range from 50\u2013150 nm in size and contain bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, including microRNAs (miRNA). Previous studies showed that cancer cells secrete exosomes to regulate recipient cell functions in TME to facilitate cancer metastasis and progression . Exosomal miRNAs derived from cancer cells contribute to increased tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by affecting both local TME and distal organs via circulation . A recent study suggested that CAF-derived exosomes can promote stemness properties, EMT phenotype, and anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells . However, in contrast to extensive studies of exosomes and miRNAs from cancer cells, less is known about the functions of CAF-derived exosomes through delivering miRNA contents to recipient cancer cells to promote cancer metastasis.Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates signal transduction by integrins and other cell surface receptors to regulate cell adhesion, migration, survival, proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cells . FAK overexpression in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis. Previous studies have strongly implicated FAK in the development and progression of breast and other cancers . Several groups, including us, have shown that deletion of FAK in mammary epithelial cells suppresses tumor formation and progression in mouse models of breast cancer . We and others have also shown that FAK signaling play important roles in endothelial cells to promote embryonic and cancer angiogenesis and drug resistance . However, in contrast to the wealth of knowledge on FAK in tumor cells, much less is known about its potential role in tumor stroma, other than a role for endothelial FAK in tumor angiogenesis.In this study, we generated and analyzed fibroblast-specific inducible FAK knockout mice in a breast cancer model to investigate the potential role and mechanisms of FAK in CAF to promote breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Our studies showed that FAK ablation in fibroblasts significantly reduced breast cancer metastasis by impairing the abilities of CAF-derived exosomes to promote cancer cell migration and other activities at least in part due to altered exosomal miR-148a and miR-16. These results provide significant insights into the multiple mechanisms of FAK signaling in TME besides their essential role in mammary tumor cells, which may contribute to the future development of novel therapies for breast cancer targeting FAK.Materials and MethodsTumor miceMMTV-PyMT;FAKf/f mice have been described previously , and Col1a2-creERT mice obtained from Jackson Lab. The tumor cohorts were maintained on a FVB/N genetic background after extensive back-crossing (7x or more). Mice were housed and handled according to local, state, and federal regulations, and all experimental procedures were carried out as per the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Cincinnati. Tumors were measured by calipers and volume was calculated as (\u00bd)(length)(width). To induce deletion, mice were treated with 2mg tamoxifen for three times every other day, intra-peritoneally.Cell culture and treatmentMDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and WI-38 cells were obtained from ATCC. These cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. Murine fibroblasts were prepared from primary tumors and lung tissues, as described previously . Isolated fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, insulin (10ng/ml) and EGF (10ng/ml). Wound healing, trans-well invasion and sphere-forming assays were carried out as described previously . For trans-well assays, 10% serum media was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber while tumor cells were seeded in the upper chamber with 0.1% FBS and tumor cells were assayed for 16 hours. For co-culture trans-well assays (Figures 2C-D), tumor conditioned media pre-educated WI-38 cells were seeded in the lower chamber with respective tumor conditioned media before plating tumor cells in the upper chambers 2 hours later. For conditioned media, cells were cultured in 10% serum media and media was collected after 72 hours. For treatment with miRNA inhibitors (synthesized from IDT), cells were treated at the indicated concentrations for 48 hours prior to starting an assay.EDU incorporation assayCells were cultured with 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) treatment (100 nM) for 4 hrs. The formalin-fixed cells were stained with Tris (100 mM), CuSO4 (1 mM), fluorescent-488 azide (100 \u03bcM), ascorbic acid (50 mM) and DAPI (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 10 min. Three independent field of views for stained cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy and counted for statistical analysis.AntibodiesAntibodies used in this study were Integrin \u03b24 (Thermo Fisher, MA180984), Pan-cytokeratin (Cell Signaling, 4545), Cyclin E (Santa Cruz, sc-481), beta-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A5441), FAK (Santa Cruz, sc558), pY397-FAK (Abcam, 39967), SMA (Abcam, 7817), CD63 (System Biosciences, EXOAB-CD63A-1), CD81 (Cell Signaling, 10037), ALIX (Cell Signaling, 2171) and GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 2118).Histology and immunohistochemistryFor histological analysis of tissues, samples were fixed overnight in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, dehydrated in alcohol gradients, xylene and paraffin before being embedded. Then, they were sectioned (5-\u03bcm) and subjected to immuno-histochemistry as previously described .ImmunoblottingCell lysates were prepared with modified radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer as described previously  with the addition of Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific, 78425; 78428). Protein concentrations were quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method, subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously .Exosome isolation and characterizationExosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation as described previously . Exosome size were determined using Nanosight and purity by CD63 flow cytometry. Scanning electron microscopy was used to validate the size distribution of exosomes.Quantitative PCRTotal RNA was isolated from cells using an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, 74004) per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. miRNAs were prepared from isolated exosomes using mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Equal amounts of RNA were then reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen, 18080\u2013044) using random hexamers as primers. cDNA samples were then subjected to qRT-PCR analysis with SYBR Green (BioRad, 1725121) in a BioRad CFXConnect (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) thermo-cycler. For miRNA analysis, snRNA RNU6B was used to normalize expression levels. List of primers used are available upon request.miRNA sequencing analysisMiRNA sequencing was performed at the Genomics, Epigenomics and Sequencing Core in University of Cincinnati. Briefly, NEBNext small RNA sample library preparation kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA) was used to prepare the library for sequencing, with the following modification for precise library size selection. First, RNA 3\u2019 adaptor is specifically modified to target miRNAs and other small RNAs that have a 3\u2019 hydroxyl group resulting from enzymatic cleavage by Dicer or other RNA processing enzymes. After ligation, the excess 3\u2019 adaptor is removed by hybridization to prevent adaptor-dimer formation. Then, the 5\u2019 ends of miRNAs that have a 5\u2019-phosphate are ligated to the 5\u2019 adaptor. Following 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ligation, reverse transcription is performed to convert the ligated small RNAs into cDNA, and then uniquely indexed by PCR to generate the sequencing library. The libraries containing DNAs ranging from 135\u2013146 bp were purified on 2.75% agarose gels (using a custom-designed DNA ladder for 135\u2013146 bp mixed with library DNA) and eluted in 20 \u03bcl. Two \u03bcl of the libraries were then diluted (1:104) and analyzed by NEBNext Library Quant kit (NEB) using QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA). The quantified libraries were clustered onto a flow cell at the concentration of 15 pM using Illumina\u2019s TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3, and sequenced for 51 cycles using TruSeq SBS kit on Illumina HiSeq system. Sequence reads were aligned and analyzed for differential levels of individual miRNAs by The Laboratory for Statistical Genomics and Systems Biology in the University of Cincinnati.Statistical analysisData were plotted as means \u00b1 SEM and statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed t-test.ResultsFAK ablation in fibroblasts inhibits breast cancer metastasis in vivoTo study the potential role of FAK signaling in CAFs to promote breast cancer development and metastasis in vivo, we crossed MMTV-PyMT;FAKf/f mice  with Col1a2-CreER transgenic mice that express tamoxifen (TAM)-activated Cre recombinase in CAFs  to produce MMTV-PyMT;FAKf/f;Cre mice. They (and all strains used in this study) were backcrossed to FVB/N genetic background (syngeneic to the MMTV-PyMT mice used throughout the study) for seven or more times (>99%, or virtually pure FVB/N) to eliminate potential influence of genetic background on phenotypes. Cohorts of female MMTV-PyMT;FAKf/f;Cre mice were treated with vehicle (designated as Ctrl mice) or TAM (designated as cKO mice after induced FAK deletion) at 5 weeks of age every other day for 3 times [2 mg each time] (Fig. 1A). Unlike previous studies deleting FAK in tumor cells , ablation of FAK in CAFs did not affect endogenous mammary tumor development in cKO mice relative to Ctrl mice (Fig. 1B). Further, primary tumor growth was comparable in cKO and Ctrl mice (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, however, we observed that cKO mice developed metastasis at a significantly reduced frequency than Ctrl mice at 4 weeks after TAM treatments (Figs. 1D-1E).To verify FAK deletion in CAFs, tumor cells and CAFs were prepared from mammary tumors in cKO and Ctrl mice, as described previously . Western blot analysis of lysates showed FAK deletion specifically in CAFs, but not mammary tumor cells, from cKO mice (Figs. 1F-1H). We next isolated CAFs from lungs of these mice by FACS using PDGFR\u03b2 as a marker , and showed that FAK was deleted in cKO CAFs compared to CAFs from Ctrl mice (Figs. 1I-1J). Lung epithelial cells from cKO and Ctrl mice showed comparable levels of FAK (data not shown). Western blotting analysis using alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) as a marker for fibroblasts activation (i.e. CAFs) showed comparable levels of a-SMA in fibroblasts from cKO and Ctrl mice, suggesting that FAK deletion did not affect CAF formation in cKO mice. Together, these results suggest that FAK deletion in CAF suppressed breast cancer metastasis, although it did not affect primary mammary tumor development and growth.FAK signaling in CAFs is required for their promotion of tumor cell migration in vitroTo further evaluate a role of FAK signaling in CAFs to promote human breast cancer metastasis, we prepared human CAFs and examined their effects on human breast cancer cell migration in vitro. First, WI-38 human fibroblasts were incubated with conditioned media (CM) from several human breast cancer cells, and examined by western blotting using antibody for a-SMA (Figs. 2A-2B). We found that CM from MCF-7, HCC-1954 and MDA-231 breast cancer cells, but not MCF10A (a normal mammary epithelial cell line), induced WI-38 cells to a CAF-like state with increased expression of a-SMA. FAK phosphorylation was also increased in WI-38 cells treated with CM from these breast cancer cells, supporting a potential role for FAK signaling in CAFs. We next analyzed the ability of the treated WI-38 cells to promote migration of breast cancer cells, which is an important characteristic of metastasis. We found that WI-38 cells treated with HCC-1954 and MDA-231 CM promoted migration of these two breast cancers relative to WI-38 cells not treated (NT) with the CM, while those treated with MCF7 CM increased its migration slightly (Figs. 2C and 2D).To examine directly the role of FAK signaling in CAF, we generated WI-38 cells with stable FAK knockdown using lentiviral vectors for FAK shRNA and examined their ability to promote migration of MDA-231 cells following treatment with MDA-231 CM. We found that FAK knockdown did not change activation of WI-38 cells by MDA-231 CM, as measured by a-SMA expression (Fig. 2E). However, FAK knockdown abolished the ability of MDA-231 CM treated-WI-38 cells to promote migration of breast cancer cells (Fig. 2F). Consistent with these results using WI-38 cells, CAFs from Ctrl mice, but not those from cKO mice, showed greater ability to promote PyMT tumor cell migration, relative to lung fibroblasts from WT mice (Figs. 2G and 2H). Collectively, these results suggest that FAK signaling in CAFs is important for their ability to stimulate tumor cell migration, which were consistent with the decreased metastasis in cKO mice in vivo.FAK deletion in CAFs results in the reduced amount and defective exosomes for promoting tumor cell migration and other functionsExosomes are small micro vesicles containing functional biomolecules like proteins and RNAs, which can transfer between the donor cells and the recipient cells . To explore whether FAK signaling in CAFs regulates tumor cells through exosomes, we isolated and examined exosomes from Ctrl and cKO CAFs by ultracentrifugation of the CM, as described previously . We found comparable number of exosomes in CAFs from Ctrl and cKO mice (Fig. 3A). However, both protein and RNA contents were decreased in exosomes from cKO CAFs relative to those in Ctrl CAFs (Figs. 3B and 3C), suggesting that FAK deletion in CAFs reduced the amount of protein or RNA in exosomes. On the other hand, size distributions of exosomes isolated from CAFs of cKO and Ctrl mice were similar (Fig. 3D). Analyses of the exosome preparations by Western blotting showed that both Ctrl and cKO exosomes are enriched in various exosome proteins; including CD81 and Alix at comparable levels in both exosomes, and CD63 and integrin \u03b24 at reduced levels in exosomes from cKO CAFs relative to exosomes from Ctrl CAFs (Figs. 3E and 3F). FACS analysis using CD63 as a marker verified purities of greater than 99% in both exosomes from Ctrl and cKO CAFs (Fig. 3G). Electron microscopy further confirmed purity of exosome preparations, showing exosomes ranging between 70 to 170 nm (Fig. 3H), which is comparable to estimates by Nanosight (see Fig. 3D).We next examined the effect of CM from Ctrl CAFs with or without exosomes on PyMT tumor cell migration using wound closure assay. We found that while the Ctrl CM significantly increased tumor cell migration, this activity was much lower after removal of exosomes (Figs. 4A and 4B). CM from cKO CAFs also promoted tumor cell migration but to a less extent, and removal of exosomes from the media did not affect this activity (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, CM from cKO CAFs with exosome depletion showed greater activity to promote tumor cell migration than CM from Ctrl CAFs without exosomes (Fig. 4B), suggesting Ctrl exosomes are primarily responsible for the activity in CM from Ctrl CAFs whereas the activity over NT in CM of cKO CAFs are likely due to other factors (e.g. altered chemokine compositions). Indeed, adding back Ctrl CAF exosomes, but not cKO CAF exosomes, to the exosome-depleted CM promoted tumor cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Purified exosomes from Ctrl CAFs, but not those from cKO CAFs, also increased tumor cell colony formation in soft agar (Fig. 4D). Analysis of human CAFs also showed that knockdown of FAK by shRNA reduced the ability of CM from these cells to promote tumor cell migration and proliferation (Fig. S1). Previous studies suggested important roles of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) in metastasis , we therefore also examined the effect of CAF exosomes on BCSCs. We found that exosomes from Ctrl CAF increased tumor sphere formation of PyMT primary tumor cells compared to cKO exosomes or no addition (Fig. 4E). Consistent with these in vitro data, cKO mice showed decreased amount of BCSCs than Ctrl mice, as measured by ALDH assays (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results suggest that FAK signaling in CAFs regulates the generation of exosomes and their functions to promote breast cancer metastasis. Regulation of miR-16 and miR-148a in CAF exosomes by FAK contributes to altered ability of CAFs to affect tumor cell activity and metastasisMiRNAs encapsulated in exosomes are abundant and play important roles in inter-cellular communications . We therefore hypothesized that FAK deletion in CAFs alter miRNAs in exosomes to abolish their activity to promote tumor cell functions and metastasis. To identify the specific miRNAs involved, we performed miRNA-sequencing of CAF-derived exosomes to generate miRNA profiles from Ctrl and cKO mice (n= 3 for each). Comparative analysis of miRNA profiles identified 3 decreased miRNAs and 4 increased miRNAs in cKO CAF-derived exosomes relative to those from Ctrl mice (Fig. 5A). Using additional preparations of CAF-derived exosomes of Ctrl and cKO mice, qRT-PCR further confirmed reduced levels of miR-34b, miR-409 and miR-494 as well as increased amount of miR-16, miR-148a and miR-326 in cKO CAF-derived exosomes (Fig. 5B), suggesting that these exosomal miRs may mediate CAF regulation of mammary tumor metastasis in cKO mice.We next prepared exosomes from human WI-38 cells with or without FAK knockdown (see Fig. 2E) that had been treated MDA-231 CM and examined the levels of these miRs. MiR-16 and miR-148a showed increased expression in WI-38 cells with FAK knockdown, consistent with results in mouse CAFs, although miR-326 was not increased after FAK knockdown (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly, we did not find the decreased expression of miR-409 or miR-494 in WI-38 cells after FAK knockdown, and miR-34b was not detected in WI-38 cells with or without FAK knockdown. Similar analysis in WI-38 cells treated with MCF-7 CM showed that FAK knockdown did not change the levels of any of these miRs (Fig. S2), which is consistent with the observation that WI-38 cells treated with MCF-7 CM did not affect migration of these cells (see Fig. 2D). These results further support that exosomal miR-16 and/or miR-148a play a role in mediating CAF regulation of recipient tumor cells. Indeed, both miR-16 and miR-148a have been reported to act as tumor suppressive miRs in different cancers including breast cancer . Thus, it is possible that exosomes from CAFs lacking FAK (either from cKO mice, or human WI-38 cells with FAK knockdown) and enriched with miR-16 and/or miR-148a inhibit various tumor cell activities compared to exosomes from Ctrl CAFs (see Figs. 4C-4F and S1).To further evaluate this notion, we examined expression of a series of putative targets of miR-16 and miR-148a in the recipient MDA-231 cells treated by exosomes from human CAFs with or without FAK knockdown. We found that miR-16 targets CCNE1 and TWIST1 as well as miR-148a targets WNT1 and WNT10B were significantly decreased in tumor cells treated with exosomes from CAFs with FAK knockdown compared to those treated with exosomes from Ctrl CAFs (Figs. 5D and 5E). Moreover, decreased levels of Twist1 and Ccne1 proteins were found in tumor cells treated with exosomes from cKO CAFs vs those from Ctrl CAFs (Fig. S3). We next used inhibitors against miR-16 and miR-148a to further validate their roles in decreasing mammary tumor cell activities. As expected, transfection of miR-148a and miR-16 inhibitors restored the levels of miR-148a targets CCNE1 and Twist1 and miR-16 target Wnt10b, respectively, in tumor cells treated with exosomes from cKO CAFs (Fig. S4). Importantly, transfection of either of these inhibitors reversed inhibition of tumor cell migration and proliferation by exosomes from cKO CAFs (Figs. 5F and 5G). Moreover, transfection of these two inhibitors into cKO CAFs also reduced the levels of corresponding miR-148a and miR-16 in exosomes derived from these cells (Fig. S5A), as expected, and these exosomes induced more tumor cell migration compared to exosomes from cKO CAFs treated with scrambled control (Fig. S5B). These results confirmed efficacy of the inhibitors, and are consistent with the idea that the increased amount of miR-16 and miR-148 in exosome from cKO CAF is responsible for the lower migration of tumor cells compared to those treated with Ctrl CAF exosomes. Lastly, miR-148a and miR-16 inhibitors did not affect the base line proliferation of tumor cells (i.e. those without exosome treatment)(Fig. S6), supporting that they acted on reserving the effect of corresponding miRNAs enriched in exosomes from cKO CAFs which were delivered to tumor cells. Together, these results suggested that miR-16 and miR-148a enriched in exosomes from FAK-null CAFs play a key role in decreasing mammary tumor cell functions and metastasis (Fig. S7). DiscussionCancer is increasingly recognized as a disease involving abnormalities in both tumor cells and other surrounding cells within TME as well as altered communications between the cells . It is well established that malignant cancer cells can activate multiple mechanisms to \u201ceducate\u201d both local and distant fibroblasts into CAFs, which in turn influence various cancer cell behavior to promote cancer metastasis to distant organs. By creating a fibroblast-specific inducible FAK knockout in a mouse model of breast cancer as well as knocking down FAK in human CAFs, we showed a critical role for FAK signaling in CAFs for metastasis. Therefore, unlike some other key signaling molecules that could play opposing roles in cancer vs stromal cells for cancer progression and metastasis , FAK\u2019s function in CAFs as well as its pro-tumorigenesis role in tumor and endothelial cells  highlight significant potential for FAK inhibitors for systemic cancer therapy by attacking both tumor cells and multiple cells in TME crucial for cancer metastasis.Besides well-established roles of FAK in mediating intracellular signaling in tumor and other cells, recent studies suggested new functions for FAK in the regulation of TME through affecting intercellular communications. FAK in tumor cells has been implicated in creating an immune suppressive TME through inflammatory chemokine production and tumor-associated regulatory T cells (Tregs) recruitment . Other studies suggested a role for FAK in regulating the composition of the fibrotic and immune-suppressive niche in pancreatic tumor model . Our results reveal new FAK functions in fibroblasts required for their activation to CAFs in response to tumor cells, and more importantly the ability of CAFs to promote breast tumor cell migration. FAK can regulate diverse signaling pathways through its phosphorylation of and interaction with multiple other molecules. Using FAK mutant knock-in alleles in breast cancer models, we showed previously that FAK kinase activity was required for some, but not other, subtypes of breast cancer , and that FAK interaction with endophilin A2 specifically affect breast cancer stem cell pool but not bulk tumor cells . It will be interesting to determine the role of FAK kinase activity and specific downstream pathways in its regulation of CAF-derived exosomal miRNAs to promote breast cancer metastasis using similar strategies.Exosomes have emerged as an important mediator of inter-cellular communication between various cells. Our findings are consistent with a number of previous studies showing promotion of breast cancer cell migration and metastasis by CAF-derived exosomes .Moreover, these data provide strong support for a role of exosomal miRNAs in mediating the the reduced metastasis upon FAK ablation in CAFs of cKO mice, although we could not exclude potential contribution by changes in exosomal RNAs and/or proteins from cKO CAFs (e.g. decreased amount of integrin \u03b24 and/or CD63, see Figs. 3E and 3F). We found that FAK ablation in CAFs increased levels of exosomal miR-148a, which decreased WNT1 and WNT10B expression in the recipient cancer cells. These data provided further support the previous observation that CAF exosomes stimulate Wnt-PCP signaling to drive breast cancer cell invasive activities . Our studies also showed increased levels of exosomal miR-16 from FAK-null CAFs that decreased other genes CCNE1 and TWIST1 to reduced cancer cell proliferation and EMT. Besides the increased tumor suppressive miR-148a and miR-16, we also found reduced levels of oncogenic miRs-34b, 409 and 494 in CAF-derived exosomes of cKO mice. However, we did not detect similar decreases of these oncogenic miRs in human CAFs following FAK knockdown, which could be due to incomplete ablation of FAK in these cells by knockdown approach. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that inhibition of one or more of the oncogenic miRs will reduce the ability of CAF exosomes to promote metastasis in cKO mice, possibly in conjunction with the increased levels of tumor suppressive miR-16 and/or miR-148a, as discussed above. Indeed, one caveat in support of the roles of increased miR-16 and miR-148a in cKO CAFs is the reduced amount of cKO exosomes compared to that from Ctrl CAFs (thus cancelling out the net effect of the enriched miRs on per exosome basis). However, multiple miRs may act in an integrated manner to influence recipient tumor cell behavior, and in such a case, both the reduced oncogenic miRs and the enriched suppressive miRs from the overall reduced exosome amount in cKO CAFs may be involved.Cancer metastasis is a complex, multiple stage process including tumor cell intravasation into the blood or lymphatic vasculature at the primary tumor site, survival in the blood/lymphatic vessels, and colonization and growth at the metastatic site such as the lung. Interestingly, we found that FAK ablation in CAFs inhibited breast cancer metastasis, but it had no apparent effects on the development and growth of primary tumors. Thus, it is possible that defective CAFs at the lung metastatic sites could be responsible for the reduced colonization and/or growth at the tumor cells to inhibit metastasis observed in cKO mice. Alternatively, our data showing that FAK ablation diminished the ability of CAFs to promote tumor cell migration are also consistent with the possibility that cKO CAFs affected metastasis by reduced support for tumor cell intravasation despite not affecting the primary tumor development or growth. Future studies will be directed towards examining these possibilities to further dissect the mechanism involved. We also noted that FAK-null CAF exosomes with enriched miR-16 and miR-148a inhibited proliferation of tumor cells in vitro, although primary tumor growth was not affected in cKO mice in vivo. It is possible that primary tumors developed compensatory mechanisms so that their growth was less dependent on possible effects of FAK-null CAFs in vivo. Another, not mutually exclusive possibility is that tumor cells metastasized to the lungs have a more stringent requirement for their microenvironment including CAFs to support their growth to form lung nodules (and FAK deletion in CAFs compromising such supportive function), which is reflected in the in vitro assays. Lastly, though less likely, it is also possible that FAK signaling is preferentially more important in lung CAFs (where they were isolated for the in vitro assays) than CAFs associated with primary tumors in mammary gland. Future studies will be necessary to gain additional mechanistic insights using our unique mouse models and reagents derived from them. Likewise, it will also be interesting to evaluate potential differential changes in specific subsets of CAFs upon FAK deletion and their contributions to the reduced metastasis in vivo, given recent studies showing multiple subsets of CAFs that could support or suppress tumor progression . Lastly, defective CAFs upon FAK ablation could modulate other TME components such as immune cells and ECs to impact indirectly on cancer metastasis. The availability of the fibroblast-specific cKO mice described here, along with FAK cKO mice in ECs  and mammary tumor cells  will offer appropriate models to fully understand the complex mechanism of FAK signaling in the regulation of metastasis in vivo.In summary, our studies revealed a new function for FAK in intercellular communication between CAFs in TME and mammary tumor cells important for cancer cell migration and metastasis. FAK ablation in CAFs impaired their ability to promote cancer cell migration and other activities due to alterations in exosomal miRs. These findings provide new insights into the complex role of FAK signaling in TME and cross-talk with mammary tumor cells and further highlight the potential of targeting FAK in the development of systemic and effective therapy for advanced and metastatic breast cancer.Supplementary MaterialReferencesCancer-associated fibroblasts as another polarized cell type of the tumor microenvironmentA potent far-upstream enhancer in the mouse pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene regulates expression of reporter genes in transgenic miceFrequent deletions and down-regulation of micro- RNA genes miR15 and miR16 at 13q14 in chronic lymphocytic leukemiaFibroblast Heterogeneity and Immunosuppressive Environment in Human Breast CancerIdentification of two distinct carcinoma-associated fibroblast subtypes with differential tumor-promoting abilities in oral squamous cell carcinomaCancer stem cells: models and conceptsCancer-associated fibroblasts release exosomal microRNAs that dictate an aggressive phenotype in breast cancerp62/SQSTM1 by Binding to Vitamin D Receptor Inhibits Hepatic Stellate Cell Activity, Fibrosis, and Liver CancerFunction of focal adhesion kinase scaffolding to mediate endophilin A2 phosphorylation promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and mammary cancer stem cell activities in vivoFocal adhesion kinase and p53 signaling in cancer cellsA protocol for exosome isolation and characterization: evaluation of ultracentrifugation, density-gradient separation, and immunoaffinity capture methodsHallmarks of cancer: the next generationExosome-mediated microRNA signaling from breast cancer cells is altered by the anti-angiogenesis agent docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)Tumour exosome integrins determine organotropic metastasisMesenchymal-specific deletion of C/EBPbeta suppresses pulmonary fibrosisTargeting focal adhesion kinase renders pancreatic cancers responsive to checkpoint immunotherapyThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerMammary epithelial-specific disruption of the focal adhesion kinase blocks mammary tumor progressionThe Role of Mir-148a in CancerExosomes mediate stromal mobilization of autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling in breast cancer cell migrationMammary epithelial-specific ablation of the focal adhesion kinase suppresses mammary tumorigenesis by affecting mammary cancer stem/progenitor cellsDistinct FAK activities determine progenitor and mammary stem cell characteristicsThe role of focal-adhesion kinase in cancer - a new therapeutic opportunityStromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFocal adhesion kinase: the first ten yearsMammary epithelial-specific disruption of focal adhesion kinase retards tumor formation and metastasis in a transgenic mouse model of human breast cancerRas- and PI3K-dependent breast tumorigenesis in mice and humans requires focal adhesion kinase signalingDownregulation of the tumor-suppressor miR-16 via progestin-mediated oncogenic signaling contributes to breast cancer developmentThe increasing complexity of the cancer stem cell paradigmThe Biology of Cancer Exosomes: Insights and New PerspectivesBiochemical signals and biological responses elicited by the focal adhesion kinaseMultiple connections link FAK to cell motility and invasionNuclear FAK Controls Chemokine Transcription, Tregs, and Evasion of Anti-tumor ImmunityIL-33 and ST2 mediate FAK-dependent antitumor immune evasion through transcriptional networksCancer-Associated Fibroblasts: Their Characteristics and Their Roles in Tumor GrowthLoss of the Timp gene family is sufficient for the acquisition of the CAF-like cell stateThe signaling and biological implications of FAK overexpression in cancerExosomes--vesicular carriers for intercellular communicationMolecular heterogeneity of breast carcinomas and the cancer stem cell hypothesisCD10(+)GPR77(+) Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessNuclear FAK and its kinase activity regulate VEGFR2 transcription in angiogenesis of adult miceFAK-inhibition opens the door to checkpoint immunotherapyEndothelial FAK is required for tumour angiogenesisEndothelial-cell FAK targeting sensitizes tumours to DNA-damaging therapyCommunication by Extracellular Vesicles: Where We Are and Where We Need to Gop62, Upregulated during Preneoplasia, Induces Hepatocellular Carcinogenesis by Maintaining Survival of Stressed HCC-Initiating CellsCancer stem cells: an old idea--a paradigm shiftSignal transduction by focal adhesion kinase in cancerRole of kinase-independent and -dependent functions of FAK in endothelial cell survival and barrier function during embryonic developmentLigand-dependent genetic recombination in fibroblasts : a potentially powerful technique for investigating gene function in fibrosisFAK ablation in fibroblasts inhibits breast cancer metastasis.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of CAFs on infiltration of TAMs and lymphatic metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).Material and methods: The study included 278 patients with histologically confirmed TNBC. Immunohistochemical staining of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and fibroblast activation protein were used to identify CAFs. Polarized functional status of infiltrated TAMs was detected by expression of CD163. The clinicopathological features were assessed from all the patients' medical records.Results: The CAFs-related markers were found to be expressed more frequently in TNBC patents with aggressive behaviors, including recurrence and poor histological differentiation. High activation of CAFs was positively correlated with elevated infiltration of polarized CD163-positive TAMs and lymph node metastasis in TNBC patients. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the activation of CAFs, TAMs infiltration, and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival in TNBC patients.Conclusion: Cancer-associated fibroblasts were associated with infiltration of CD163-positive macrophages and lymphatic metastasis, and may be potential prognostic predictors of TNBC.IntroductionBreast cancer is by far the most common cause of cancer-related death for women in China. Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

        "content": "The biological heterogeneity of breast cancer leads to the need for finding new approaches to understand the mechanisms implicated in breast cancer progression. The tumor stroma appears as a key in the progression of solid tumors towards a malignant phenotype. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may orchestrate a functional \"corrupted\" stroma which in turn helps metastatic spread. In this study, we investigated by real-time PCR, the expression of 19 factors by normal breast-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) and CAFs, which were implicated in several actions promoting tumor growth, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation and invasion. Also, we explored the influence of inflammatory cells phenotypes (MMP11 status) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) on the molecular profile of CAFs. If we consider that one of the major sources of CAFs are resident NAFs, the transition of NAFs into CAFs is associated with molecular changes involving the overexpression of some molecular factors of biological importance in tumor progression. In addition, the characterization of the tumor stroma regarding to the MMP11 status by MICs reflects a type of fibroblasts which contribute even more to tumor progression. Moreover, different patterns in the induction of the expression of factors by CAFs were observed, depending on the tumor cell line which they were co-cultured with. Furthermore, CAFs influence TGF\u03b2 expression in both cancer cell lines. Therefore, this study can help to a better characterization of tumor stroma in order to improve the prognostic evaluation, as well as to define the different populations of CAFs as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "content": "Tumors are supported by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are heterogeneous and carry out distinct cancer-associated functions. Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

BC mouse models were injected with DIR labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 or Exo-M1. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC cells was determined by PCR and Western blot. PKH67 labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 were incubated with NFs or MCF-7 to measure the activation of CAFs. Cell invasion and migration abilities were determined by scratch test and Transwell assay. Exo-MA, Exo-M7, Exo-M1 were successfully extracted with positive expressions of Alix, CD63 and TSG101. Contents of Ki67, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail-1 were increased but E-cadherin was decreased, compared to Exo-MA group. Exo-M7 or Exo-M1 could increase BC cell proliferation and enhance EMT in nude mouse. Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 could accelerate the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote the recruitment of CAFs in MCF-7. Transfection of miR-146a could promote the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote cell invasion and migration of MCF-7\u00a0cells. As a target gene of miR-146a, TXNIP could inhibit the activation of CAFs. miR-146a overexpression or TXNIP silence enhance the activation of Wnt signal pathway. BC-derived exosomes promote the activation of CAFs through miR-146a/TXNIP axis to activate Wnt pathway, which in turn enhances invasion and metastasis of BC cells.",

These interactions in turn promote the invasion of the parenchyma of surrounding tissues and of distant organs by invasive/metastatic tumor cells. At the center of this behavior of invasive cancer cells is the formation of mature and functional adhesion plaques at sites of cell contact with the ECM and/or adherens junctions between the tumor cells on one hand and on the other hand, between normal and tumor cells. Adhesion plaques and adherens junctions are stabilized by the highly dynamic actin cytoskeleton that in turn is modulated by a large number of actin binding proteins. Amongst these proteins are members of the annexin family of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding proteins.Annexins Ca2+-dependently interact with distinct plasma membrane regions to promote membrane segregation and each annexin family member requires a different Ca2+ concentration for its translocation to the membrane. Although their precise functions remain unclear, their Ca2+ responsiveness and membrane binding properties, suggests that annexins may link Ca2+ signaling with actin dynamics at membrane contact sites. Available evidence nevertheless reveal that annexins regulate a multitude of signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, cell motility, tumor invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, apoptosis and drug resistance via distinct mechanisms.Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is an unusual member of the annexin family in that it contains eight rather than four annexin repeats. Consequently, it has been shown to interact with biological membranes with slightly different kinetics compared with other members of the family. In a recent study, constitutive plasma membrane targeting of AnxA6 not only stabilized the cortical actin cytoskeleton but also inhibited store-operated Ca2+ influx and cell proliferation. In support of these observations, ectopic expression of AnxA6 in the AnxA6-null A431 squamous epithelial carcinoma cells reduced their proliferation. Other studies have also shown that AnxA6 is down-regulated in chronic myeloid leukemia and as melanomas progress from a benign to a more malignant phenotype. Meanwhile, depletion of AnxA6 in MDA-MB-436 invasive breast cancer cells led to increased anchorage-independent cell proliferation. Together this suggests that in breast cancer AnxA6 may not only act as a tumor suppressor but also as a cell adhesion/motility promoting factor.In the present study we examined the involvement of AnxA6 in adhesion-related cellular processes that contribute to breast cancer progression. We demonstrate that AnxA6 expression correlates with the invasive phenotype of breast cancer and that depletion of this protein in the invasive BT-549 breast cancer cells inhibited cellular adhesion, motility and invasiveness. We also show that that the enhanced anchorage-independent proliferation of BT-549 cells following AnxA6 depletion requires sustained MAP kinase activation, while the loss of invasiveness of AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells may be attributed to its role in the formation of functional focal contacts at appropriate plasma membrane locations and that this is driven by the activation of the phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase/Akt pathway. These data suggest that reduced AnxA6 expression contributes to breast cancer progression by promoting the loss of functional cell-cell and/or cell-ECM contacts and anchorage-independent cell proliferation.Materials and MethodsMaterialsPolyclonal antibodies to AnxA2, AnxA4, AnxA6 as well as phospho-focal adhesion kinase (p-Y397) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Polyclonal antibodies to E-cadherin, N-Cadherin, phospho-PKB/Akt (p-S473) and phospho-ERK1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). Monoclonal antibodies to ERK2 as well as HRP, FITC or Texas red-conjugated secondary antibodies were also purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., (Santa Cruz, CA USA). Monoclonal antibody to \u03b2-actin and vinculin, were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded thin sections of normal human breast and breast cancer tissues were purchased from Biomax-US (Rockville, MD, USA). Except otherwise indicated cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen or Sigma.Cell lines and cell cultureThe breast cancer cell lines BT-549, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and MCF-10A were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). A sub-clone of BT-549 cells stably over-expressing Galectin-3 (clone 11-9-1-4) herein designated BT-Gal3, was a gift from Dr. Avraham Raz (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA). These cell lines were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's nutrient F12 (DMEM/F12) medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml) in a 95% air and 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C. Human mammary epithelial cells (HuMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Jennifer Pietenpol (Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt Medical Center, Nashville, TN) and were cultured in complete HuMEC Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from ATCC and maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml). The media were changed every 2 to 3 days and except otherwise indicated, cells were sub-cultured by treatment with 0.25% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).RNAiSub-confluent BT-549 cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) seeded in six-well plates were transfected with 4 \u03bcg/well of purified AnxA6-targeted short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in plasmid pSM2c (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) by using Fugene6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Biochemicals). The sequences of the targeted sense region are A6A 5\u2019-CACTCGGACCAATGCTGA-3\u2019 and A6B 5\u2019-GACCTCATTGCTGATTTAA-3\u2019. Puromycin (2.5\u03bcg/ml) surviving clones were isolated and propagated in selection medium (complete DMEM/F12 containing 2.0 \u03bcg/ml puromycin) as long as the cells were in culture. AnxA6 down regulation in the stable BT-549 clones was verified by western blotting and immunofluorescence using polyclonal antibodies to AnxA6.Isolation of secreted and surface-associated proteinsCells were cultured until they attained 70-80% confluence. These were then harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in HBSS (Hepes-buffered saline: 11 mM Hepes, 137 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1 mM glucose) and equal numbers incubated in HBSS with or without 2 mM Ca2+ for two hrs at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g for 4 min and the culture supernatants (CS) containing total secreted proteins were transferred to new tubes. These were cleared of any cells by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The final supernatant containing the secreted proteins was concentrated by ultrafiltration using the Millipore MCO-3,000 ultrafiltration unit and equal volumes of the extracts used for analysis.EGTA-elution of surface associated proteins was performed as previously described. Briefly, cells pretreated with or without Ca2+ as above were washed once with HBSS and incubated with HBSS containing 10 mM EGTA for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with occasional shaking. The cells were once again harvested by centrifugation at 500 \u00d7 g for 4 min and the supernatant containing EGTA-solubilized surface-associated proteins (SAP) was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. These were analyzed alongside total cell lysates and the secreted proteins.Cell fractionationTotal cellular proteins were prepared by resuspending cells in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and incubation on ice for 30 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the preparation of cytosolic and membrane-enriched cellular fractions, cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), homogenized by passage six times through 26G needle and incubated on ice for 30 min. The homogenates were centrifuged at 2,300 \u00d7 g for 4 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate the nuclei from the post nuclear supernatants. The post nuclear supernatants were in turn centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C using the Sorvall M150 micro-ultracentrifuge and S120-AT2 rotor. The resulting supernatants comprising cytosolic proteins were transferred to new tubes while the pellets (membrane-enriched faction) were extracted in ice-cold RIPA buffer for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatant containing the solubilized membrane proteins was transferred to new tubes. The protein content of total cellular proteins or various fractions was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and equal amounts of proteins used for protein electrophoresis and immunoblotting as previously described.ImmunohistochemistryMicroscope slides containing thin sections of paraffin-embedded formalin fixed normal, mucous adenocarcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma human breast tissues (US Biomax, Rockville, MD) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated with decreasing graded alcohol. Antigen retrieval was performed in 0.1M sodium citrate pH 6.0 by heating to 95-96 \u00b0C for 20 minutes followed by cooling to room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase blocking, incubation with the indicated primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were performed as described in the Labeled Streptavidin-Biotin HRP kit (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA). The thin sections were subsequently treated with diaminobenzidine substrate and counterstained with hematoxylin for 5 min. Slides were then dehydrated through a graded series of alcohol, cleared in xylene and mounted with cover slips. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioscope Microscope. Quantification was performed from four randomly chosen fields using NIH ImageJ software.ImmunofluorescenceCells were grown on glass cover slips in complete DMEM/F12 overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Except otherwise indicated the cells were serum-starved for 24 h by cultivating them in complete DMEM/F12 in which FBS was replaced with 0.1% BSA. The cells were subsequently fixed in -20 \u00b0C cold methanol or in 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed once with ice-cold HBSS and fixed in 3% PFA in PBS. For observation of adhesion plaques, cells were pretreated with 3% PFA in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min followed by fixation in 3% PFA. Cells were then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS, then incubated with first and secondary antibodies as recently described. For detection of surface-associated AnxA6, non permeabilized PFA-fixed cells were probed with monoclonal anti-AnxA6 antibody followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Samples were washed extensively between the treatments and cover slips were mounted with Prolong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen). F-actin was detected by incubating PFA-fixed and permeabilized cells with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) diluted 1/20 in PBS. Samples were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000-E inverted microscope equipped with NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA).Cell Proliferation AssaysFor anchorage-independent growth, cells were cultured in complete medium in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly(Hema))-coated plates were prepared as previously described. For growth curves in 2D cultures, cells were plated into a 96-well flat bed plate at a density of 2 \u00d7 103 cells per well in triplicate then incubated for up to 7 days with medium changed every 3 days. At the end of each time point the alamar blue reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was diluted 1:10 in HBSS supplemented with 1 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+. The culture medium was aspirated and replaced with 100 \u03bcl of diluted reagent per well, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 4-6 h. The proliferation and viability of the cells was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 versus 600 nm.Cell adhesion/spreadingWells of 96-well plates were coated in quadruplicate with 0.5 mg/ml Fetuin-A, 0.1 mg/ml of either collagen type I, collagen type IV, laminin or fibronectin overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Prior to use in cell attachment/spreading assays, the coating solutions were aspirated and 1 \u00d7 104 cells in serum-free DMEM/F12 were added to each well and incubated overnight (16-24 h) at 37 \u00b0C. Controls cells were seeded in complete DMEM/F12 or serum-free DMEM/F12. After aspirating the floating cells the attached cells were photographed using DCM200 digital camera equipped with Scopephoto software (ScopeTek, Hangzhou, China) and cell numbers and viability estimated by alamar blue colorimetric assay as described above.Three-dimensional growth on MatrigelThis was performed as described previously. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of growth factor reduced Matrigel (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA, USA) were dispensed into wells of a 96-well microtitre plate and allowed to gel at 37 \u00b0C for at least 30 min. Cells were trypsinized, washed and resuspended in complete DMEM/F12 medium and then plated at a density of 5 \u00d7 103 cells per well. These were then incubated for up to 10 days with medium changes after every 4 days. The 3-D structures were captured with DCM200 digital camera and Scopephoto software.Transwell Migration and Invasion AssaysMigration and invasion assays were determined in triplicate using 24-well, 8 \u03bcm pore transwell inserts and Matrigel coated transwell invasion chambers respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA, USA). Briefly, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice and resuspended in serum-free DMEM/F12. DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS was then added to the lower chamber as the chemoattractant and 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 500 \u03bcl of serum-free DMEM/F12 were added to the upper insert chamber or on the Matrigel layer. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h the cell suspension in the upper chamber was aspirated and excess Matrigel and/or cells on the insert membrane were removed using a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated through the insert membrane or invaded the Matrigel and insert membrane and reached the lower surface of the filter were subsequently fixed in 3% PFA in PBS, stained with crystal violet and counted under a light microscope. Digital images were captured with DCM200 digital camera and Scopephoto software (ScopeTek, Hangzhou, China). Three random fields were counted for each sample.ResultsCell surface expression of annexins in breast cancer cells occurs via the exosomal pathwayPrevious studies in our laboratory demonstrated that AnxA2, AnxA4 and AnxA6 interact with the abundant serum glycoprotein fetuin-A on the surface of BT-549 breast cancer cells. Since the interaction of annexins with membranes exhibit a high degree of Ca2+ sensitivity these proteins can be efficiently eluted by EGTA treatment of the intact cells. To test the possibility that other breast cancer cells express and externalize annexins, we treated MCF-7, BT-549, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines as well as MCF-10A known to retain many characteristics of normal breast epithelial cells with EGTA to elute the Ca2+-dependently cell surface-associated proteins (herein denoted SAP). As shown in Fig. 1A, the three breast cancer cell lines express AnxA2, AnxA4 and AnxA6. Surprisingly, MCF-10A cells are AnxA6-null (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 6). In the annexin-positive cell lines these proteins are also detected in the EGTA-solubilized SAP extracts. However, the expression levels of AnxA2 and AnxA4 are up-regulated in the AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells and in the AnxA6-null MCF-10A (Fig. 1A and supplementary Fig. 1A and B).To show that surface expression of these proteins involves their secretion via the exosomal pathway, BT-549 cells were cultured in HBSS with or without Ca2+ for 2 h and the secreted proteins in the culture supernatants (CS) were fractionated into exosome-free (ExF) and exosome-associated (Exos) fractions as recently described. At the end of the treatment the viability of the cells by the Trypan blue exclusion method was at least 98%. To verify that the viability of the cells was not affected by incubation in HBSS or HBSS/EGTA we used a cytotoxicity assay based on secreted lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). As shown in supplementary Fig. S1C and D the basal secretion of LDH by adherent BT-549 cells in complete DMEM/F12 was ~11.5% of total cellular LDH (data not shown). Secretion in HBSS at 37 \u00b0C ranged from 8.3-10.1% over the 2 h period and 5.2-7.6% in HBSS/EGTA on ice. Analysis of the secreted fractions, the corresponding SAP extracts and total cellular proteins by immunoblotting revealed that AnxA2 and AnxA6 are Ca2+-dependently secreted by these cells (compare Fig. 1B lanes 4 and 5). The secreted proteins were enriched in the exosomal fractions (Fig. 1B lanes 8 and 9) compared to the exosome-free fractions (Fig. 1B lanes 6 and 7). As expected, Fig. 1B also shows that these proteins were more abundant in the membrane-associated, EGTA-solubilized extracts than in the culture supernatants (Fig. 1B lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 4 and 5). Finally, as shown in Fig. 1C, AnxA6 is at least 6-fold more abundant on the surface of BT-549 cells than AnxA2. Similar low levels (< 5% of total cellular AnxA2) of cell-surface-associated AnxA2 were also observed in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (data not shown).To verify the expression of AnxA6 in BT-549 cells, cells were pretreated with or without 2.0 mM Ca2+ and stained with monoclonal antibodies to AnxA6 and co-stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (F-actin) and DAPI (nuclei). As depicted in supplementary Fig. S2, and as expected, AnxA6 co-localized with F-actin. In most of the cells, AnxA6 and actin are concentrated in the plasma membrane with discernible membrane protrusions. The intensity of AnxA6 and F-actin in these membrane protrusions increased with Ca2+ concentration (supplementary Fig. S2A, arrows) and may represent early stages of cell adhesion. To demonstrate that a pool of AnxA6 is cell surface-associated, non-permeabilized cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody to AnxA6. This revealed that cell surface-associated AnxA6 is concentrated in the membrane protrusions (Fig. S2B, arrows).AnxA6 influences growth and adhesion-related properties of BT-549 breast carcinoma cellsBased on the above data, we hypothesized that AnxA6 may influence the adhesion-related properties (cellular adhesion, motility and invasiveness) of invasive breast cancer cells by linking the cell surface to the ECM (extracellular AnxA6) or the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton (intracellular AnxA6). To test this hypothesis, we established stable AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells by transfecting these cells with shRNA constructs designated A6A and A6B which target distinct regions of AnxA6 coding sequence (ANXA6 transcript variant 1, accession number NM_001155.3). Analysis of the transfected cells by western blotting (Fig. 2A) revealed that depletion of AnxA6 was more efficient in the A6A shRNA transfected cells (herein designated BT-A6A) compared to the A6B shRNA transfected cells (herein designated BT-A6B). The extent of down regulation was >98% in BT-A6A and ~40% in BT-A6B cells compared to the parental or empty vector transfected cells (Fig. 2B). We also show that depletion of AnxA6 in BT-549 cells led to about 2-fold (range 1.5-3 fold) increase in the expression levels of AnxA2 and AnxA4 (Fig. 2A, lane 3). This was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies to these annexin family members (supplementary Fig. 3).To determine any changes in cell morphology following AnxA6 depletion, parental BT-549, BT-A6A and BT-A6B cells were grown on cell culture plastics in complete medium and examined by phase contract microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2C, compared to the parental BT-549 cells (upper panel), the BT-A6A cells (middle panel) are characteristically spindle-shaped while the BT-A6B cells (lower panel) have characteristically long lamellipodia. This reveals that reduced AnxA6 expression dose dependently altered the morphology of BT-549 cells.Given the efficient depletion of AnxA6 in the BT-A6A cells these were used in most of the subsequent experiments with the parental BT-549 cells as the control. We first wanted to verify whether AnxA6 is indispensable for anchorage-dependent growth. Parental BT-549 and BT-A6A cells were seeded onto plates coated with or without polyHEMA in complete DMEM/F12 medium and the cell populations observed for up to 48 hrs. As depicted in Fig. 3A, parental BT-549 cells grew as cell masses in anchorage-independent mode while AnxA6-depleted cells proliferated as single cells. In agreement with the growth of AnxA6-depleted MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells, BT-A6A cells continued to proliferate without attaining confluence while the parental cells were confluent by day four (Fig. 3B). This suggests that AnxA6 expression is essential for the formation of cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts and that loss of AnxA6 abolishes contact inhibition and promotes anchorage-independent cell proliferation.To ascertain that AnxA6-depletion abolished contact inhibition, BT-549 and BT-A6A cells were cultured on fetuin-A or fibronectin coated cover slips and visualized by F-actin staining. Fig. 3C shows that BT-A6A cells grew as clumps on fetuin-A coated cover slips (Fig. 3C, left panel) but surprisingly, these cells attached and spread on fibronectin-coated cover slips (Fig. 3C, right panel). As a consequence of this loss in contact inhibition, BT-A6A cells do not form confluent monolayers and require longer times (16-48h) to attach when cultured in complete medium containing 10% FBS unlike the parental cells. The observed defects in cell adhesion and spreading were however, reversed when BT-A6A cells were cultured in serum-free conditioned medium from the parental BT-549 cells which as shown in Fig. 1 contain AnxA6 (supplementary Fig. S4).Based on the differential attachment and spreading of BT-A6A cells on either fetuin-A- and fibronectin-coated cover slips (Fig. 3C), we next tested the attachment and spreading of BT-549 and BT-A6A cells on other extracellular matrix components. To do this these cell lines cells were cultured on fetuin-A, collagen type I, collagen type IV, laminin or Fibronectin-coated tissue culture plastics. Cells grown in serum-free medium (SFM) or complete medium (FBS) were used as controls. As shown in (Fig. 4A, a) and as expected the attachment of parental BT-549 cells in serum-free medium (SFM) was strongly attenuated but they efficiently attached and spread in complete medium (FBS) (Fig. 4A, b and b\u2019). Under similar conditions only about 30% of BT-A6A cells showed signs of spreading (seen as spindle-shaped cells) in complete medium but the cells remained rounded in serum-free medium (Fig. 4A, a\u2019). On fetuin-A-coated plates (FET) and as recently reported BT-549 cells were able to spread albeit less effectively compared to spreading in serum-supplemented medium. On the other hand, the spreading of BT-A6A cells on fetuin-A was virtually abolished (Fig. 4A, c and c\u2019). While adhesion and spreading of either parental BT-549 or BT-A6A cells onto collagen type I (Col I) was less efficient (Fig. 4A, d and d\u2019) both cell lines adhered and efficiently spread on fibronectin (Fig. 4A, f and f\u2019) and on laminin (data not shown). Interestingly, while BT-549 cells attached and spread on collagen type IV-coated plates (Col IV), BT-A6A cells grown on collagen type IV-coated plates remained mostly rounded (Fig. 4A, e and e\u2019). To verify that these cells were viable even though the AnxA6-depleted cells were rounded and/or loosely attached to the various substrata, the number and viability of the adhering cells were estimated using the alamar blue assay. Fig. 4B confirms that a greater number of BT-549 cells were retained in plates coated with FBS, collagen type IV and fibronectin and that the remaining rounded and/or spindle-shaped, BT-A6A cells were also viable compared with growth in serum-free medium. Together, this suggests that AnxA6 expression in motile/invasive breast cancer cells is necessary for efficient attachment to specific extracellular matrix components.Reduced expression of AnxA6 inhibits the motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cellsMost invasive breast cancer cells express low levels of E-cadherin and grow in 3D cultures on matrigel as branched or stellate colonies while the weakly invasive or non-invasive cell lines retain E-cadherin expression and grow either as fused colonies or as spherical colonies. In the following assays MCF-10A cells were used as negative control and the galectin-3 expressing BT-549 (BT-Gal3) cells previously shown to be less motile but more invasive than the parental BT-549 cells were used as the positive control. We first examined the expression of AnxA6 and epithelial-mesenchymal markers in these cells by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5A, lane 1, MCF-10A cells are N-cadherin and AnxA6-negative but as expected are E-cadherin positive. While the parental BT-549 and BT-Gal3 cells express similar levels of AnxA6, we consistently detected N-cadherin in BT-A6A cells (Fig. 5A, lane 4). We next tested the ability of BT-A6A cells to grow in 3D cultures in growth factor-reduced matrigel. As shown in Fig. 5B, unlike the parental BT-549 cells and BT-Gal3 cells which grow as branched or stellate colonies as previously shown, BT-A6A cells grew as spherical colonies similar to MCF-10A acini. This confirmed that depletion of AnxA6 in BT-549 cells promoted anchorage-independent cell growth but also abolished their invasiveness at least in vitro (Fig. 5B, cf. BT-549 and BT-A6A).To ascertain whether AnxA6 depletion affected cellular motility and invasiveness, cells were seeded in thin membrane cell culture inserts with or without a thin layer of matrigel using complete DMEM/F12 (10% FBS) as the chemoattractant. Fig. 5C shows that BT-A6A cells exhibited reduced (at least 20 fold) motility compared to the parental BT-549 cells. As expected, MCF-10A cells were negligibly motile while the BT-Gal3 cells were about 5-fold less motile than the parental cells (Fig. 5C). Analysis of the invasive potentials of these cells revealed that BT-A6A cells were again at least 8-fold less invasive while the BT-Gal3 cells were slightly more invasive than the parental BT-549 cells (Fig. 5D). Together, this suggests that AnxA6 expression is necessary for the motile/invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells and that the over-expression of N-cadherin, AnxA2 or AnxA4 (Fig. 2) was not sufficient to rescue the cells from the loss of AnxA6.AnxA6 expression is important for the localization of focal adhesions at appropriate plasma membrane sitesFrom the preceding observations, we speculated that AnxA6 might affect the formation and/or maturation of adherens junctions and adhesion plaques at cell-cell and cell-ECM contact sites respectively. We first, examined the formation of these structures by immunofluorescence staining of vinculin in parental cells cultivated at various Ca2+ concentrations. Fig. 6A shows that parental BT-549 cells respond to an increase in extracellular Ca2+ by forming larger and more conspicuous adhesion plaques (arrow heads). To examine whether the reduced adhesion and motility of BT-A6A cells could be due to defective formation, localization and/or distribution of adhesion plaques, serum-starved cells were briefly treated with 2 mM Ca2+ and processed for visualization of vinculin-based adhesion plaques. As shown in Fig. 6B (arrow heads), the adhesion plaques in the parental BT-549 cells are conspicuous and peripherally located. In the spindle-shaped AnxA6-depleted cells these structures are not only fewer but are elongated, randomly distributed and concentrated at the tips of the cells (Fig. 6B, lower panel). A closer examination of the distribution of adhesion plaques at intercellular junctions (Fig. 6C, insets) in cells grown on glass cover slips in complete DMEM/F12 medium revealed discernible vinculin staining at intercellular junctions in the parental BT-549 cells (Fig. 6C, left panel). However, in BTA6A cells, the cell-cell contacts are not clearly demarcated by the vinculin structures (Fig. 6C, right panel). Together with data in Figs. 3, 4 and 5 this confirms that AnxA6 expression is required for the establishment of cell-cell cohesion as well as for cell-ECM interactions which are necessary for efficient motility and invasiveness of cancer cells.The Ca2+-dependent formation of adhesion plaques in BT-549 cells as shown in Fig. 6A prompted us to question whether the diminished cellular adhesion and motility following AnxA6 depletion could be due to defects in the generation of signals from focal adhesions. As shown in Fig. 7A, in the parental BT-549 cells and as expected, extracellular Ca2+ promoted the translocation of AnxA6 to membranes. To correlate the Ca2+-dependent formation of both adhesion plaques (Fig. 6A) and AnxA6 translocation to membranes with the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) known to be recruited to focal contacts, we investigated the effect of Ca2+ concentration on the autophosphorylation of FAK (phospho-Y397) in the parental BT-549 cells. Fig. 7B shows that the activation of FAK is indeed Ca2+-dependent; FAK autotophosphorylation is at least 3-fold at 5 mM Ca2+ compared to Ca2+-free conditions. We next, examined the effect of AnxA6 depletion on extracellular Ca2+-dependent activation of FAK, and the downstream signaling cascades involving PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathways. To do this parental BT-549 and BT-A6A cells were treated with or without the indicated concentrations of Ca2+ for 10 min and the autophosphorylation of FAK or the activation of Akt (phospho-S473) and ERK1/2 (phospho-ERK1/2) were examined by western blotting in the respective cell lysates. We show that the activation of ERK1/2 is Ca2+-dependent in the parental BT-549 cells. On the contrary, in BT-A6A cells the activity of ERK1/2 is not responsive to Ca2+ (Fig. 7C and D). As depicted in Fig. 7C we consistently observed at least 2-fold up-regulation of the total ERK2 levels. While, the activation of FAK in parental BT-549 cells is Ca2+-dependent, it is strongly inhibited in BT-A6A cells (Fig 7C and E). We also observed that while PI3 kinase (depicted by phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt on S473) is activated in the parental BT-549 cells but its activation in BT-A6A cells is also strongly inhibited (Fig 7C and F). Together with data in figure 3, this suggests that the enhanced anchorage-independent proliferation of AnxA6-depleted cells is dependent on the constitutive activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway while AnxA6-dependent cellular adhesion and motility to a large extent appears to be modulated via the formation and appropriate localization of functional focal adhesions and the activation of the FAK-PI3 kinase/Akt pathway.AnxA6 expression is critical during the invasive stages of breast cancerOur data on the growth of BT-A6A cells in 2D and 3D cultures (Figs. 3 and 5) revealed that AnxA6 is necessary for cell-cell cohesion and cell motility/invasiveness but its diminished expression promotes anchorage-independent cell proliferation. To correlate this with AnxA6 expression in breast cancer tissues, we examined its expression levels as well as the proliferative potential of cells in paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed normal breast, invasive ductal carcinoma and in mucous adenocarcinoma human breast tissues (US-Biomax Inc.). We show that AnxA6 expression is strongest in the ductal epithelial cells in normal mammary tissues; it is however, decreased to about 60% in invasive ductal carcinoma tissues and even more so (about 10%) in mucous adenocarcinoma tissues (Fig. 8A, upper panel and Fig. 8B). The immunohistochemical staining of PCNA revealed that while cell proliferation is barely detected in normal breast tissues, we observe more active proliferation in the invasive ductal carcinoma tissues (scored as 100%) and about 60% proliferation in mucous adenocarcinoma tissues (Fig. 8A, lower panel and Fig. 8B). Fig. 8C confirms that unlike MCF-10A, primary mammary epithelial cells (HuMEC) are AnxA6-positive. Expression of vinculin was not significantly different in the parental and AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells. Together, this demonstrates that although AnxA6 expression is reduced in breast cancer tissues, it remains relatively elevated in the invasive phenotype of breast cancer.DiscussionEarlier studies in our and other laboratories revealed that AnxA6 is a candidate receptor for fetuin-A on the surface of breast cancer cells and for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in several cell types. Since these extracellular AnxA6-interacting partners are potential cell adhesion molecules, AnxA6 may mediate the interaction of cells with these ECM components. On the other hand, the stabilization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton following constitutive membrane targeting of AnxA6 emphasizes the role of AnxA6 in cellular processes such as cell adhesion to the ECM and motility and perhaps their metastatic potentials. Another report that depletion of AnxA6 in the invasive MDA-MB-436 breast cancer cells promoted anchorage-independent cell proliferation suggested yet another notion that AnxA6 might function as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. The impetus for the present studies was therefore to address in greater detail this dichotomy in the role(s) of AnxA6 in breast cancer progression. Our data demonstrate that reduced AnxA6 expression contributes to breast cancer progression by promoting the loss of functional cell-cell and/or cell-ECM contacts and therefore enhanced anchorage-independent cell proliferation, presumably driven by sustained MAP kinase activation. Meanwhile, AnxA6-dependent cellular adhesion/motility may be driven by the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway due to the formation of functional focal adhesions at defined plasma membrane sites.Annexins are known to be intracellular proteins which efficiently interact with biological membranes. However, several proteomic studies have consistently identified AnxA2 and AnxA6 in cell-derived exosomes and on the surface of some cell types. It is believed that annexins reach the cell surface by translocating from the inner leaflet to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. There is also sufficient evidence that these signal peptide-less proteins associate with nanovesicles or multi-vesicular bodies and are released as exosomes. Our data show that these annexins are secreted by breast cancer cells via the exosomal pathway and that the secreted proteins are predominantly cell surface-associated. This more or less constitutive cell-surface association is supported by the fact that even at physiological Ca2+ concentrations (1.1-1.3 mM) extracellular annexins will almost entirely be membrane bound. The quantitative difference between cell surface expression of AnxA2 and AnxA6 in BT-549 and other cell types is not surprising because individual annexins require different Ca2+ concentrations for translocation to membranes and/or subsequent secretion in exosomes.Cell adhesion requires the interaction of cell surface receptors with their ECM ligands, followed by the clustering of adhesion receptors (cell spreading) and eventually the formation of adhesion plaques and actin stress fibers. Extracellular AnxA6 may influence this process through its interaction with extracellular ligands including the serum glycoprotein fetuin-A, chondroitin sulfate containing proteoglycans and as shown in this study, with the basement membrane collagen type IV. This receptor-ligand notion is supported by the demonstration that AnxA2 is the receptor for the matricellular protein tenascin-C as well as plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator. The interaction of AnxA2 with these ligands has been shown to affect cellular adhesion and migration. The interesting observation that AnxA6 might mediate the interaction of breast cancer cells with the basement membrane collagen type IV is indicative of a potential role of AnxA6 as a metastasis-promoting factor. If this is true, then AnxA6 may play an important role during the migration of invasive cancer cells into and out of the vasculature by enhancing the interaction of tumor cells with the basement membranes of the endothelium.The previous observation that AnxA6 expression is associated with divalent cation-dependent endothelial cell adhesion of metastatic RAW117 large-cell lymphoma cells suggests that cell surface AnxA6 may directly mediate celI-cell interactions. In support of this putative function, annexins have been shown to self-aggregate on membrane surfaces in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This possibly occurs via the formation of \u201cannexin bridges\u201d between adjacent cells via their conserved domains. It is possible that AnxA6 with two sets of 4 annexin repeats may be more efficient at forming such annexin bridges than either AnxA2 or other annexins with a single set of 4 annexin repeats. This again explains why in spite of over expression of AnxA2 and AnxA4 in AnxA6-depleted cells, the inhibition of cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions were not significantly overcome. This is supported by studies in which down regulation of AnxA1, AnxA2 or AnxA5 in various cancer cell types influenced cell motility via distinct mechanisms and suggests that these proteins are not functionally redundant.The motile phenotype of breast cancer cells is often associated with loss of E-cadherin and expression of N-cadherin. The surprising observation that N-cadherin is up-regulated in the adhesion and motility-impaired AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells support yet another idea that AnxA6 is required for cadherin function in cell-cell contacts. Although AnxA6 involvement remains to be verified, this possibility is consistent with a recent report in which AnxA2 was identified as a component of the vascular endothelial cell cadherin complex. It is worth noting that over-expression of N-cadherin in motility-impaired cells has also been reported in LN18 glioblastoma cells following transfection with a dominant negative HER2 receptor variant.Although other protein-AnxA6 interactions are possible, the demonstrated mode of association of AnxA6 with cell membranes is via membrane phospholipids. As such AnxA6 participates in the formation of membrane-cytoskeleton complexes and in a Ca2+-dependent manner. It should be recalled that focal contacts are actin-anchoring sites and recent studies confirmed that AnxA6 stabilizes the cortical actin cytoskeleton. This supports the notion that like extracellular AnxA6 discussed above, intracellular AnxA6 also acts as a link between the plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, although we could not demonstrate the presence of AnxA6 in focal contacts, it is possible that AnxA6 indirectly stabilizes focal contacts at appropriate plasma membrane locations via its interaction with F-actin. It is also likely that AnxA6 does not influence the formation of vinculin-based focal contacts per se, but loss of AnxA6 expression may prevent the anchoring of these structures at appropriate locations in the plasma membrane. The requirement of AnxA6 in this process is supported by the altered cellular morphology as well as the elongated structure and dispersed localization of adhesion plaques following AnxA6 depletion in BT-549 cells.This study enhances our understanding of two potential roles of AnxA6 in breast cancer progression viz. as a tumor suppressor and as a motility promoting factor. From our data it appears that in breast cancer, AnxA6 expression reduces as the disease progresses. Loss of AnxA6 has been linked with inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry, impaired membrane targeting of p120GAP which negatively regulates Ras activity and therefore, sustained activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway. This sustained activation of the MAP kinase pathway appears to be a major contributing factor in enhanced anchorage-independent proliferation of AnxA6-depleted cells and therefore, enhanced tumor growth. Cell adhesion and motility/invasion on the other hand depend upon efficient reorganization of the cytoskeleton and more precisely on the propensity for rapid assembly and disassembly of cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts. This has been shown to be driven by the FAK-dependent activation of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. Our data also reveal that the underlying cause for the inhibition of adhesion-related properties of AnxA6-depleted BT-549 cells is the inappropriate localization and/or functional integrity of focal contacts at sites of contact with the ECM and/or between cells. The defective focal contacts and the strong inhibition of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway suggest that AnxA6-dependent adhesion and motility of invasive breast cancer cells rely on the activation of the FAK-PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. Therefore, while reduced AnxA6 expression is necessary for enhanced tumor growth via anchorage-independent cell proliferation, AnxA6 expression is required for cellular adhesion, motility and invasiveness.Supplementary MaterialThis is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "title": "Investigations on Zinc Isotope Fractionation in Breast Cancer Tissue Using <i>in vitro</i> Cell Culture Uptake-Efflux Experiments.",
        "content": "Zinc (Zn) accumulates in breast cancer tumors compared to adjacent healthy tissue. Clinical samples of breast cancer tissue show light Zn isotopic compositions (\u03b4<sup66</supZn) relative to healthy tissue. The underlying mechanisms causing such effects are unknown. To investigate if the isotopic discrimination observed for <iin vivo</i breast cancer tissue samples can be reproduced <iin vitro</i, we report isotopic data for Zn uptake-efflux experiments using a human breast cancer cell line. MDA-MB-231 cell line was used as a model for triple receptor negative breast cancer.

Clinical samples of breast cancer tissue show light Zn isotopic compositions (\u03b466Zn) relative to healthy tissue. The underlying mechanisms causing such effects are unknown. To investigate if the isotopic discrimination observed for in vivo breast cancer tissue samples can be reproduced in vitro, we report isotopic data for Zn uptake-efflux experiments using a human breast cancer cell line. MDA-MB-231 cell line was used as a model for triple receptor negative breast cancer. We determined Zn isotope fractionation for Zn cell uptake (\u039466Znuptake) and cell efflux (\u039466Znefflux) using a drip-flow reactor to enable comparison with the in vivo environment. The MDA-MB-231 cell line analyses show Zn isotopic fractionations in an opposite direction to those observed for in vivo breast cancer tissue. Uptake of isotopically heavy Zn (\u039466Znuptake = +0.23 \u00b1 0.05\u2030) is consistent with transport via Zn transporters (ZIPs), which have histidine-rich binding sites. Zinc excreted during efflux is isotopically lighter than Zn taken up by the cells (\u039466Znefflux = \u22120.35 \u00b1 0.06\u2030). The difference in Zn isotope fractionation observed between in vitro MDA-MB-231 cell line experiments and in vivo breast tissues might be due to differences in Zn transporter levels or intercellular Zn storage (endoplasmic reticulum and/or Zn specific vesicles); stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and immune cells. Although, additional experiments using other human breast cancer cell lines (e.g., MCF-7, BT-20) with varying Zn protein characteristics are required, the results highlight differences between in vitro and in vivo Zn isotope fractionation.IntroductionOver the last decade analysis of natural metal isotopes has emerged as an interdisciplinary field of substantial biomedical potential, including diagnosis and defining disease mechanisms. Compared to metabolic studies where radioactive and single isotope tracers are used to monitor concentration changes, high precision measurements of natural isotopic fractionations are especially useful because they can inform on mechanisms, e.g., why changes in concentration occur due to altered uptake, secretion or excretion. Two recently published breast cancer studies found that Zn dyshomeostasis linked to carcinogenesis is reflected in enrichment of light Zn isotopes in malignant breast tissue compared to adjacent histologically healthy tissue.Zinc homeostasis in humans is maintained by multiple proteins which tightly regulate intracellular Zn concentrations. Among these proteins are influx-controlling Zn importers (SLC39A; ZIP1-ZIP14), efflux-controlling Zn transporters (SLC30A; ZnT1-ZnT10), and Zn-sequestering proteins (e.g., metallothionein) [e.g., ]. Histidine-, glutamate-, aspartate- and cysteine-residues serve as binding ligands for Zn in these proteins. In general, histidine-rich loops form the primary Zn-binding sites of ZIPs and ZnTs, while Zn-binding on metallothionein occurs on cysteine-rich ligands. Cancer-induced Zn dyshomeostasis has been related to up- or down-regulation of Zn proteins and changes in their coordination and ligand chemistry. For breast cancer, upregulation of ZIP6, ZIP7, ZIP10, ZnT2 and overexpression of metallothionein have been proposed to implicate higher Zn levels in malignant relative to healthy tissue.Isotopic fractionation of Zn isotopes in cells is linked to coordination chemistry. Lower atomic weight is associated with lower bond energy, so heavier isotopes are enriched in the strongest ligand bonds, assuming equilibrium isotope fractionation. Thus, cysteine (S-ligands) preferentially binds isotopically light Zn, while normally tighter binding histidine (N-ligands) and aspartate (O-ligands) preferentially complex isotopically heavy Zn. If the normal Zn-ligand binding environments are disturbed by Zn dyshomeostasis, isotopic compositions in various body reservoirs (e.g., blood, urine, tissue) can be perturbed. Thus, Zn isotope analysis of clinical samples could be a method to probe the role of Zn uptake and secretion in cancer development and progression.In vitro cell lines are powerful simplified models to study processes at the molecular and cellular levels including the study of cancer-induced isotopic fractionation. Various human cell lines have been used to better understand uptake and transport mechanisms causing isotope fractionation of copper, iron, uranium and Zn. Differentiated neuron-like cells (SH-SY5Y) preferentially incorporate and accumulate light isotopes of copper, uranium, and Zn. Similar observations have been made for differentiated intestinal (Caco-2) cells showing the preferential uptake of isotopically light iron. Under oxidative stress, however, cancerous liver cells incorporate copper that is isotopically heavy. These observations contradict the expected correlation between in vitro and in vivo studies on metal ion isotope fractionation.There is little information about the processes at the molecular and cellular level causing systematic enrichment of light Zn isotopes in malignant breast tissue. Our work aimed to improve the mechanistic understanding of the isotopic behavior of Zn in breast cancer, with the long-term objective of biomarker development. We conducted experiments using in vitro breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231) spiked with isotopically-natural Zn and determined the isotopic fractionation induced due to active uptake and efflux. The results highlight differences between in vitro and in vivo Zn isotope processing and will inform future studies on using Zn isotope fractionation as a biomarker (Figure 1).Schematic of overall approach for biomedical studies to investigate metal stable isotope fractionation.MethodsCell ProliferationThe cell proliferation experiments were conducted to investigate if isotopic mass controls cell growth. Isotopically enriched metal powders of 64Zn (>99.00 %) and 68Zn (>99.00 %) (Isoflex, San Francisco, CA, US) were dissolved separately in 6 M HCl. Chloride solutions were diluted with 18 M\u03a9 cm purified H2O (MilliQ) to make 10 mM ZnCl2 solutions which were then added to the exposure medium. The exposure medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal calf serum (FBS, Gibco Life, heat inactivated) + 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) + 10 mM ZnCl2 solution was combined, adjusted to pH 7.4 if necessary and then equilibrated overnight. This exposure medium was added over two passages of MDA-MB-231 cells to enable full isotopic equilibration. At a cell density of 1 \u00d7 105, cells were seeded in six well-plates (n = 4) for negative control (0 \u03bcM Zn, -ve), positive control (20 \u03bcM Zn, +ve), isotopically light (20 \u03bcM, 64Zn) and isotopically heavy (20 \u03bcM, 68Zn) exposures and grown under normal oxygen conditions. The cells were counted at 48, 72, and 96 h using a Cellometer Auto T4 (Nexcelom Bioscience, MA, US) to monitor the growth rate. To ensure constant cell proliferation the exposure media were refreshed after 48 h for the cells growing for 72 or 96 h.Uptake-Efflux ExperimentCell CulturingIn our uptake-efflux experiment, MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26) cells were first cultured under sterile conditions inside a class II biological safety cabinet at 37\u00b0C. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal calf serum (FBS, Gibco Life, heat inactivated) + 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) without Zn addition. After 48 h, the cells were transferred to petri dishes containing medium without additional Zn. At this step cells were grown on microscopic slides until they reached 105 cells/cm2. Microscopic slides with MDA-MB-231 were transferred to media spiked with 15 \u03bcM isotopically natural Zn solution. A concentration of 15 \u03bcM ZnCl2 was selected as it is within the reference range of intracellular and plasma homeostatic Zn (11\u201324 \u03bcM). As \u201cfree\u201d Zn is toxic to cells, even at nanomolar levels, we added Zn complexed with histidine (Zn-His), a stable octahedral compound. MDA-MB-231 cells on microscopic slides were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C before being transferred to the drip flow biofilm reactor for the efflux experiment.Efflux ExperimentFigure 2 shows the experimental setup for the efflux experiment using a drip flow-through biofilm reactor (BioSurface Technologies, Corp., USA). The experiment was conducted in a class II biological safety cabinet. Prior conducting the efflux experiment with a cell line, the setup was tested for Zn blanks using a 20 mM metal-free HEPES input solution. The polysulfone drip flow-through biofilm reactor has a 10\u00b0 inclination and consists of four chambers. The 20 mM metal-free HEPES input fluid was supplied through four channels imposed by a peristaltic pump and ran through the system for 1 and 2.5 h, respectively, and the effluent was collected separately for each channel.Schematic of the cell uptake-efflux experiment. A HEPES solution from the Tedlar bags is pumped to the drip flow-through reactor (1 ml min\u22121, as controlled by a peristaltic pump). The drip flow-through reactor contains 4 microscopic slides with MDA-MB-231 cells pre-grown in medium spiked with 15 \u03bcM Zn-histidine (Zn-His). Effluent samples were taken for 0.5 h in metal-free 50 mL centrifuge tubes.For the cell line efflux experiment, microscopic slides with cells cultured for 24 h in Zn-His spiked medium were washed three times with 20 mM metal-free HEPES solution before placed in the drip flow-through biofilm reactor to remove detached cells. This step ensured that the collected effluent solution of the efflux experiment only contained Zn excreted by the cells. The initial cell density and initial Zn isotope composition of these cells prior to the efflux experiments were determined by harvesting the cells from a microscopic slide with trypsin (Lonza). The harvested cells were counted using the Cellometer Auto T4 cell counter (Nexcelom, Bioscience). The 20 mM metal-free HEPES solution was directly dripped onto the cells with a rate of 1 ml min\u22121. Due to inclination of the drip flow-through reactor the residence time of the fluid passing the chambers was extremely short (<1 min) resulting in short contact time of the fluid and the cells. The effluent was collected in 30 min intervals in acid-washed metal-free centrifuge tubes (VWR). After the experiment, the cells on the microscopic slides were harvested using trypsin. Harvested cells, effluent and aliquots of the medium, and starting input HEPES solution were stored at \u221220\u00b0C, until required.Prior to isotope analysis, harvested cells were lysed using a MARS 5 Digestion Microwave System (CEM Corp., UK). The harvested cell suspension was transferred in acid cleaned XP-1500 Plus (PTFE) vessels and 3 ml of quartz sub-boiled distilled nitric acid (15.4 N) and 2 ml hydrogen peroxide (Romil Ltd) were added. A blank sample consisting of only 3 ml of nitric acid and 2 ml hydrogen peroxide was processed for quality control. The samples were pre-digested at room temperature overnight. Microwave-assisted acid digestion was performed by ramping up the temperature stepwise to 210\u00b0C and 250 psi over 60 min, and held there for 30 min to ensure complete digestion.For Zn isotope analysis, all samples (e.g., acid-digested cells, efflux solution) were double-spiked consisting of mixture of 64Zn and 67Zn. The double-spike mixture had a 64Zn/67Zn = 4.2336 and was added to each sample in an ideal sample/spike mixture of 1. To ensure the ideal sample/spike mixture, a small sample aliquot (20 \u03bcl) was spiked with an appropriate volume of 64Zn + 67Zn spike and the sample Zn concentration was determined by isotope dilution. Once sample-Zn was known, a larger aliquot of the sample was prepared for Zn isotopic analysis. Zinc was separated and purified using AG-MP1 resin (BioRad, 100\u2013200 mesh) following the method described by. The Zn columns with 250 \u03bcl AG-MP1 resin were rinsed with 10 mL of each 0.1N HNO3 and double-deionized water, conditioned with 6N HCl, and equilibrated with 4 x 0.5 ml 1N HCl. The spiked sample re-dissolved in 1 ml 1N HCl was loaded on the column and subsequently rinsed with 8 mL of 1N HCl. In the last step, 6 mL of 0.01N HCl was added to elute Zn from the column. Procedural blanks and Zn standard solutions (IRMM-3702, London-Zn) were processed in the same way as samples. The Zn isotope ratios and precise elemental Zn concentrations were measured with Nu Plasma HR-multiple-collector ICP-MS by double-spike and sample-standard bracketing techniques. All Zn isotope values were expressed as delta notation [\u03b466Zn (\u2030)] relative to the JMC-Lyon:The extent of isotope fractionation was determined and described as:where \u039466Znuptake reflects Zn isotope fractionation for Zn taken up by cells (\u03b466Zncells) from Zn-His spiked medium (\u03b466Znmedium) after incubation for 24 h, and Zn isotope fractionation of the efflux (\u039466Znefflux) is described as:based on the difference between Zn isotopic composition of cells after incubation for 24 h (\u03b466Zncells) and the Zn isotopic composition of the effluent (\u03b466Zneffluent) collected for 0.5 h.The in-house London Zn was used as standard for sample-standard bracketing and the precision of the unprocessed London Zn solution was \u00b1 0.04\u2030 (n = 26) over two analytical days. The precision of \u03b466Zn for processed pure Zn IRMM-3702 reference material was \u22120.13 \u00b1 0.08\u2030 (2SD, n = 6). If not stated otherwise, the precision of 2SD for \u03b466Zn (\u2030) refers to repeated analysis of London Zn bracketing standards.ResultsZinc Isotope Enrichment Proliferation TestsFigure 3 shows the average cell growth of MDA-MB-231 in a 64Zn and 68Zn isotope enriched medium as well as the control without Zn (-ve) and natural Zn (+ve). In all experiments, regardless of the isotopic composition of the Zn in solution, the cell density increased by 5-fold within 96 h reaching an average density of 5.3 \u00d7 105 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 105 cells. If cell growth is driven by the mass of an isotope, we would expect to see faster growth for the lighter isotopes compared t the heavier isotopes of Zn (Figure 3 and Table 1).Zinc isotope enrichment proliferation after 96 h under different medium Zn conditions: -ve control = negative control without Zn; +ve control = positive control with 20 \u03bcM \u201cnatural\u201d Zn; 64-Zinc = 20 \u03bcM 64Zn and 68-Zinc = 20\u03bcM 68Zn only.Data summary for Zn isotope enrichment proliferation tests.Experimentalcondition\tTime(hrs)\tAverage(x105 cells)\tStdev(x105 cells)\t \t-ve control\t0\t1.00\t\u2013\t \t-ve control\t48\t1.82\t0.66\t \t-ve control\t72\t3.30\t0.93\t \t-ve control\t96\t5.94\t1.49\t \t+ve control\t0\t1.00\t\u2013\t \t+ve control\t48\t1.42\t0.40\t \t+ve control\t72\t3.39\t1.74\t \t+ve control\t96\t5.20\t0.79\t \t64Zn\t0\t1.00\t\u2013\t \t64Zn\t48\t1.86\t0.05\t \t64Zn\t72\t3.21\t0.99\t \t64Zn\t96\t5.35\t1.61\t \t68Zn\t0\t1.00\t\u2013\t \t68Zn\t48\t0.93\t0.54\t \t68Zn\t72\t2.98\t1.62\t \t68Zn\t96\t4.60\t1.68\t \t-ve control\t96\t5.94\t1.49\t \t+ve control\t96\t5.20\t0.79\t \t64Zn\t96\t5.35\t1.61\t \t68Zn\t96\t4.60\t1.68\t \tCell EffluxControl of blank levels. We assessed blank contributions because Zn usually has a high background level, which can significantly alter the measured isotopic composition. The microwave control blank was 0.9 ng Zn ml\u22121 and procedural blanks for the anion exchange chromatography were 0.24 \u00b1 0.20 ng Zn ml\u22121 (n = 4). The Zn blank for the experimental setup ranged between 0.5 and 2.7 ng Zn ml\u22121 after 1 h effluent collection and decreased to 0.6\u20131.4 ng Zn ml\u22121 after 2.5 h (Table 2). This corresponds to 0.7\u20134.8% of Zn (mean: 1.9 \u00b1 2.0% Zn) collected in the effluent of the cell line efflux experiment. The sum of all blanks (microwave, procedural and efflux) corresponds to 0.008 and 0.81% of the initial Zn in medium and harvested cells before the efflux experiment. This observation demonstrates that precise and reliable Zn isotope data can be achieved for cell line experiments using the drip flow-through biofilm reactor.Data summary for uptake-efflux experiment.Experiment\tSampletype\tTime(h)\tFlow reactorchannel\tZn concentration(ng/ml)\t% Zn rel.efflux\tNumber ofanalysis\t \tBlank test\tFluid\t1\t1\tNA\t\t\u2013\t \t\tFluid\t1\t2\t0.48\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t1\t3\t2.09\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t1\t4\t2.66\t\t1\t \tBlank test\tFluid\t2.5\t1\t0.68\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t2.5\t2\t1.38\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t2.5\t3\t0.55\t\t1\t \t\tFluid\t2.5\t4\tNA\t\t\u2013\t \tExperiment\tSample type\tTime (h)\tFlow reactor channel\tZn concentration(ng/ml)\t\u03b466ZnIRMM3702(\u2030)\tNumber of analysis\t \tEfflux\tFluid\t0.5\t1\t105\t\u22120.19 (0.05)\t1\t \t\tFluid\t0.5\t2\t40\t\u22120.07 (0.04)\t1\t \t\tFluid\t0.5\t3\t70\t\u22120.11 (0.05)\t1\t \t\tFluid\t0.5\t4\t55\tNA\t1\t \tInitial Zn medium\tFluid\t0\t\t\t\u22120.03 (0.07)\t2\t \tCells before efflux\tSolid\t\u2013\t\t302\t+0.2 (0.07)\t1\t \tIRMM-3702 (processed)\t\t\t\t\t\u22120.13 (0.08)\t6\t \tMass balance. Our current experimental design does not allow for a complete isotopic mass balance. Cellular concentrations and isotopic changes of Zn can only be monitored assuming a similar distribution and behavior of cells on each microscopic slide. Based on the Zn concentration of harvested cells from two microscopic slides, we calculated that about 0.15% of total 15 \u03bcM Zn from the medium was incorporated into MDA-MB-231 cells. With an initial MDA-MB-231 cell density of 2.6 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 0.62 \u00d7 106 cells (n = 2), the Zn uptake yielded in 8.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 nM Zn/cell (= accounting for 5.4 \u00d7 109 Zn atoms/cell). The initial medium spiked with isotopic naturally-distributed 15 \u03bcM Zn-His had a \u03b466Zn of \u22120.03 \u00b1 0.02\u2030 (2 SD, n = 2). MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 15 \u03bcM Zn-His had a \u25b366Zn of +0.20\u2030 prior to the efflux experiment. The intracellular Zn of MDA-MB-231 is isotopically heavier compared to the initial medium (\u039466Znuptake = +0.23 \u00b1 0.1\u2030; 2SD, Figure 4). Zinc in the effluent collected from four channels corresponds to 4.03 \u00b1 1.66 \u00d7 10\u22127 nM Zn/cell (= accounting for 2.4 \u00d7 108 Zn atoms/cell). The \u03b466Zn of the efflux solutions collected from the four channels range between \u22120.07 and \u22120.19\u2030 with an average of \u22120.12 \u00b1 0.12\u2030 (2 SD).Possible pathways that may lead to Zn isotope fractionation (\u039466Zn) based on the uptake-efflux experiment with the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Zn was provided as Zn complexed with histidine (Zn-His). Zn isotope fractionation by cell uptake (\u039466Znuptake) can be caused by (1) active import of Zn-His via Zn importer proteins (ZIP) or (2) non-quantitative diffusion of Zn via unspecified channels. Zn isotope fractionation via efflux (\u039466Znefflux) of Zn out of the cells can be caused by (1) active export of Zn-His via Zn transporter proteins (ZnT) or (2) non-quantitative diffusion of Zn via unspecified channels.DiscussionThe results show nearly identical proliferation of MDA-MB-231 under single isotope and natural Zn exposure conditions; these observations demonstrate that isotopic mass does not control cell growth. The addition of 20 \u03bcM Zn did not enhance or suppress the proliferation, as the cell density for light (64Zn) or heavy (68Zn) isotopically spiked Zn conditions are similar to those for the no-Zn control and Zn with natural isotope composition (Figure 3).Metabolism in cancerous breast tissue is generally thought to be enhanced in order to provide sufficient energy and anabolic substrate for proliferation. Adaptation in Zn-protein expression in neoplasms is not driven by preferential uptake of any Zn isotopologue. This means that the isotopic shift reported in breast tumors likely reflects metabolic changes for Zn in cancerous breast cells, and not an energetic advantage related to the isotopic composition possessed by the neoplasm. As such, observed isotopic shifts in breast cancer tissue can be used purely as a monitor of neoplastic driven metabolic changes. Furthermore, single stable isotope tracer studies are established as providing better insight into the processes under investigation without inducing or exacerbating pathological processes.Notably, our MDA-MB-231 cell line analyses show isotopic fractionations in the opposite direction to those determined for in vivo breast cancer tissue samples. Malignant breast tumors have significantly lower \u03b466Zn than healthy tissues which has been interpreted as an indicator for increased metallothionein expression. The difference in Zn isotope fractionation observed between in vitro MDA-MB-231 cell line experiments and in vivo breast tissue might be due to differences in Zn transporter levels or intercellular Zn storage mechanisms (e.g., metallothionein expression).A positive direction of Zn isotope fractionation for the cell uptake (\u039466Znuptake = +0.23 \u00b1 0.1\u2030, 2SD, n = 2) can be mechanistically explained by Zn adsorption, diffusion through non-selective channels into the cell or an active cell uptake via ZIP proteins. Adsorption studies on bacterial cells and biofilms show preferential binding of heavy Zn isotopes with equilibrium isotopic fractionation between +0.50 and +1.30\u2030. However, adsorption may be less likely in our studies as the 2:1 Zn (His)2 complexes are uncharged and cells were rinsed with metal-free HEPES to remove any loosely adsorbed Zn. Instead, the preferential uptake of 66Zn by MDA-MB-231 may reflect previously reported upregulation of histidine-rich ZIPs in breast cancer cells. ZIP proteins (ZIP1-ZIP14) control intracellular Zn levels by transporting Zn into the cells across the cell membrane. Upregulation of ZIPs has been observed in most cancers to meet the demand of increased rate of proliferation and metabolism. An indicator for ZIP upregulation is one-order of magnitude higher Zn uptake of 5.4 \u00d7 109 Zn atoms/cells by MDA-MB-231 in our experiments compared to Zn required by mammalian cells (108 Zn atoms/cell).Zinc isotope fractionation for Zn uptake by cells can be associated with Zn speciation, Zn-binding domains of proteins or exchange reactions. A study with neuron-like cells showed a preferential uptake of light 64Zn with an isotopic fractionation of 1.14\u2030. However, uptake and efflux of Zn-His should not fractionate Zn isotopes due to a lack in coordination change for complexed Zn species. Caldelas and Weiss, however, argued that non-quantitative uptake of complexed Zn can result in an enrichment of 66Zn in plant cells. We can assume a similar isotopic effects of non-quantitative uptake for Zn-His because only 0.15% of Zn from the medium has been taken up by MDA-MB-231 cells. However, our data cannot directly resolve whether diffusion through non-selective channels or uptake via ZIPs, or other proteins, is the predominant pathway for Zn uptake by MDA-MB-231 cells.Negative \u039466Znefflux suggests diffusion via non-selective channels. During diffusion light 64Zn diffuses faster out of the cell than 66Zn. The efflux experiment shows that MDA-MB-231 cells preferentially 'excrete' light 64Zn with \u039466Znefflux of \u22120.42 \u00b1 0.12\u2030 (Figure 4). An existing concentration gradient with high Zn in cells and no Zn in the efflux solution may allow diffusion of Zn-His via non-selective channels. Coutaud et al. reported preferential excretion of lighter Zn isotopes with \u039466Zn of \u22120.50 \u00b1 0.20\u2030 due to desorption from the biofilm. Also, lighter Zn isotopes can diffuse faster through biological membranes or due to a gradient within the boundary layer. This leaves the cell culture enriched in heavy 66Zn over time resulting in opposite isotopic signal of what has been observed for in vivo malignant breast tissue. These in vivo studies found that Zn isotope compositions are about 0.17\u2030 lower in malignant breast than healthy tissues.The ZnTs family (ZnT1-ZnT10) regulates intracellular Zn levels by transporting Zn from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space. To decrease the toxic effects of high Zn in breast cancer cells, ZnT1 is overexpressed to prevent apoptotic cell death and increase Zn secretion. Wang et al. observed that the mRNA expression level of ZnT-1 increases significantly in MDA-MB-231 cells when they are exposed to Zn sulfate. In vivo, ZnTs transport only free Zn2+ across cell membranes and with that most likely isotopically heavy Zn2+ out of the cell due to their histidine-rich structure. In our experiments, however, Zn-His might be able to pass cell membranes via different channels and the diffusion out of the cell is similar to Zn-His uptake. This explains the preferential efflux of light 64Zn due to faster diffusion of light 64Zn. Obviously conducting an uptake-efflux experiment with free Zn2+ could be a better approach, but even if Zn is added to the medium as free Zn2+, culture medium contains millimolar levels of ligands (e.g., histidine, cysteine and phosphate) which rapidly complex free Zn2+. Moreover, conducting an experiment with \u201cfree\u201d Zn can result in apoptosis because \u201cfree\u201d Zn is a cell toxin at even nanomolar levels.In vivo, tumors are heterogenous, have a three-dimensional shape and are often mixed with connective tissue, immune cells, and stromal tissues. More specifically, breast cancer varies in its origin and genetic lesions, leading to distinct phenotypes which is also reflected in different ZIP and ZnT expression between various breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, we tested our findings from MDA-MB-231 in a large panel of breast cancer cell lines to further our understanding in cell lines representing patient subtypes (Table 3). Using a well-defined list of human ZnT and ZIP proteins, we identified ten Zn proteins which are differentially expressed (FDR-adjusted P < 0.1) in MDA-MB-231 compared to other basal-like breast cancer cell lines (e.g., Her2, Luminal A and Luminal B) (Table 3). It shows that more ZIPs and ZnTs are up- than downregulated which might explain the high uptake and efflux. Other studies on the hormone-dependent breast cancer cell lines T-47D and MCF-7 showed that ZnT2 and metallothionein are overexpressed, providing protection from Zn hyperaccumulation and preventing apoptosis by either removing Zn from the cell or redistributing it among cellular compartments. Consequently, whether breast cancer cell lines and the experimental approach with initially ligand complexed Zn (Zn-His) reflect that of in vivo carcinoma remains an important issue to resolve before drawing any reliable conclusion on Zn isotope fractionation in clinical samples.Differential gene expression analysis for ZnTs and ZIPs between the basal-like (including MDA-MB-231) and other breast cancer cell lines (Her2, Luminal A and Luminal B).Protein codinggene\tProteins\tlogFC\tP-value\tQ-value\tDirectionof expression\t \tSLC39A6\tZIP6\t\u22121.172\t0.001\t0.007\tDown\t \tSLC39A9\tZIP9\t\u22120.521\t0.000\t0.001\tDown\t \tSLC39A11\tZIP11\t\u22120.899\t0.000\t0.003\tDown\t \tSLC30A9\tZnT9\t\u22120.318\t0.036\t0.095\tDown\t \tSLC39A4\tZIP4\t0.899\t0.012\t0.041\tUp\t \tSLC39A8\tZIP8\t0.952\t0.010\t0.040\tUp\t \tSLC39A10\tZIP10\t0.430\t0.040\t0.095\tUp\t \tSLC39A14\tZIP14\t0.938\t0.010\t0.040\tUp\t \tSLC30A3\tZnT3\t0.769\t0.006\t0.033\tUp\t \tSLC30A6\tZnT6\t0.243\t0.036\t0.095\tUp\t \tSLC30A5\tZnT5\t\u22120.226\t0.068\t0.148\tNormal\t \tSLC30A10\tZnT10\t0.113\t0.079\t0.158\tNormal\t \tSLC39A12\tZIP12\t0.021\t0.137\t0.254\tNormal\t \tSLC39A2\tZIP2\t0.373\t0.153\t0.262\tNormal\t \tSLC30A4\tZnT4\t\u22120.207\t0.320\t0.510\tNormal\t \tSLC39A7\tZIP7\t\u22120.164\t0.356\t0.510\tNormal\t \tSLC39A1\tZIP1\t\u22120.162\t0.361\t0.510\tNormal\t \tSLC39A13\tZIP13\t\u22120.194\t0.419\t0.558\tNormal\t \tSLC30A8\tZnT8\t0.146\t0.522\t0.659\tNormal\t \tSLC30A2\tZnT2\t0.095\t0.555\t0.667\tNormal\t \tSLC39A5\tZIP5\t\u22120.027\t0.653\t0.706\tNormal\t \tSLC30A7\tZnT7\t0.062\t0.687\t0.706\tNormal\t \tSLC39A3\tZIP3\t0.061\t0.701\t0.706\tNormal\t \tSLC30A1\tZnT1\t0.081\t0.706\t0.706\tNormal\t \tFC, fold change; For each gene, log2FC was calculated as the difference in means of mRNA abundance between the basal-like and other cell lines.

Blue: Downregulated ZnTs and ZIPs in MDA-MB-23 relative to other basal-like breast cancer cell lines. Green: Upregulated ZnTs and ZIPs in MDA-MB-23 relative to other basal-like breast cancer cell lines.Future DirectionsOur results support the relevance of in vitro cell culture models to identify and understand factors driving changes in Zn isotopic composition caused by cancer development and progression. However, with respect to in vivo relevance, the results should be regarded as preliminary, and additional experiments are required using other human breast cancer cell lines, e.g., MCF-7, BT-20, with different expressions of ZnT and ZIP (Table 1). This is important, because, for instance, upregulation of ZIP6 in estrogen treated MCF-7 (Table 1) might lead to more pronounced uptake of heavy 66Zn. As almost every cancer is unique, it may be advantageous to determine average Zn isotope fractionation for cancer cells based on Zn biology (e.g., MT expression, ZnT and ZIP regulation, cell growth rate) moreover the use of 3D cell cultures as spheroids may be a representative approach and enable other stromal cell types to be incorporated into the workstream.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Author ContributionsKS and FL designed the experiments.

This pathway may present therapeutic opportunities to inhibit CAF-induced cancer progression.BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide among women, and nearly 2.3 million females are newly diagnosed annually. Although there are initial responses to treatment, many cancers relapse and distant metastases occur in nearly one-third of woman; these are typically fatal. The biology behind BC metastases still remains undetermined. Therefore, understanding molecular determinants of metastasis is crucial for finding new therapeutic strategies. The tumour microenvironment consists of immune cells, blood vessels, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and extracellular matrix. This microenvironment plays key roles in disease outcome by inducing tumour cell proliferation and aggressiveness. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), an activated form of tissue-resident fibroblasts present within breast cancers, comprise a major component of the tumour microenvironment, characterised most commonly by expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. CAFs can induce cancer progression and metastasis by secreting various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (e.g., VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12, IL6 and IL8) and by modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) that facilitates tumour cell migration and invasion. CAFs also modulate immune cell function to create an immune-suppressive environment during cancer progression. The process of transformation of CAFs from resident normal fibroblasts is achieved by several growth factors, however, the mechanisms of transformation have not yet been fully explored and may represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention; interestingly, once transformed into CAFs, the CAF phenotype has been regarded as stable, probably though maintenance of epigenetic changes.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3\u2032untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) of target genes, leading to post-transcriptional downregulation. MiRNAs can be oncogenic or act as tumour suppressors, depending upon the specific genes that they regulate. Dysregulation of miRNAs within the fibroblast component of breast cancer has been reported, and is therefore implicated in induction or maintenance of the CAF phenotype. For example, differential expression between breast CAFs and normal fibroblasts has been reported for many miRNAs, including miR-221, miR-31, miR-205, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-107, miR-30b, the let-7 family and miR-26b, although there is relatively little consistency between reports. Far fewer miRNAs have been shown experimentally to have functional impacts on the breast CAF phenotype, or most interestingly indirectly on cancer cell behaviour; examples include miR-26b, let-7b, miR-200 family and miR-29b. Although some of these studies have indicated functional roles for specific miRNAs within CAFs, very few studies have directly investigated miRNA roles on the transformation and maintenance of CAF phenotypes and on how this impacts on cancer behaviour, therefore how miRNAs in CAFs are involved in cancer progression remains poorly understood. Here, we have focussed on miR-222 as a candidate regulator of CAF phenotypes and cancer behaviour. MiR-222 has previously been reported as an oncogenic miRNA in various cancers, including BC, functioning within the cancer cells themselves, as opposed to stromal cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that upregulation of miR-222 induced growth of cancer cells by targeting p27/kip1, as well as chemoresistance by targeting PTEN/Akt. Interestingly, in the context of our study on function in fibroblasts, levels of miR-222 positively correlated with fibroblast viability in hypertrophic scar tissues, while miR-222 has been shown to induce replicative senescence in human lung fibroblasts. However, to date, no studies have been published on roles of miR-222 in CAFs. Therefore, the above observations suggest the importance of miR-222 as a post-transcriptional modifier, playing functional roles in BC progression. However, it is unclear whether expression of miR-222 is only tumour cell specific or the other cells also express miR-222 in tumour microenvironment. As miR-222 is an important oncogenic factor in breast cancer, we wanted to unveil whether CAFs also expressed miR-222 to influence disease progression.Materials and methodsReagentsFoetal bovine serum (FBS), DMEM and antibiotic/antimycotic (100X; 10,000\u2009units/mL penicillin, 10,000\u2009\u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 25\u2009\u00b5g/mL amphotericin B) were purchased from ThermoFisher (MA, USA).

KpnI, XbaI, PmeI, NotI and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (MA, USA).Ethical issues and cell cultureEthical approval for collection and use of human tissue was obtained from the Leeds East REC (references 06/Q1206/180, 09/H1306/108), and also from the Ethical Committee, Medical College, Kolkata, references MC/KOL/IEC/NON-SPON/102/09-2015. Fresh samples of surgically removed breast cancer samples were minced, digested with collagenase IV from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd (Mumbai, India) and plated (collagenase I coated) to derive primary breast CAFs (from within tumour masses) and NFs (from\u2009>\u20091\u2009cm outside tumour margins). Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were obtained from the ATCC (VA, USA). The NF and CAF fibroblast lines were derived from breast cancer samples and immortalised using lentiviral transduction of hTERT, as previously described. All cell lines were cultured in the DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics in a humid atmosphere incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C. NFs were transfected with scrambled siRNA negative control (NC), siLBR, miR-222 mimic or mimic control using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher; MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Similarly, CAFs were transfected with scramble negative control, miR-222 inhibitor, pCDNA or pCDNA-LBR. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested for western blotting, qRT-PCR analyses, senescence studies or migration/invasion studies. To collect NF and CAF conditioned medium, cells were seeded into six-well plates at 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/well. As previously described, cells were transfected as appropriate for 24\u2009h, then medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. After 48 and 72\u2009h of incubation, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 150\u2009g for 5\u2009min, and then the supernatant was collected.RNA isolation and qPCRMiR-222 is upregulated in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and controls breast fibroblast phenotype. a MiR-222 expression was determined by qPCR, and is shown for CAFs relative to NFs in three separate cell types. Left plot: matched pairs of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs were isolated from breast cancer patient samples using laser microdissection of archival (fixed) tissue. The data represent technical triplicates. Middle plot: four matched pairs of primary cultured CAFs and NFs from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. The data represent technical triplicates. Right plot: immortalised breast CAF and NF cell lines. The data represent biological triplicates. b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and miR-222 expression was assessed using qPCR. Data represent biological triplicates. c Relative gene expression levels of the CAF markers, \u03b1-SMA, Fibroblast Specific Protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were assessed in immortalised CAFs as compared with immortalised NFs using qPCR. The data represent biological triplicates. d Relative expression levels of the same CAF markers were assessed using qPCR in NFs (left) or CAFs (right) transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC). The data represent biological triplicates. e NFs or CAFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and protein expression of the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA (ACTA2) and vimentin were assessed using Western blots, along with \u03b2-actin as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005For LMD samples, the total RNA was extracted from using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols, or the mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). RNA was reverse-transcribed for miR-222 using the TaqMan MicroRNA RT kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and the resulting first strand was amplified using specific Taqman miRNA assay primers (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). The PCRs were performed by StepOne plus detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and amplification data were normalised using RNU6 expression. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. For cultured primary fibroblasts (in Fig.\u00a01b), RNA was isolated from a 90-mm dish of cultured cells using TRIzol (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instruction and RNA quantified by MULTISCANGO (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). For miRNA expression status and gene expression status, first strand cDNA and cDNA were synthesised with miScript RT-II kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Superscript III (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), respectively. MiR-222 expression was analysed using PCR starter kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); U6 was used as an endogenous control. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) on StepOne detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Expression was normalised to the house-keeping gene 18S.Protein extraction and western blotsCells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer System (lysis buffer pH 7.4, 200\u2009mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail,\u00a0100\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate) (Santa Cruz-sc24948). The lysates were centrifuged at 12700\u2009g for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u02daC. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) then transferred to the PVDF membranes (Millipore) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk. The membrane was then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Protein bands were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India). Bands were visualised using ECL.Histology, laser capture microdissection (LMD) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)LMD was carried out on the Zeiss PALM Laser Capture Microdissection Microscope exactly as described previously. In brief, archival FFPE cancer blocks and matched normal blocks were obtained and sectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm onto Membrane Slides NF 1.0 PEN (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). A guide section was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a histopathologist (LMW) to identify areas of fibroblasts with very few admixed inflammatory cells, epithelial cells or necrosis. The equivalent areas were then identified on other sections, and these were collected with the laser into lids of AdhesiveCap500 opaque PCR Tubes (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) by laser pressure catapulting (LPC). The microscope settings used for LCM were cut energy 71, focus 65, LPC energy 100, focus 65 at \u00d7100 magnification. Areas dissected from each case varied between 5.2 and 27.4\u00d7106\u2009\u03bcm2 depending on fibroblast density. For IHC, FFPE human breast cancer resection tissue was available; cancerous and non-cancerous breast tissue were immunostained for \u03b1-SMA and LBR. The signal was amplified and visualised with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen, followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin.Luciferase reporter assaysLamin B Receptor (LBR) is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts and is downregulated in breast CAFs relative to matched NFs. a LBR was identified as a potential miR-222 target by bioinformatics. The potential miR-222-binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is shown (WT), along with a binding-dead mutant used experimentally (MUT). b Luciferase reporters were cloned that allow expression of luciferase transcripts containing the wild-type or mutant LBR miR-222 3\u2032UTR binding sites. These were transfected into NFs (left) or CAFs (right) along with either miR-222 mimic or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC), and relative luciferase activity was determined. The data represent two biological replicates. c, d NFs or CAFs were transfected as shown, and the relative expression of endogenous LBR was determined using qPCR (c) or western blots (d). qPCR data represent three biological replicates. e Representative matched pair of normal and breast cancer tissues was assessed for expression of LBR by immunohistochemistry (\u00d710 and \u00d720 magnification). Brown staining represents expression of the target protein, while pink is a counterstain. f Relative expression of LBR was assessed in eight pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour. The data represent technical triplicates. g Protein expression levels of LBR, and the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA and vimentin were assessed by western blotting in three pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05The potential miR-222 binding sequence from the LBR gene (WT LBR) and three nucleotide-mutated LBR (MUT LBR) (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned into pMiRGLO (Promega, WI, USA) under restriction sites PmeI and XbaI (primers listed in Table\u00a0S1). Luciferase activities were measured 48\u2009h after transfection using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assays (Promega, WI, USA).Cell proliferation assaysNFs and CAFs were seeded in 96-well plates at 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well and transfected the following day. Cell proliferation was monitored after 72\u2009h by MTT (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). In total, 10\u2009\u00b5l of MTT solution (10\u2009mg/ml) in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMEM media was added per well. After 4\u2009h of incubation, formazan complexes were dissolved in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMSO, and signals were measured using MULTISCANGO plate reader (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). To evaluate the effects of conditioned media, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were seeded in 96-well plates at 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, condition media was applied. MTT assays were performed at 48\u2009h as above.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion ability were determined by Corning transwell insert chambers (8-\u00b5m pores; Corning, MA, USA) and Matrigel (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) coated in a transwell chamber for invasion analysis. Conditional media from different treatment conditions were used in lower chambers for migration and invasion study. The cells were prior treated with conditional media for 48\u2009h. In total, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 were added into chambers and incubated for 28\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells that had migrated or invaded were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, imaged and counted manually.Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) assaysSA-\u03b2-gal activity was detected by \u03b2-gal staining kit (Cell Signaling Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells containing blue stain were counted manually as positive senescent cells, and images were taken under phase contrast.Cell immunostaining and confocal microscopyNFs and CAFs were allowed to attach to glass coverslips overnight at 37\u2009\u02daC.

To investigate roles of miR-222 dysregulation in CAF biology, we first assessed relative expression of miR-222 in 14 matched pairs of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that have been isolated from breast cancer resection samples using laser microdissection (LMD). We found miR-222 to be upregulated in CAFs relative to matched NFs in 11 out of 14 cases, representing significant upregulation overall by a mean fold of 3.63 (p\u2009<\u20090.04; Fig.\u00a01a, left plot). To expand this finding, we further assessed miR-222 expression in four matched pairs of primary human breast NFs and CAFs cultures extracted from breast cancer resections; we found a greater than twofold induction of miR-222 in CAFs as compared with matched NFs in all cases (Fig.\u00a01a, middle plot). Finally, miR-222 expression in immortalised human breast NFs was compared with immortalised human breast CAFs; this also showed higher expression of miR-222 in CAFs by more than threefold (Fig.\u00a01a, right plot). We concluded that miR-222 is more highly expressed in CAFs than NFs in breast tissue.To explore functional roles of miR-222 in transformation of NFs to CAFs, we conducted a series of experiments on immortalised human breast NFs or immortalised human breast CAFs using miR-222 mimics to upregulate expression in NFs, or miR-222 inhibitors to downregulate expression in CAFs. First, miR-222 expression was assessed using qRT-PCR to confirm appropriate over- or under-expression (Fig.\u00a01b); miR-222 was significantly overexpressed by more than eightfold and was knocked down to one-third of its original level. Next, the relatively \u201cnormal\u201d or CAF-like phenotypes of these cell lines were characterised to establish their baselines for subsequent analyses. Expression of a range of classical CAF markers was assessed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a01c), immunofluorescence or western blotting (Fig.\u00a0S1). Relative expressions of ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin), FSP, CCL2 and VEGF were all substantially higher in CAFs as compared with NFs (a minimum of fivefold higher as assessed by qRT-PCR), as indicative of the CAF phenotype. Upregulation in CAFs of ACTA2/smooth muscle actin and vimentin was also confirmed at the protein level (Fig.\u00a0S1). Next, NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control mimics, and CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or control inhibitors, and miR-222\u2032s influence on transformation of NFs to CAFs, or on maintenance of the CAF phenotype was examined using the same panel of CAF markers as previously. Transfection of miR-222 mimics in NFs resulted in significant upregulation of all the CAF markers (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, left plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). Furthermore, downregulation of miR-222 in CAFs using miR-222 inhibitors significantly downregulated expression of the CAF markers, with the notable and surprising exception of CCL2 (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, right plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). We concluded that miR-222 levels play key roles in controlling the CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.LBR is a direct target of miR-222To investigate potential mechanisms by which miR-222 plays roles in breast fibroblast biology, bioinformatics tools were used to predict potential target genes of miR-222. We analysed the best possible miR-222 seed matches using miRanda, TargetScan and miRDB software. Eleven predicted target genes were chosen for further analysis based on the target scores, containing seed matches for miR-222. On analysis of expression by qRT-PCR in NFs and paired CAFs from patient samples three of these genes, RECK, THOP1 and LBR, demonstrated differential expression in the predicted direction. LBR showed the most substantial and consistent dysregulated result in NFs and CAFs, and therefore LBR was prioritised for subsequent analyses. The potential miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is depicted in Fig.\u00a02a. We performed a number of different assays to assess whether LBR is a true direct target of miR-222 within breast fibroblasts. First, luciferase reporter constructs containing either the wild-type miR-222 binding site from the LBR 3\u2032UTR or a mutated (non-binding) version of the site (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned. Reporters were co-transfected with miR-222 mimics and inhibitors, or appropriate controls, in NFs and CAFs respectively, and luciferase assays were performed. MiR-222 mimics significantly inhibited the activity of the luciferase reporter containing the wild-type LBR site, while the mutated site was insensitive to miR-222 overexpression in NFs (Fig.\u00a02b, left plot), whereas miR-222 inhibitors significantly increased the activity of the wild-type reporter, while the mutated reporter was again insensitive in CAFs (Fig.\u00a02b, right plot). Next, endogenous LBR expression was assessed in NFs after transfection to overexpress miR-222, and in CAFs after transfection with miR-222 inhibitors (Fig.\u00a02c, d). LBR expression was downregulated by miR-222 overexpression and upregulated by miR-222 inhibition at the level of both transcript (Fig.\u00a02c) and protein (Fig.\u00a02d), findings that were in accordance with it being downstream of miR-222 function. We concluded that LBR is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts, via a canonical miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR.Downregulation of LBR induces a CAF-like phenotypeOur next aim was to determine whether LBR downregulation is involved in determining the breast CAF phenotype, since we have already determined that CAFs overexpress miR-222 and that this can downregulate LBR. In one approach, we examined whether breast normal stroma or tumour stroma exhibit differential expression of LBR using immunohistochemistry. LBR expression (Fig.\u00a02e) was relatively reduced in tumour stroma, in contrast to ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin) (Fig.\u00a0S2), which was relatively high in tumour stroma. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed on eight matched pairs of primary NF and CAF cultures. LBR expression was significantly reduced by a mean of 4.3-fold in CAFs compared with the NFs (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in contrast to expression of the CAF markers ACTA2 and vimentin, which were upregulated in CAFs as expected and indicative of the CAF phenotype (Fig.\u00a02f, g).LBR regulates the NF vs CAF breast fibroblast phenotype. a, b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or control (NC), or plasmid to allow overexpression of LBR (LBR OE) or control plasmid (pCDNA), and LBR expression was assessed using qPCR (a) or western blots (b). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. c\u2013e Immortalised breast NFs (c, e) or CAFs (d, e) were transfected as shown, and the relative expression levels of the CAF marker genes \u03b1-SMA, fibroblast-specific protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were determined by qPCR (c, d), or of \u03b1-SMA and vimentin by western blot (e). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005We next assessed whether LBR downregulation was sufficient for transformation of NFs to CAFs, and conversely whether LBR overexpression would reduce CAF features. We transfected immortalised breast NFs with siRNA targeted against LBR or with an appropriate non-targeting control, and also transfected immortalised breast CAFs with plasmids to allow overexpression of LBR, or with appropriate control plasmids. The efficacy of knockdown and overexpression was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a) and western blots (Fig.\u00a03b); knockdown was to ~30% of the original levels, while overexpression was by more than ninefold. Next, we assessed expression of our panel of CAF markers in these cells after knockdown or overexpression of LBR using qRT-PCR or western blots as previously. Reduction of LBR expression in NFs, and increased expression of LBR in CAFs, significantly increased and decreased, respectively, the expression of all the CAF markers (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). We concluded that LBR is a key regulator of the breast CAF phenotype, and that knockdown of LBR alone is sufficient to transform NFs into cells that resemble CAFs.MiR-222 and LBR regulate migration, invasion and senescence in breast fibroblastsMiR-222 and its downstream target LBR modulate the behaviour of breast fibroblasts. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). a, b Migration (a) or invasion (b) of fibroblasts was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (a, b, upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (a, b, lower panels). c Expression of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase was also assessed by X-gal staining and is shown as blue green colouration (upper panels). Positive cells were quantified in data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). d Expression of the senescence markers MMP3 and osteopontin (OPN) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype markers IL6 and IL8 were assessed by qPCR in NFs (left plot) and CAFs (right plot). The data represent biological triplicates. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Since it has been previously demonstrated that CAFs are characterised by higher cell motility than their adjacent NFs, we also investigated whether miR-222 overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of LBR would induce increased NF migration or invasion, and conversely whether miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression would reduce CAF migration or invasion. Immortalised breast NFs or CAFs were transfected as previously with miR-222 mimics or inhibitors, respectively, or with siRNA targeted against LBR or overexpression of LBR, respectively. We then performed migration or invasion assays using transwell assays. NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siRNA targeting LBR had significantly higher migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, left plots), whereas inhibition of miR-222 or LBR overexpression in CAFs significantly reduced their migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, right plots). In order to confirm that these apparent effects on migration and invasion did not relate to differences in cell numbers induced by the transfections, we also evaluated proliferation capabilities of fibroblasts after these manipulations of miR-222 or LBR expression. We performed MTT assays after the same transfected conditions as mentioned above; there were no significant differences in proliferation of NFs or CAFs after any of these treatments (Fig.\u00a0S3). We concluded that miR-222 and its target LBR have key influences on aspects of CAF-like fibroblast behaviour, namely migration and invasion.It was previously reported that loss of LBR is associated with induction of cellular senescence, therefore, we also specifically evaluated senescence by determining senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activities in NFs and CAFs after dysregulation of expression of miR-222 or LBR. We found an increased SA-\u03b2-gal activity in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siLBR compared to controls (Fig.\u00a04c, left plot). In addition, inhibition of miR-222 activity or increased LBR expression in CAFs significantly reduced SA-\u03b2-gal activity (Fig.\u00a04c, right plot). We also further examined features of this senescence phenotype by determining whether it was also associated with differential expression of other senescence markers. NFs and CAFs were transfected as before, and qRT-PCR was used to assess expression of MMP3, OPN, IL6 and IL8, which are upregulated in senescent cells particularly those showing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Expression of all four markers was significantly upregulated in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimic or siLBR (Fig.\u00a04d, left plot), while expression was significantly downregulated in CAFs transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or to overexpress LBR (Fig.\u00a04d, right plot). This provided strong support that changes in \u03b2-gal activity we had detected were indeed associated with senescence, and that miR-222 and LBR expression impact on senescence phenotypes in breast fibroblasts.miR-222 and LBR in breast fibroblasts regulate proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cellsMiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to influence cancer cell proliferation and metastatic potential. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. a, b Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled was determined using MTT assay. The data represent biological triplicates. c\u2013f Migration (c, e) or invasion (d, f) of epithelial cancer cells was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05To better understand the exact effects of miR-222 and its action on LBR in fibroblasts on epithelial breast cancer cell behaviour, we assessed abilities of NFs and CAFs after manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression to induce growth or migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. In particular, we focused on the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and the relatively less metastatic and triple-negative MDA-MB-157 cell lines. In order to assess influences of fibroblasts on the cancer cells, we decided to collect conditioned medium from fibroblasts and treat cancer cells with this. Fibroblast-conditioned medium has frequently been shown to influence cancer cell behaviour in this context. NFs or CAFs were transfected exactly as previously. Conditional medium (CM) was collected from these cells after transfection, and was added to cultures of epithelial breast cancer cells. First, proliferation of epithelial cells was assessed using MTT assays after treatment with CM (Fig.\u00a05a, b). In both epithelial cell lines, CM from control NFs caused a marginal, but not significant, reduction in proliferation, while CM from control CAFs caused a marked and significant increase in proliferation when compared with cells without CM (p\u2009<\u20090.005), as has been reported previously. More interestingly, overexpression of miR-222 in NFs and knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs significantly altered the activity of these CMs on both epithelial cell lines; miR-222 overexpression in NFs produced CM that had similar growth inducing effects to that from control CAFs, while knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs reduced this growth stimulation (Fig.\u00a05a). Changes in LBR expression within NFs and CAFs also had similar significant effects, with LBR knockdown allowing CM from NFs to induce relative growth increases, while overexpression of LBR in CAFs reduced the growth stimulatory effect of CAF CM (Fig.\u00a05b). We concluded that upregulation of miR-222 and downregulation of LBR were both necessary and sufficient for CAF function with respect to inducing proliferation of breast cancer cells. Next, we investigated the influences of these CMs on the motility of BC cells. BC cells also responded dramatically and significantly to these CMs in terms of migration and invasion capacities. CM from NFs had little influence on migration, while CM from CAFs significant and consistently induced migration (Fig.\u00a05c, e) and invasion (Fig.\u00a05d, f) in both epithelial cell lines. Overexpression of miR-222 or knockdown of LBR in NFs led to enhanced migration in the epithelial lines. Knockdown of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs led to reduced migration in the epithelial lines. Exactly the same result was evident in terms of invasion, with miR-222 and LBR having a key influence on abilities of NFs or CAFs to induce invasion in both epithelial cell lines (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013f). To further clarify that differences in migration/invasion of the breast cancer epithelial cells treated with CM did not solely relate to changes in proliferation rate, we additionally performed an experiment assessing proliferation in the cells treated exactly as for the migration/invasion assay (Fig.\u00a0S4), which involves an earlier time point than that used for Fig.\u00a05a, b. There were no significant differences in almost all combinations, supporting the conclusion that true differences in migration/invasion were seen. An exception is MDA-MB-157 cells treated with CAF CM, in which a significant reduction in proliferation was seen with CM after miR-222 knockdown and LBR overexpression; however, this change in proliferation was only up to 20% (Fig.\u00a0S4), whereas decreases in migration/invasion were up to 50% (Fig.\u00a05e, f), indicating that\u2014again\u2014true influences on migration/invasion were seen.MiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to activate EMT in breast cancer cells. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. Expression levels of the EMT-associated genes slug and vimentin were assessed in MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled using qPCR (a, c) or western blots (b, d). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Finally, to determine whether the fibroblasts were influencing migration and invasion capacity of epithelial cells by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways, we analysed expression of EMT markers slug and vimentin in the BC cells after culture with the same CMs, using both qRT-PCR and western blots (Fig.\u00a06). CM from NFs had little influence on slug or vimentin expression at either transcript or protein level, while CM from CAFs induced up to a sixfold increase in expression. Manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression in the fibroblasts consistently and significantly altered slug and vimentin expression in accordance with the changes in migration and invasion, with greater slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade more by miR-222 mimics or LBR siRNA in NFs, and reduced slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade less by miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression in CAFs. We concluded that miR-222 and, downstream of this, LBR have key influences on abilities of breast fibroblasts to control critical cancer-related behaviours of breast epithelial cancer cells, including proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT.DiscussionIncreasing evidence supports the proposal that miRNA dysregulation within CAFs modulates function of the tumour microenvironment. However, it is worth highlighting that most studies have emphasised investigation of miRNA roles within the tumour cells themselves, therefore it remains the case that relatively little is known about roles of miRNAs in the tumour microenvironment. In this study, we have focussed on roles of miR-222 within fibroblasts.We initially compared the miR-222 expression difference between CAFs and adjacent NFs in breast cancer tissue samples. Our study demonstrated that miR-222 was significantly upregulated in CAFs. Although others have made similar comparisons for multiple miRNAs in this context, miR-222 has not previously been identified as differentially expressed. This may be because studies have not always effectively purified only the fibroblasts for their analyses, as we have by LMD, or may be because miR-222 was not always included in the analyses. Next, we identified that miR-222 targets Lamin B receptor (LBR) expression in the CAFs. Various targets of miR-222 have been published previously, but LBR is a novel target on which we focused since we were able to confirm its downregulation in CAFs in accordance with negative regulation by the upregulated miR-222. Most importantly, downregulation of LBR with siRNA phenocopied miR-222 overexpression in functional experiments using breast fibroblasts, strongly suggesting that LBR is a key functionally important target of miR-222 in these cells.In terms of cellular function, we showed that miR-222 and LBR were both involved in defining and maintaining the breast CAF phenotype in terms of expression patterns, and fibroblast behaviours including migration and invasion. MiR-222 has previously been assigned roles in promotion of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and drug resistance within cancer cells, so our findings are in accordance with this, although they represent the first observations to our knowledge in a cancer stromal cell type. With respect to functions of LBR, a role in senescence has previously been reported in fibroblasts and we also observed a related result with manipulation of LBR expression by siRNA, overexpression or via miR-222 all impacting on senescence in breast fibroblasts. LBR encodes the lamin B receptor, a 70.4-kD protein of the inner nuclear membrane, which is known to interact with heterochromatin and B-type lamins. Other functions for the protein have been implied by observations that ectopic LBR expression deregulates differentiation of olfactory neurons inducing an un- or early-differentiated state.More excitingly, we showed that fibroblasts with differential expression of miR-222 or LBR have potent differential influences on behaviour of two independent breast epithelial cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that conditioned medium from fibroblasts that were stimulated to be more CAF-like by miR-222 overexpression or siLBR promoted breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. Similarly, abilities of conditioned medium from CAFs to promote breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion was inhibited by reduced miR-222 levels or by LBR overexpression. Next, we investigated possible pathways involved in the breast tumour motility effects. We found that the enhanced migration and invasion were associated with increased expression of vimentin and slug in the BC cells, suggesting involvement of the EMT pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-222 upregulation, and subsequent LBR downregulation, within fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment contribute to progression of BC, through induction of proliferation and EMT-related motility. It is established that cancer progression is not only dependent on tumour cells themselves but also dependent on the tumour microenvironment and, in particular, CAFs, which promote growth and invasion of cancer cells through synthesis and remodelling of ECM and secreting some growth factors. Hence, blocking CAF activity may be a key approach to effectively control cancer metastasis. Manipulation of either miR-222 expression or LBR function provide candidate approaches for development of these types of anti-cancer therapies. In particular, our data demonstrate that reduced expression of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs greatly reduces their ability to promote aggressive behaviours in cancer cells, supporting the proposal that CAF phenotypes are not fixed and could be normalised therapeutically.Surprisingly, our data also implicate the miR-222/LBR axis in senescence induction in CAFs. Previous studies have indicated that increased miR-222 or loss of LBR induces senescence, so this is not a surprise in itself; however, it is unexpected that high levels of senescence in CAFs would be associated with cancer cell behaviours that promote progression, since senescence is often regarded as a tumour-suppressor mechanism in cancer cells. However, more recent evidence shows that senescent cells may promote oncogenesis through secretion of secretory factors (SASP) and several reports describe abilities of senescent human fibroblasts to promote growth and tumorigenesis. In support of this, here, we demonstrated that miR-222 overexpression in NFs induces a SASP phenotype, leading to increased secretion of at least the SASP factors IL6 and IL8, and the classical senescence marker MMP3.In conclusion, we present miR-222 and LBR as key molecules involved in transformation and maintenance of breast CAFs, which in turn therefore impacts on the aggressive tumorigenic behaviour of breast cancer cells. These molecules are novel targets for therapeutic intervention.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-019-0566-7.Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.Ethics approval and consent to participateEthical approval for collection and use of human tissue was obtained from the Leeds East Research Ethics Committee, references 06/Q1206/180 and 09/H1306/108, and also from the Ethical Committee, Medical College, Kolkata, references MC/KOL/IEC/NON-SPON/102/09-2015.FundingThe study has been funded by University Grants Commission (UGC), India [F.101-5/2014(IC)] and Royal Society, UK (Ref No. IE160146).

        "content": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) is a pleiotropic cytokine with the capability to act as tumour suppressor or tumour promoter depending on the cellular context. TGF-beta receptor type-2 (TGFBR2) is the ligand-binding receptor for all members of the TGF-\u03b2 family. Data from mouse model experiments demonstrated that loss of Tgfbr2 expression in mammary fibroblasts was linked to tumour initiation and metastasis. Using a randomised tamoxifen trial cohort including in total 564 invasive breast carcinomas, we examined TGFBR2 expression (n=252) and phosphorylation level of downstream target SMAD2 (pSMAD2) (n=319) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and assessed links to clinicopathological markers, prognostic and treatment-predictive values. The study revealed that CAF-specific TGFBR2 expression correlated with improved recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed CAF-TGFBR2 to be an independent prognostic marker (multivariate Cox regression, hazard ratio: 0.534, 95% (CI): 0.360-0.793, P=0.002). CAF-specific pSMAD2 levels, however, did not associate with survival outcome. Experimentally, TGF-\u03b2 signalling in fibroblasts was modulated using a TGF-\u03b2 ligand and inhibitor or through lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated TGFBR2-specific knockdown. To determine the role of fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway on breast cancer cells, we used cell contact-dependent cell growth and clonogenicity assays, which showed that knockdown of TGFBR2 in CAFs resulted in increased cell growth, proliferation and clonogenic survival. Further, in a mouse model transfected CAFs were co-injected with MCF7 and tumour weight and proportion was monitored. We found that mouse xenograft tumours comprising TGFBR2 knockdown fibroblasts were slightly bigger and displayed increased tumour cell capacity. Overall, our data demonstrate that fibroblast-related biomarkers possess clinically relevant information and that fibroblasts confer effects on breast cancer cell growth and survival. Regulation of tumour-stromal cross-talk through fibroblastic TGF-\u03b2 pathway may depend on fibroblast phenotype, emphasising the importance to characterise tumour microenvironment subtypes. ",

        "content": "We studied the tumor uptake of [67Ga]citrate, [59Fe]citrate, and 125I-labeled transferrin (TF) by the in vitro growth form of EMT-6, a sarcoma-like mammary tumor of BALB/c mice. In analyzing the binding experiments, we developed a new mathematical model based on a formulation originally used to express the interaction of hormones with specific tissue receptors. The uptake of both carrier-free 67Ga and 59Fe by tumor cells was mediated by kinetically identical TF receptors. We also studied teric acid extracts of the stroma of EMT-6 tumors grown both in vivo and in vitro. Chromatography of these extracts on Sephacryl S-200 SF demonstrated that the cellular stroma contained specific TF-binding macromolecules. On the basis of these findings, we proposed the \"transferrin receptor hypothesis\" for the mechanism of 67Ga uptake by tumors. According to this view, a tumor-associated TF receptor is the functional unit responsible for the affinity of gallium for certain neoplasms. This receptor was also active in the uptake of iron by tumors.",

        "full_text": "Periventricular nodular heterotopia in 22q11.2 deletion and frontal lobe migrationAbstractObjectiveWe aimed to delineate the distribution of periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) in patients with 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) and place this in the context of other genetic forms of PNH.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed brain imaging and postmortem data available for adult patients with 22q11.2DS. We included only those with good quality MRI data (n\u00a0=\u00a029) in addition to two patients with PNH identified through postmortem studies. We also reviewed the pattern of PNH in all genetic conditions reported with this phenotype.ResultsOf the total seven patients (M\u00a0=\u00a04, F\u00a0=\u00a03; age: 19\u201361\u00a0years) identified to have PNH, six had a history of seizures, six had schizophrenia, six had variable levels of intellectual disability, and two had obsessive compulsive disorder. In all seven patients, the nodules were located over the dorsal pole of the frontal horn of the lateral ventricles. The nodules were small, noncontiguous, and ranged in number from 1 to 10 per individual. Our review identified 37 genetic conditions associated with PNH. With the cases reported here, 22q11.2DS becomes the fifth most commonly reported genetic condition, and the third most common copy number variation, associated with PNH.InterpretationThe neuropsychiatric manifestations in our patients with PNH support other data indicating abnormal neurodevelopment as part of the pathogenesis of 22q11.2DS.The location and cellular characteristics of PNH in 22q11.2DS overlaps with a group of migrating postnatal interneurons termed Arc cells, although more research is needed to confirm that PNH in 22q11.2DS represents Arc cells arrested in their migratory pathway.Introduction22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), which encompasses conditions formerly known as velocardiofacial syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome, is the most common pathogenic copy number variation (CNV) in humans, affecting about 1 in 4000 people.1 In adults with 22q11.2DS neuropsychiatric disorders such as intellectual disability, seizures and schizophrenia are a significant cause of morbidity.2, 3, 4 The prevalence of recurrent seizure disorder in adults with 22q11.2DS is estimated to be about 11%.4 Seizures may be triggered by hypocalcemia, fever, and/or antipsychotic medications. Epilepsy is reported in patients with epileptogenic structural brain abnormalities, such as periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH), polymicrogyria, etc. In many cases, however, no additional risk factors can be identified, and the unprovoked, recurrent seizures are thought to result from genetic generalized epilepsy or focal epilepsy.4, 5, 6, 7 Schizophrenia is seen in up to 25% of 22q11.2DS patients.8 Comprising up to 1% of all schizophrenia patients, 22q11.2DS is the most common detectable genetic cause of schizophrenia.9 The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to schizophrenia are believed to be related to abnormal neural development.10 Identifying PNH in the first postmortem pathology of a patient with 22q11.2DS11 prompted us to study the presence of these lesions through high\u2010resolution brain imaging. In the current, we set out to study the anatomical characteristics of PNH and explore its association with the neuropsychiatric manifestations of 22q11.2DS patients.MethodsPatientsAdult 22q11.2DS patients were recruited from the epilepsy genetics clinic at Toronto Western Hospital, University of Toronto, and were further screened for the presence of PNH. Of 35 patients who had brain MRI data, 6 were excluded due to poor quality images. We included two additional patients with 22q11.2DS, whose postmortem studies were previously reported by our team.11, 12 Demographic and clinical features of the 31 patients were obtained from chart reviews and included age, sex, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric history. The diagnosis of 22q11.2DS for these patients was previously established by FISH or clinical microarray, and their consent for inclusion in the study was obtained as per research ethics board (REB) protocols at the University Health Network and/or Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.Imaging22q11.2DS patients underwent 3 Tesla brain MRI with a dedicated seizure protocol including high\u2010resolution axial and coronal T1 IR and T2 FLAIR sequences as well as isotropic T1 FSPGR sequences with multiplanar reformats.13 In addition, axial DWI and SWI\u2010weighted sequences were obtained. Images were reviewed in consensus by a neuroradiologist specialized in epilepsy imaging (TK) and 2 neurologists (AR, DA).Additional genetic studiesIn addition to standard clinical features and the FISH confirmation of typical 22q11.2 deletion in all 7 patients, five patients also had whole genome sequencing (WGS) as part of another study.14 The WGS data was used in this study only to determine if patients with PNH had other structural genomic rearrangements such as CNV or single nucleotide variant (SNV) previously associated with known causes of PNH. A sixth patient had genome\u2010wide high\u2010resolution research microarray.Literature reviewWe used PubMed (January 1, 1993 to February 20, 2018) to review the literature regarding causes of PNH and its distribution, using the following terms: ((periventricular or ventricular or ventricle or ventricles) (nodular or nodule or nodules) (heterotopia or heterotopic)) AND (deletion or duplication or (copy number) or chromosomal or chromosome or syndrome or syndromic or syndromal or genetic or genomic or gene or mutation).ResultsOf the 29 alive patients ascertained with usable MRI data, five (17.2%) had PNH (Fig.\u00a01A\u2013E). Three of these 5 patients had been reported previously by our team. (patients 1, 2 and 4).6 For one of the two patients in whom PNH was identified through autopsy,11, 12 MRI data had previously been interpreted as normal; however, re\u2010review of MRI after postmortem findings confirmed the diagnosis of PNH (Fig.\u00a01F). Of the seven patients with PNH studied, three were female. Intellectual disability (ID) was present in six, ranging from mild to severe. Six of these seven patients had a history of acute symptomatic seizures or epilepsy. In these, the median age of seizure onset was 12.5\u00a0years. The seizure types included generalized tonic clonic, myoclonic, and/or focal impaired awareness seizures. Six of the seven patients had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and two were diagnosed with obsessive\u2010compulsive disorder (OCD) (Table\u00a01).Brain MRIs of six patients with 22q11.2DS.

Nodules were unilateral in five patients and single in four patients (Table\u00a01). Patients with multiple nodules had no more than 10 nodules seen on MRI or macroscopically at autopsy. However, on both autopsy cases, several other small nodules were seen only microscopically.11 For instance, patient 6 had multiple microscopic, spherical noncontiguous nodules, closely spaced around the larger macroscopic nodules (Fig.\u00a02B). In addition, there were \u201clarge numbers of individual cortical\u2010type neurons found in the white matter of the frontal lobe between the heterotopic nodules and the nearest cortical surface\u201d (Fig.\u00a02C).11 The postmortem macroscopic study of patient 7 revealed several small, nodular heterotopia in the deep frontal white matter near the anterior horn of the lateral ventricle (Fig.\u00a02D). Immunohistochemistry studies showed these nodules were formed by mature neurons and GABAergic interneurons\u2010expressing NeuN, calretinin, and synaptophysin (Fig.\u00a02D\u2013F).12 Neuropathologic features in patients with 22q11.2DS (A\u2013C from Patient 6, D\u2013F from Patient 7).

(C) Frequent individual heterotopic neurons were detected in the white matter surrounding the heterotopias. Magnification (insets) reveals cytologic details, such as pyramidal shapes.

(E) Immunohistochemistry for NeuN labels the neurons in the nodule, suggesting that they are fully differentiated. (F) Higher magnification of nodule with immunostain for Calretinin, a marker of cortical interneurons.WGS on patients 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 did not reveal any other pathogenic SNVs or CNVs known to be associated with PNH Supplemental Table\u00a01).14 Genome\u2010wide microarray in patient 3 also did not reveal additional CNVs, only the known 22q11.2 microdeletion. To place these 22q11.2DS findings in the context of the overall genetic etiology of PNH, we performed a literature review. Table\u00a0S1 shows the genes and/or rare CNVs associated with PNH along with a brief description of anatomical distribution of PNH reported. As of February 2018, there were 37 genetic abnormalities associated with various patterns of PNH. The new patients reported here make 22q11.2 microdeletion the third most common CNV and the fifth most common genetic cause described in association with PNH. The details of other CNVs and the characteristics of the PNHs reported are listed in Table\u00a0S1.DiscussionGenetics of PNH and its distributionAlthough the number of patient is small, the PNH characteristics observed in our patients with 22q11.2DS were consistent: small nodules, noncontiguous, varying in number from 1 to 10, located over the dorsal pole of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricles (DPAHLV), uni\u2010 or bilaterally. Furthermore, microscopic nodules were present at the tip of the DPAHLV and more distantly along the deep frontal white matter, between the DPAHLV and the cortex in the frontal lobes.PNH has been previously reported in three children with 22q11.2DS.7, 15 The patient reported by Kim et\u00a0al., had a single PNH over the DPAHLV.7 The MRIs of the other 2 children demonstrated symmetrical bilateral PNH, lining the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles with limited extension into the frontal horns in one of the patients.15Although the PNH distribution in these two children may still be attributed to the 22q11.2 microdeletion, it is not clear whether these patients had other CNVs or SNVs in other genes that could have accounted for the difference in their distribution, since one of those patients was diagnosed through FISH and the other had a low\u2010resolution array only. Five of our seven patients had WGS which ruled out the presence of mutations in any other genes previously known to be associated with PNH, as well as the presence of other pathogenic CNVs. No other CNV was detected in patient 3 as per high\u2010resolution genome\u2010wide chromosome microarray.The literature review showed that the majority of patients with PNH and a known genetic cause have heterozygous filamin\u2010A (FLNA) pathogenic variants.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 This is frequently (but not always) associated with the \u201cclassical bilateral PNH\u201d pattern, where nodules are often large, multiple, contiguous, symmetric and abutting the walls of the ventricles. They are distributed bilaterally, along the frontal horns and ventricular bodies, almost always sparing the temporal horns, or with minor temporal involvement, and limited extension into the posterior horns.17, 20, 23 17q21.31 microdeletion represents the second most commonly reported genetic cause of PNH, with small, single, unilateral nodules. Autosomal recessive mutations in the ARFGEF2 gene represent the third most commonly reported genetic etiology of PNH with diffuse bilateral near\u2010contiguous or contiguous pattern often associated with a microcephaly phenotype.24, 25, 26 6q27 deletion is the fourth most commonly reported cause of PNH with uni or bilateral nodules in the frontal and temporal horns of the lateral ventricles. With the cases reported here, 22q11.2 microdeletion is the fifth most common genetic cause and the third most common CNV reported in association with PNH (see Table\u00a0S1).PNH in 22q11.2DS might result from arrested \u201cArc\u201d migrating cellsAlthough this study was not designed to determine the origin of PNH in 22q11.2 microdeletion, a remarkable overlap with a recently described population of late migrating neurons called \u201cArc cells\u201d27 was observed. Therefore, we briefly discuss the hypothesis that PNH in 22q11.2DS may result from arrested migration of these cells.In postnatal infant human brain an \u201cArc\u201d of migrating cells moves away from the subventricular zone (SVZ) around the DPAHLV towards the anterior cingulate gyrus and prefrontal cortex (Fig.\u00a03). The migrating neuroblasts are organized in chains or individual cells. In brains studied from 34 gestational weeks to 7\u00a0months of life, the neuronal migration process is divided into four tiers with different cell concentrations in different regions at different times. Tier 1 neurons are densely packed in the SVZ around the DPAHLV walls. Tiers 2 and 3 have clusters of neurons that are progressively more distant from the ventricles. Tier 4 neurons are dispersed within areas of the developing white matter, closer to the cortex.27 Given the reported distribution of cells in this Arc, it is possible that in our population of 22q11.2DS patients, the larger PNHs observed on MRI maybe neurons whose migration was arrested in the Arc tiers 1 or 2, while the microscopic nodules and individual neurons observed in the autopsy cases are representative of neurons in the Arc tiers 3 and 4. In addition to the anatomical overlap, both Arc cells and 22q11.2DS neurons studied at autopsy express GABA and calretinin.11, 12, 27 Finally, Arc cells express CXCR4 receptor, a marker of migrating interneurons.27 Interestingly, 22q11.2 deletion leads to a significant decrease in the expression of Cxcr4,28 suggesting that 22q11.2 haploinsufficiency could have a role in the abnormal migration of Arc cells.Unilateral schematic representation of Arc cells surrounding the dorsal pole of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricles, with the four tiers of cells migrating toward the cortex.The Arc is the only migratory pathway described so far that appears to overlap with the PNH findings in patients with 22q.11.2DS. The other group of cells which migrate from the anterior horn of the lateral ventricles, leaves the SVZ through the floor of the ventricles (the \u201crostral migratory stream\u201d (RMS)).29 Therefore, the arrested migration of RMS cells would be expected to produce PNH around the ventral pole of the anterior horn of the lateral ventricles.Supporting the hypothesis that PNH is caused by 22q11.2 microdeletion is the fact that six genes located in the 22q11.2 deletion region are relevant for corticogenesis: Cdc45\u00a0l and Ranbp1 genes are \u201cspecifically and robustly\u201d expressed in VZ/SVZ. Htf9c and Ufd1\u00a0l genes are expressed in the VZ/SVZ but also in the developing cortical plate; Hira is weakly distributed throughout the developing cortex and Sept5 is present in the developing cortical plate and absent in the VZ/SVZ.30 Neuropsychiatric symptoms, anatomical and molecular correlationAlthough the large majority of patients with 22q11.2DS have the same 3\u00a0Mb deletion, not all patients manifest all the phenotypes associated to this syndrome. This is likely due to the complex interplay between the hemizygous deletion, the reminder of the patient's genome and to a certain degree, the environment.Six out of the 7 patients described here had a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, 2 had OCD, 6 had ID, and 6 had seizures. Seizures could be a result of the PNH (which contains epileptogenic cells)31 although patients with 22q11.2DS and no structural abnormalities also have an overall lower seizure threshold.4 Schizophrenia, OCD and ID have been associated with multiple structural abnormalities, including abnormal cortical thickness and connectivity in the cingulate, prefrontal cortex, olfactory bulb, amongst other regions.32, 33, 34, 35, 36 Postmortem studies of non\u201022q11.2DS schizophrenic brains have also shown decline in GABAergic interneurons most prominently in pre\u2010frontal and cingulate association cortices.37, 38 If the cells that form the PNH in our patients are derived from the Arc, and Arc cells were destined to cingulate and pre\u2010frontal cortex, it is plausible that adult patients with 22q11.2DS and PNH have fewer cells in those regions, which could contribute, at least in part, to their phenotype.PNH and (possibly) arrested Arc cells migration are not the only mechanism of abnormal neurodevelopment that could underlie the neuropsychiatric manifestations in 22q11.2 patients, but they reflect a disturbed corticogenesis. For instance, 22q11.2DS has been associated with a postnatal generalized microcolumnar cerebral cortical architecture,39 supporting the role of genes in 22q11.2 deletion interval in the process of maturation. Tbx1 gene, which is present in the typical 22q11.2 deletion interval, plays a significant role in prefrontal corticogenesis including migration of inhibitory cells of prefrontal and olfactory bulb from the ganglionic eminence (GE) through RMS.40, 41 A Tbx1 haploinsufficiancy model caused thinner proliferating zones in the mediolateral cortex and GE.41 Animal models of Ranbp1 (another gene in the typical 22q11.2 interval) loss of function show decreased size of GE, decreased proliferation of forebrain progenitor cells, thinned cortex (especially cortical layers 2 and 3) and decreased size of olfactory bulbs.42 Interestingly, RANBP1 gene polymorphisms have been associated with schizophrenia vulnerability in non\u201022q11.2DS individuals.43 There are some limitations to this study: Two of the seven patients did not have WGS (although one of these 2 had genome\u2010wide high\u2010resolution chromosomal microarray). This retrospective study was not designed to measure cortical thickness reported in 22q11.2DS imaging.44 Furthermore, it is unclear if such a small number of cells that are retained in the PNH would lead to abnormal cortical thickness detectable by current imaging technology. Finally, this was a clinical study, and further experimental studies would be needed to evaluate any relationship between Arc cells migration and 22q11.2DS.In conclusion, we describe the radiological and pathological characteristics of PNH in 7 adult patients with 22q11.2DS. The anatomical and immunohistochemical features of 22q11.2DS related\u2010PNH, and additional surrounding microscopic heterotopic neurons found at autopsy suggest that this abnormality could result from arrested migration of Arc cells. Since Arc cells are mainly destined to the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, it is expected that these regions would have subtle cytoarchitectural and physiological abnormalities, which may contribute to the common neuropsychiatric features seen in 22q11.2DS such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, OCD, and ID.Author ContributionsA.R., and E.B. performed the chart review, analyzed the data, and are the primary authors of the manuscript and tables.\u00a0T.R.K provided the pathological data of the patients used in the study.

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "content": "The triple-negative breast cancer subtype (TNBC) is highly aggressive and metastatic and corresponds to 15-20% of diagnosed cases. TNBC treatment is hampered, because these cells usually do not respond to hormonal therapy, and they develop resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. On the other hand, the severe side effects of cisplatin represent an obstacle for its clinical use. Ruthenium (Ru)-based complexes have emerged as promising antitumor and antimetastatic substitutes for cisplatin. In this study, we demonstrated the effects of a Ru/biphosphine complex, containing gallic acid (GA) as a ligand, [Ru(GA)(dppe)<sub2</sub]PF<sub6</sub, hereafter called Ru(GA), on a TNBC cell line, and compared them to the effects in a nontumor breast cell line. Ru(GA) complex presented selective cytotoxicity against TNBC over nontumor cells, inhibited its migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis. These effects were associated with the increased amount of transferrin receptors (TfR) on tumor cells, compared to nontumor ones. Silencing of TfR decreased Ru(GA) effects on TNBC cells, demonstrating that these receptors were at least partially responsible for Ru(GA) delivery into tumor cells.

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown.

Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

        "content": "Carboxymethyl Benzylamide Dextran (CMDB7) displayed an in vitro growth inhibitory activity on breast tumor cells. CMDB7 is able to disrupt the interaction of angiogenic growth factors (FGF2, TGF beta and PDGF) with their membrane receptors. This compound blocks the angiogenesis of MDA-MB435 carcinoma xenografted in mammary fat pad and their lung metastases in nude mice. In this work, we studied the uptake of CMDB7 labeled with 99mTc in cultured human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line and the highly tumorigenic MCF-7ras cell line (Ha-ras-transfected MCF-7 cells) and the in vivo distribution in MCF-7ras tumor-bearing mice. The 99mTc-CMDB7 are stable and the intracellular concentration is time-dependent and reaches a plateau at 180 minutes. 99mTc CMDB7 uptake is much higher in MCF-7ras cells than MCF-7 cells. Since CMDB7 is internalized and could also inhibit cell proliferation by acting at nuclear sites, we investigated the MCF-7ras nuclear localization after cell fractionation. Cell fractionation revealed a cytoplasmic and nuclear internalization of CMDB7. The tumor uptakes of 99mTc-CMDB7 were 0.34%, 0.72% and 0.62% of the administrated doses per gram of tumor tissue at 1 hour, 3 hour and 5 hours respectively after their injection. The blood clearance of 99mTc CMDB7 was very rapid and the liver, spleen and kidney uptakes were very weak.

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

        "title": "Isolation of normal and cancer-associated fibroblasts from fresh tissues by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most prominent cell type within the tumor stroma of many cancers, in particular breast carcinoma, and their prominent presence is often associated with poor prognosis. CAFs are an activated subpopulation of stromal fibroblasts, many of which express the myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. CAFs originate from local tissue fibroblasts as well as from bone marrow-derived cells recruited into the developing tumor and adopt a CAF phenotype under the influence of the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were shown to facilitate tumor initiation, growth and progression through signaling that promotes tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. We demonstrated that CAFs enhance tumor growth by mediating tumor-promoting inflammation, starting at the earliest pre-neoplastic stages. Despite increasing evidence of the key role CAFs play in facilitating tumor growth, studying CAFs has been an on-going challenge due to the lack of CAF-specific markers and the vast heterogeneity of these cells, with many subtypes co-existing in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, studying fibroblasts in vitro is hindered by the fact that their gene expression profile is often altered in tissue culture. To address this problem and to allow unbiased gene expression profiling of fibroblasts from fresh mouse and human tissues, we developed a method based on previous protocols for Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Our approach relies on utilizing PDGFR\u03b1 as a surface marker to isolate fibroblasts from fresh mouse and human tissue. PDGFR\u03b1 is abundantly expressed by both normal fibroblasts and CAFs. This method allows isolation of pure populations of normal fibroblasts and CAFs, including, but not restricted to \u03b1-SMA+ activated myofibroblasts. Isolated fibroblasts can then be used for characterization and comparison of the evolution of gene expression that occurs in CAFs during tumorigenesis. Indeed, we and others reported expression profiling of fibroblasts isolated by cell sorting. This protocol was successfully performed to isolate and profile highly enriched populations of fibroblasts from skin, mammary, pancreas and lung tissues. Moreover, our method also allows culturing of sorted cells, in order to perform functional experiments and to avoid contamination by tumor cells, which is often a big obstacle when trying to culture CAFs.",

        "title": "Complex influence of dermatan sulphate on breast cancer cells.",
        "content": "Tumor transformation and progression both lead to extracellular matrix remodeling, which is also reflected in an alteration in the proportion of dermatan sulphate (DS) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) and an accumulation of the latter. In addition, a significant increase in the 6-O-sulphated disaccharide contribution to the structure of both glycosaminoglycans has been observed. It is commonly accepted that CS is more permissive for tumor growth than DS. However, the detailed role of DS in tumor progression is poorly known. We tested the effects of structurally different DSs on the behavior of cultured breast cancer cells. At a high dose (10\u2009\u00b5g/mL), all of the DSs significantly reduced cancer cell growth, although some differences in the efficiency of action were apparent. In contrast, when used at a concentration of 1\u2009\u00b5g/mL, the examined DSs evoked different responses ranging from the stimulation to the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. The highest stimulatory activity was associated with fibrosis-affected fascia decorin DS, which is characterized by a particularly high content of 6-O-sulphated disaccharides. Further reduction in DS concentration to 0.5\u2009\u00b5g/mL preserved majority of biological effects which were apparent at a dose of 1\u2009\u00b5g/mL. The enzymatic fragmentation of the DSs, particularly by chondroitinase AC I, abolished the impact exerted by 1\u2009\u00b5g/mL of the intact DS chains and sometimes resulted in the opposite effect. In contrast to DSs, highly sulphated C-6-S exhibited no effect on the cancer cells. Our data revealed the complexity of the effects of DSs on breast cancer cells, which include both co-receptor activity and the prevention of vascular endothelial growth factor action. In addition, the biological effect of DSs is strongly dependent not only on the glycosaminoglycan structure but also on its content in the cancer environment. ",

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min.

(B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm).

(C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay.

In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm.

MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay.

Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "content": "<bBackground:</b Deferoxamine (DFO) is a commonly used iron chelator, which can reduce the iron levels in cells. DFO is normally used to treat iron-overload disease, including some types of cancer. However, our previous studies revealed that DFO treatment significantly increased the iron concentrations in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) resulting\u00a0in enhanced cell migration. But the mechanism of DFO-induced increasing iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs still remained unclear. <bMaterials and methods:</b Iron metabolism-related proteins in aggressive breast cancer MDA-MB-231, HS578T and BT549 cells and nonaggressive breast cancer MCF-7 and T47D cells were examined by immunofluorescence and Western blotting.

Breast cancer undergoes broad changes in iron metabolism and exhibits increased ability to iron sequestration. Numerous studies suggest that the iron level is much higher in the tissues and serum of the breast cancer patients than that in healthy people. Iron accumulation in breast cancer cells promotes breast cancer initiation, growth and metastasis.Deregulation of cellular iron metabolism is reflected by the altered expression of iron-regulatory proteins in human breast cancer cells. The expression of iron import proteins, such as transferrin receptor (TfR1) and iron-storage protein, ferritin in aggressive breast cancer cells are frequently elevated, while the levels of the iron efflux protein, ferroportin is suppressed. As a transmembrane receptor protein, TfR1 combines with iron transport protein transferrin (Tf) and assists iron uptake through endocytosis. Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is identified as the non-transferrin-bound serum iron (NTBI) pathway, responsible for ferrous iron uptake. DMT1 is also located on the surface of cell membrane and can transport extracellular ferrous ions. Many studies have shown that irregular iron metabolism and the activated iron-uptake related pathways in breast cancer cells disrupt the iron regulatory network.Iron chelators could be used to prevent tumor progression in patients. Deferoxamine (DFO) is the first iron chelator to be used as an anticancer drug. In our previous study, we used DFO to determine the iron metabolism in breast cancer cells. Our results indicated that DFO could decrease iron concentration in non-aggressive estrogen receptor-alpha (ER\u03b1) -positive breast cancer cell lines, while increase iron concentration in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (TNBCs) leading to enhance migration of breast cancer cells. But the mechanism of the increased iron uptake in TNBCs under the iron deficient condition induced by DFO was still remained unclear.In order to investigate iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs under the iron-deficient condition induced by DFO, we hypothesized that DFO could up-regulate the expression of iron-related proteins to enhance iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs. In this study, three aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cells, Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231, and two non-aggressive ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells, T47D, MCF-7, were used as cellular models treated with DFO to regulate intracellular iron metabolism to investigate the link between the altered iron concentration and the expression of iron-related proteins. The possible DFO-induced iron regulatory pathways in aggressive TNBCs were also investigated. Our study was shown that iron uptake-related proteins such as DMT1 and TfR1 expression were increased after 24\u00a0h following DFO treatment in aggressive TNBCs, which were involved in increasing intracellular iron uptake by activating IL-6/PI3K/AKT pathways.Materials and methodsCell cultureTriple-negative breast cancer cell lines (Hs578T, BT549, MDA-MB-231), and ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF-7) were purchased from ATCC, USA. MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and Hs578T cells were cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO2 and 95% air in DMEM with 10% FBS. BT549 cells were cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 medium (RPMI-1640) with 10% FBS.Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysisCollected cells and samples were digested in nitric acid (Sigma) and diluted with DDH2O. The ICP-MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to determine the iron content of samples. Iron concentration was normalized to the weight or cells number of each sample. Each experiment was repeated 3 times.Migration assayA 6.5 mm (0.8\u00a0\u03bcm pore size) 24-well transwell chamber system (Corning) was used in Migration assay. 3\u00d7105 Cells were suspended in 100\u00a0\u00b5l serum-free DMEM, and added into the upper chamber. 600\u00a0\u00b5l DMEM with 10% FBS was added into the bottom of 24-wells. After culture at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, cells were co-incubated with DMT1 and TfR1 neutralizing antibody and DFO for 24\u00a0h. The upper chamber was washed with PBS for 10\u00a0s 3 times, and the cells on the on the upper layer of the filter were scrubbed. Then the upper chamber was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u00a0min, and treated with crystal violet for another 15\u00a0min. Images were captured in 5 random fields by an invert Microscope with a 5\u00d7 objective. 33% acetic acid was used to dissolve the migrated cells which were stained by crystal violet. Migrated cells were measured at OD 595\u00a0nm of the eluted crystal violet. All experiments were performed in triplicate.Quantitative RT-PCRCollected 1\u00d7106 cells, and isolation RNA was performed using a Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). Then cDNAs derived from RNA were made by using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa). Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. The forward primer sequences for IL-6 are 5\u2032- TCTCCACAAGCGCCTTCG-3\u2032 and reverse primer sequences for IL-6 are 5\u2032- CTCAGGGCTGAGATGCCG-3\u2032. RT-PCR was completed on the ABI 7900HT sequence detection system, and SDS software (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). All data were normalizations to GAPDH levels, the fold changes were analyzed by the double \u0394Ct method. All experiments were performed in triplicate.Western blotCells were lysed by RIPA. After being shocked and ice-bath for 30\u00a0min, cells were centrifuged for 20\u00a0min at 22,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were collected. Cell membrane protein and cytoplasmic protein were separated using Mem-PERTM Plus Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (Thermo). The concentration of protein was accessed using BCA. 20\u201340\u00a0\u03bcg protein was separated by 8\u201312.5% SDS-PAGE, then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P) using Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). DMT1, IRP1, IRP2, TfR1, TfR2, ferritin, T-PI3K, phospho-PI3K antibodies were obtained from Abcam. T-STAT3 (0.1 mg/ml), phospho-STAT3 tyr705 (1 mg/ml) were acquired from R&D. T-ERK, phospho-ERK, pan-AKT, phospho-AKT (1:1000) were obtained from Cell signaling technology. GAPDH and \u03b2-actin antibodies were purchased from Biotime. After being cultured with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, proteins were cultured with the HRP-labeled secondary antibody (KPL). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). All experiments were performed in triplicate.Immunofluorescence assayCells were grown on coverslips inside 24-wells plates overnight. After being crawled on slides, cells were washed by PBS for 3 times, treated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\u00a0min, and treated in 0.3% Triton-X 100 for 5\u00a0min. After being blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u00a0h, cells were incubated with PBS diluted primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Slides were washed by PBS for 3 times, and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibody protect from light for 1\u00a0h. Nuclear were stained by DAPI. Confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP5) was used to capture images.Cultured with antibody or inhibitorsInhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology) was dissolved in DMSO. Cells were pretreated for 1\u00a0h with or without LY294002 and then co-cultured with or without 200\u00a0\u03bcM DFO for 24\u00a0h. Cells were treated with IL-6, DMT1 or TfR1 neutralizing antibody combined with DFO for 24\u00a0h.Statistical analysisAll results were presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical significance between means was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Multiple comparisons were determined with a least significant difference test. Statistically significant was set at P-value <0.05.ResultsEffects of DFO on the expression of iron metabolism-related proteins in nonaggressive ER\u03b1-positive and aggressive tnbcsEffects of DFO treatment on the expression of iron-uptake and iron-storage proteins in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

In our previous study, we identified that DFO treatment enhanced intracellular iron concentration in aggressive TNBCs leading to enhance cell migration. To address the question why the intracellular iron concentration was increased in aggressive TNBCs after DFO treatment, the expression of iron-uptake and iron-storage proteins, such as DMT1, TfR1, TfR2 and ferritin in non-aggressive ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer MCF-7 cells and aggressive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were determined by western blotting (Figure 1). In the cell lysate, the expression of TfR2 was not changed after 24\u00a0h of DFO treatment in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, as compared with the control group (Figure 1A and C), and on cell membrane, the expression of TfR2 was decreased in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1B and D), which indicated that TfR2 would not have the key role of iron uptake in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. The expression of ferritin was decreased significantly in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells after DFO treatment as compared with the control group, respectively (Figure 1A and C). Interestingly, after 24\u00a0h following DFO treatment, the expression of DMT1 in the cell lysate and on cell membrane was markedly increased in aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells, while they were decreased significantly in non-aggressive MCF-7 cells (Figure 1A\u2013D), which suggested that DMT1 would participate in iron uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells after 24\u00a0h following DFO treatment. Moreover, the protein level of TfR1 was increased in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells after DFO treatment as compared with the control group, respectively (Figure 1A\u2013D). The expression of TfR1, DMT1 and ferritin was further identified by using immunofluorescence staining (Figure 2). All the above results were verified using other breast cancer cell lines such as aggressive triple-negative HS578T cells, BT549 cells and no-aggressive ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer T47D cells (Figures S1\u2013S3). These results indicated that DFO treatment led to different effects on the expression of iron-related proteins between non-aggressive ER\u03b1-positive and aggressive TNBCs. Moreover, we suggested that DFO-increased iron concentration in MDA-MB-231 cells observed in our previous study would be mainly due to the up-regulated expression of TfR1 and DMT1 resulted in enhanced iron uptake under the iron deficient condition induced by DFO.TfR1 and DMT1 enhanced iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs after DFO treatmentTfR1 and DMT1 affected MDA-MB-231 cells migration. (A) Cells were allowed to migrate in transwell assays. MDA-MB-231 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml DMT1 and TfR1 neutralizing antibody, DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, DFO-treated MDA-MB-231cells with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml DMT1 and TfR1 neutralizing antibody, respectively. The images were acquired using an upright microscope with the 10\u00d7 objective. (B) Quantitative analysis of the cell migration was performed by Image Pro Plus software. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.Abbreviations: DFO, deferoxamine; TfR1, transferrin receptor 1; DMT1, divalent metal transporter 1; Ab, antibody; ns, no statistical difference. To ask the question why DFO treatment increased intracellular iron concentration in MDA-MB-231 cells observed in our previous study, we postulated that TfR1 and DMT1 would be related with increasing iron uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells after DFO treatment. To investigate the potential roles of TfR1 and DMT1 in the iron uptake of DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were added with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml DMT1 or TfR1 neutralizing antibody alone, and two neutralizing antibodies together, iron content in DFO-treated or untreated MDA-MB-231 cells were measured by ICP-MS (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3, iron levels in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly increased, as compared with that in untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, there was no difference about iron concentration in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with DMT1, TfR1 neutralizing antibody alone and two neutralizing antibodies. However, the iron concentration was obviously decreased in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with DMT1 or TfR1 neutralizing antibody alone, as compared with DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells respectively. Particularly, the iron concentration was markedly reduced in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with DMT1 and TfR1 neutralizing antibody together. These results were verified using aggressive triple-negative HS578T and BT549 cells (Figure S4). These data indicated that, under normal cell culture condition, DMT1 and TfR1 did not involve in iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs, however, under the iron-deficient condition induced by DFO, DMT1 and TfR1 jointly participated in enhancing iron uptake to increase intracellular iron concentration in aggressive TNBCs. TfR1 and DMT1 enhanced iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs leading to promote cancer cell migration under DFO-induced iron-deficient conditionIL-6 mRNA expression levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were measured using RealTime-qPCR. ***p<0.001.Abbreviations: DFO, deferoxamine; IL-6, interleukin 6.In our previous study, the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells was not significantly changed after 200\u00a0\u03bcM DFO treatment, but the iron levels in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly increased after 200\u00a0\u03bcM DFO treatment leading to increase the expression of mesenchymal markers and promote MDA-MB-231 cell migration. The above results verified that the increased intracellular iron concentration in MDA-MB-231 cells after being treated with DFO was attributed to the increased expression of TfR1 and DMT1. We supposed that inhibiting expression of TfR1 and DMT1 would disturb intracellular iron metabolism, which could affect MDA-MB-231 cells migration. To prove the hypothesis, transwell cell migration assay was performed (Figure 4). The results suggested that the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was promoted after being cultured with DFO for 24\u00a0h, as compared with the untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. However, with the addition of DMT1 and TfR1 neutralizing antibody in untreated MDA-MB-231 cells, cell migration was not obviously affected. Especially, in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with DMT1 and TfR1 neutralizing antibody, cell migration was significantly diminished (Figure 4A and B). The results suggested that DFO treatment enhanced MDA-MB-231 cells migration would be attributed to the up-regulated expression of TfR1 and DMT1 increasing intracellular iron uptake after DFO treatment. These results were verified using aggressive triple-negative HS578T and BT549 cells (Figure S5). Taken together, all these results suggested that TfR1 and DMT1 in aggressive TNBCs could play the vital role of increasing intracellular iron uptake under iron-deficient condition induced by DFO.The expression level of IL-6 was increased in DFO-treated triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cellsThe mechanism for up-regulated expression of TfR1 and DMT1 in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells under the iron-deficient condition induced by DFO was still unknown. Previous reports have indicated that TfR is regulated by the PI3K/AKT pathway. PI3K/AKT pathway can be regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). The secreted IL-6 - IL-6R complex activated MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and JAK/STAT3 pathways. IL-6 is primarily autocrine secreted by highly aggressive TNBCs such as MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T, whereas IL-6 is not expressed in non-aggressive ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB-361, MCF-7, and T47D. Thus we supposed that IL-6/PI3K/AKT signaling in aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells could regulate iron-uptake under DFO-induced iron-deficient condition. The expression level of IL-6 was detected in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and ER\u03b1-positive MCF-7 cells using RT-qPCR (Figure 5). IL-6 mRNA expression level was significantly increased in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, as compared with control MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, IL-6 mRNA level in DFO-treated MCF-7 cells was obviously decreased (Figure 5). The results indicated that DFO treatment could promote expression of IL-6 in aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells under DFO-induced iron-deficient condition.The activated PI3K/AKT pathway enhanced the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 leading to the increased iron uptake in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells after DFO treatmentThe activated PI3K/AKT pathway enhanced the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 leading to increased iron uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells after DFO treatment. (A, B) The expression levels of phosphorylated PI3K, STAT3, ERK, AKT, IRP1 and IRP2 were assessed in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells by western blotting. (C, D) MDA-MB-231 cells were pretreated with or without LY294002 for 1\u00a0h, and treated with or without DFO treatment for 24\u00a0h. Cellular lysates proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. (E, F) With or without LY294002 pretreatment for 1\u00a0h, and with or without DFO treatment for 24\u00a0h, TfR1 and DMT1 from cell membrane were detected by Western blotting. (G) With or without LY294002 pretreatment for 1\u00a0h, and with or without DFO treatment for 24\u00a0h, iron concentration in MDA-MB-231 cells was tested by ICP-MS, respectively. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001.Abbreviations: DFO, deferoxamine; TfR1, transferrin receptor 1; DMT1, divalent metal transporter 1; IRP1, iron regulatory protein1; IRP2, iron regulatory protein 2; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry;\u00a0ns, no statistical difference.Since DFO promoted high expression of IL-6 in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, whether IL-6 could activate PI3K/AKT pathway to regulate iron metabolism in MDA-MB-231 cells following DFO treatment was investigated (Figure 6). The expression of PI3K, and transcription factors, such as STAT3, ERK and AKT were assessed by western blotting. As shown in Figure 6A and B, after DFO treatment for 24\u00a0h, phosphorylated PI3K, AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly increased, but the level of phosphorylated STAT3 was not obviously changed and the level of phosphorylated ERK was decreased, as compared with untreated MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. At the same time, phosphorylated PI3K was markedly decreased in MCF-7 cells after DFO treatment, but phosphorylated STAT3, ERK and AKT level were no difference between DFO-treated MCF-7 cells and untreated MCF-7 cells. And the two iron regulatory protein1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) control iron metabolism proteins expression at the post-transcriptional level. The expression of IRP1 and IRP2 in MDA-MB-231 cells was obviously increased after DFO treatment, while they were decreased in DFO-treated MCF-7 cells. The results suggested that PI3K/AKT/IRPs pathway in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells was activated after DFO treatment.To explore the relationship between PI3K/AKT activation and the expression of iron metabolism-related proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells after exposure to DFO, the inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002 were used to treat MDA-MB-231 cells. After the addition of LY294002 for 1\u00a0h, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with DFO for 24\u00a0h, PI3K/AKT pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells was further verified. As shown in Figure 6C and D, the expression of iron-related proteins, such as IRP1, IRP2, TfR1 and DMT1 were up-regulated in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells as compared with the untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. While when being pretreated with LY294002 for 1\u00a0h and treated with DFO for 24\u00a0h, IRP1, IRP2, TfR1 and DMT1 in MDA-MB-231 cells were down-regulated (Figure 6C and D). The same effect was observed in the expression of iron uptake-related cell membrane proteins such as TfR1 and DMT1 (Figure 6E and F). Next, the iron concentration was detected in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with LY294002 pretreatment (Figure 6G). There was no difference about iron concentrations between MDA-MB-231 cells and LY294002 pretreated MDA-MB-231 cells. After treated with DFO for 24\u00a0h, the iron concentration was significantly increased in MDA-MB-231 cells, as compared with untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. However, the iron concentration was markedly decreased in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with LY294002 pretreatment. Taken together, all of the data demonstrated that DFO treatment could trigger PI3K/AKT/IRPs activation to up-regulate the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 leading to enhance iron uptake in aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.IL-6/PI3K/AKT pathway involved in upregulating the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 leading to enhance iron uptake and promote cell migration in MDA-MB-231 cells after DFO treatmentIL-6/PI3K/AKT pathway involved in upregulating the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 leading to enhance iron uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells after DFO treatment. (A, B) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with or without 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml IL-6 neutralizing antibody, and with or without 200\u00a0\u03bcM DFO for 24\u00a0h. The expression of phosphorylated PI3K and AKT, IRP1, IRP2, TfR1, and DMT1 in MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed by Western blotting. (C, D) After being treated with or without 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml IL-6 neutralizing antibody, and with or without 200\u00a0\u03bcM DFO for 24\u00a0h, TfR1 and DMT1 on cell membrane were detected by Western blotting.

MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured with 200\u00a0\u03bcM DFO and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml IL-6 neutralizing antibody for 24\u00a0h. As shown in Figure 7A and B, there was no obvious difference about the expression of phosphorylated PI3K and AKT, IRP1, IRP2, TfR1 and DMT1 between MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with IL-6 neutralizing antibody, whereas the phosphorylated PI3K and AKT were significantly overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 cells response to DFO treatment. With the addition of IL-6 neutralizing antibody, phosphorylated PI3K, AKT and iron-related proteins, such as IRP1, IRP2, TfR1 and DMT1 in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were obviously decreased as compared with DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells respectively. With the addition of IL-6 neutralizing antibody in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 on the cell membrane (Figure 7C and D) was obviously decreased as compared with the DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells respectively. Next, the iron concentration was detected in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with an IL-6 neutralizing antibody (Figure 7E). There was no difference about iron concentration between MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with IL-6 neutralizing antibody. However, the iron concentration was markedly decreased in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with IL-6 neutralizing antibody as compared with DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. The results identified that DFO treatment could induce IL-6/PI3K/AKT signaling activation to up-regulate the expression of iron-related proteins enhancing iron uptake in aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.To explore that DFO activated IL-6/PI3K/Akt signaling to lead migration in TNBC cells, transwell cell migration assay was performed (Figure S6). The results suggested that the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was promoted after being cultured with DFO for 24\u00a0h, as compared with the untreated MDA-MB-231 cells. With the addition of IL-6 neutralizing antibody in untreated MDA-MB-231 cells, cell migration was not obviously affected. However, in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells with IL-6 neutralizing antibody, cell migration was significantly diminished (Figure S6A and B). Collectively, all these results suggested that DFO activated IL-6/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells up-regulated the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 leading to increasing intracellular iron uptake and enhancing cell migration.DiscussionIn this study, we observed that: 1) DFO treatment significantly increased the expression of the iron uptake proteins, TfR1 and DMT1 in aggressive TNBCs. 2) DFO treatment could promote high expression of IL-6 in aggressive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. 3) The aggressive TNBCs exhibited the activated IL-6/PI3K/AKT signaling to up-regulate the expression of TfR1 and DMT1, leading to increased iron uptake.In our previous study, we originally applied DFO to decrease the iron concentrations in breast cancer cells. However, exposure to DFO significantly enhanced the iron concentrations in aggressive TNBCs. More importantly, the increased intracellular iron concentrations in aggressive TNBCs led to enhance cell migration. But the mechanism of the increased iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs after DFO treatment still remained unclear.Currently, our studies provided the evidence that DFO treatment produced different effects on the expression of iron uptake proteins between non-aggressive ER\u03b1-positive and aggressive TNBCs. TfR1, TfR2 and DMT1 are well-known proteins related to iron uptake in cells. In this study, DMT1 and TfR1 were found to be up-regulated to increase iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs under the iron-deficient condition induced by DFO. Though TfR1 was also up-regulated in ER\u03b1-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells after DFO treatment, the intracellular iron concentration in DFO-treated MCF-7 cells was declined sharply, whether up-regulated expression of TfR1 in DFO-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells was related with iron uptake should be further studied. After DFO treatment, the expression of TfR2 in the cell lysate of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was not changed, and the expression of TfR2 on cell membrane was both decreased, it seems that the major role of TfR2 is sensing intracellular iron levels rather than iron uptake.The iron regulatory proteins IRPs (IRP1 and IRP2) could sense intracellular iron status and regulate the iron homeostasis by binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) of DMT1 and TfR1. Much more abundant IRP1 than IRP2 in variety cells is reported. Similarly, in our study, the expression of IRP1 was up-regulated much higher than IRP2 in DFO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, and the expression of IRP1 and IRP2 in MDA-MB-231 cells was increased via activation of IL-6/PI3K/AKT pathway after DFO treatment, thus we suggested that both IRP1 and IRP2 responded to DFO-induced iron deficiency in mediating the regulation of DMT1 and TfR1.It is noteworthy that iron metabolism pathways are closely related to inflammatory stressors. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) or IL-6 influence the posttranscriptional control of iron homeostasis by modulating the binding affinity of IRP1 and IRP2 to IREs in human monocytic cells and neuron cells. However, the role of IL-6 in mediating iron uptake in tumor cells remained to be elucidated. Under the iron deficient condition induced by DFO, triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells were triggered to up-regulate the expression level of IL-6, but the situation in ER\u03b1-positive MCF-7 cells was just on the contrary. As an inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 is higher expressed in highly aggressive TNBCs, whereas is almost not expressed in non-aggressive ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, IL-6 were associated with iron homeostasis. After DFO treatment, the activation of IL-6/PI3K/AKT pathway led to increase expression of IRP1 and IRP2 in MDA-MB-231 cells. IRPs regulates TfR1 and DMT1 mRNA stability, ultimately increasing protein levels of TfR1 and DMT1 to promote iron uptake in TNBC cells.The present results were suggested that IL-6 involved in iron uptake through the activated PI3K/AKT pathway under the iron-deficient condition induced by DFO. In this study, we suggested that both TfR1 and DMT1 were involved in increasing iron uptake in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells under DFO-induced iron-deficient condition, but the intracellular iron transport and iron storage remained unsolved. The further studies were in process to elucidate the route of the intracellular iron transport, and intracellular iron storage in aggressive TNBCs under the iron-deficient condition induced by DFO.Collectively, our study suggested that aggressive TNBCs exhibited the activated IL-6/PI3K/AKT signaling to up-regulate the expression of TfR1 and DMT1 leading to increased iron uptake under the iron-deficient condition induced by DFO. Our study also suggested that when DFO was applied to treat breast cancer cells, it should be considered that DFO has different effects on iron metabolism in breast cancer cells with different phenotype leading to distinct biological outcomes.DisclosureThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.ReferencesDietary iron intake and breast cancer risk: modulation by an antioxidant supplementationLevels of zinc, selenium, calcium, and iron in benign breast tissue and risk of subsequent breast cancerA probable risk factor of female breast cancer: study on benign and malignant breast tissue samplesRecent advances on the stimulatory effects of metals in breast cancerRole of ferritin alterations in human breast cancer cellsIron homeostasis in breast cancerIron homeostasis and anemia markers in early breast cancerLocal iron homeostasis in the breast ductal carcinoma microenvironmentCellular iron metabolism in prognosis and therapy of breast cancerEffect of dietary iron deficiency or excess on the induction of mammary carcinogenesis by 1-methyl-1-nitrosoureaIron enhances tumor growth.

Conclusion The current study identified CAF subtypes based on gene expression profiles and found that CAF subtypes have significantly different overall survival, immune cells, and immunotherapy response rates.1. IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

        "content": "Tetraspanins are transmembrane adaptor proteins involved in the regulation of various fundamental cellular processes. For a number of malignant diseases, the level of expression of members of the tetraspanin family was found to correlate with tumor cell invasiveness, ability to form metastases, and poor clinical outcome. We describe the exact quantification of mRNAs coding for the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD82 and CD151 expressed by mammary carcinoma-derived cell lines that were classified as invasive or non-invasive according to their ability to penetrate collagen-fibroblast gels in vitro. The mean of beta2-microglobulin-normalized expression of CD9 was about 10-fold higher than the mean calculated for CD63 and about 20-fold higher than expression of CD82 and CD151. Direct comparison of tetraspanin expression of invasive and non-invasive cell lines with the Mann-Whitney test revealed a significant correlation for CD63. Grouping of cell lines in relation to threshold values of expression resulted in significant correlations for CD63 (Fisher's exact test p=0.004) and CD151 (p=0.02) but not for CD82 (p=0.065) and CD9 (p=0.168). Expression of CD9, C63 and CD151 was found to be coupled whereas CD82 was expressed independently. This highly significant association points to common mechanisms of gene regulation for this subgroup of tetraspanins. We showed that on basis of absolute amounts of tetraspanin mRNAs, at least in vitro invasiveness is clearly predictable. Our results support the assumption that downregulation of tetraspanins in breast cancer cells is an important step of tumor progression to more malignant phenotypes and underline their important role as mediators in multimolecular membrane protein complexes regulating cell adhesion and migration.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

        "content": "Carcinomas are complex tissues comprised of neoplastic cells and a non-cancerous compartment referred to as the 'stroma'. The stroma consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a variety of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes and leukocytes (1-3). The tumour-associated stroma is responsive to substantial paracrine signals released by neighbouring carcinoma cells. During the disease process, the stroma often becomes populated by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) including large numbers of myofibroblasts. These cells have previously been extracted from many different types of human carcinomas for their in vitro culture. A subpopulation of CAFs is distinguishable through their up-regulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression(4,5). These cells are a hallmark of 'activated fibroblasts' that share similar properties with myofibroblasts commonly observed in injured and fibrotic tissues (6). The presence of this myofibroblastic CAF subset is highly related to high-grade malignancies and associated with poor prognoses in patients. Many laboratories, including our own, have shown that CAFs, when injected with carcinoma cells into immunodeficient mice, are capable of substantially promoting tumourigenesis (7-10). CAFs prepared from carcinoma patients, however, frequently undergo senescence during propagation in culture limiting the extensiveness of their use throughout ongoing experimentation. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a novel technique to experimentally generate immortalised human mammary CAF cell lines (exp-CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts, using a coimplantation breast tumour xenograft model. In order to generate exp-CAFs, parental human mammary fibroblasts, obtained from the reduction mammoplasty tissue, were first immortalised with hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme, and engineered to express GFP and a puromycin resistance gene. These cells were coimplanted with MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells expressing an activated ras oncogene (MCF-7-ras cells) into a mouse xenograft. After a period of incubation in vivo, the initially injected human mammary fibroblasts were extracted from the tumour xenografts on the basis of their puromycin resistance (11). We observed that the resident human mammary fibroblasts have differentiated, adopting a myofibroblastic phenotype and acquired tumour-promoting properties during the course of tumour progression. Importantly, these cells, defined as exp-CAFs, closely mimic the tumour-promoting myofibroblastic phenotype of CAFs isolated from breast carcinomas dissected from patients. Our tumour xenograft-derived exp-CAFs therefore provide an effective model to study the biology of CAFs in human breast carcinomas. The described protocol may also be extended for generating and characterising various CAF populations derived from other types of human carcinomas.",

        "content": "Recent advances indicate that cancer\u2011associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a key role in cancer progression by contributing to invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Solid tumors often experience low oxygen tension environments, which induce gene expression changes and biological features leading to poor outcomes. The G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER) exhibits a stimulatory role in diverse types of cancer cells and in CAFs under hypoxic conditions. We investigated the role of CAFs and hypoxia in breast cancer aggressiveness, and examined the effect of GPER in CAFs on hypoxia-driven breast cancer progression. The results showed that hypoxia upregulated HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs, and induced the secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in CAFs. However, GPER silencing abrogated the above hypoxia-driven cytokine expression in CAFs. Moreover, knockdown of GPER in CAFs suppressed breast cancer cell invasion induced by CAF conditioned media (CM). Furthermore, GPER silencing in CAFs inhibited hypoxia-increased CTGF expression in CAFs and breast cancer cells cultured with CM from CAFs under hypoxic conditions. In addition, CTGF is responsible for the observed effects of GPER on CAFs activation and breast cancer invasion. Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression. ",

IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The SUM-159 human triple negative cell line was obtained from Asterand Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA) and was cultured in HAMS:F12 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone 1% HEPES. The MCF7 luminal A human breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 10% FBS. Cell lines were authenticated via third party testing (IDEXX BioAnalytics, Columbia, MO, USA) between October 2018 and October 2019. The MCF10A cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 5% FBS + 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was obtained from Dr. Ann Chambers (London Health Science Centre, London, Canada) and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS. The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and bone marrow (BM) was immediately extracted and stained with primary anti-CD117-PE and anti-CD45-FITC antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Supplemental Figure S2. Cells (10,000/sample) were analyzed to assess differences in CD117+ cells within the total BM population. (a\u2013d) Representative flow cytometry histograms of the CD117+ BMDC population (gate F2) in (a) age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (controls for SUM159); (b) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice; (c) age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (controls for MCF7) and (d) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice. (e) Compiled flow cytometry data for all groups (n = 15 mice/group). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. \u03b1 = significantly different from respective age-matched controls. \u03b2 = significantly different from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.05).Mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary breast tumors had no evidence of lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and either formalin-fixed or snap-frozen. (a\u2013g) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and stained with (a\u2013c) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or (e\u2013g) subjected to immunohistochemistry with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification for the presence of metastatic tumor cells (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a,e) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (b,f) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (c,g) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice.

        "content": "The cellular components of microenvironment are partners of cancer cells, sharing soluble factors and organic molecules to accomplish tumor energy and biomass demands. We tested the role of fibroblasts in fatty acids metabolism in breast cancer, addressing fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression and activity, the expression of lipids chaperons (FABPs) and transporters (FATPs) and lipids cellular content. We showed that the amount of lipids increased in cancer cells exposed to fibroblasts conditioned media, showing that lipids transfer is crucial in this metabolic cross-talk. Accordingly, it was seen in those cancer cells a concomitant decrease in the expression of FABP2 and FABP3 and an increase in FATP1 expression, whose function is independent of FABPs. The in\u00a0vivo experiment corroborates the role of CAFs in tumor growth. Our study is one more step toward the understanding of metabolic dynamics between cancer cells and CAFs, disclosing FATP1 as a putative target to disturb the transfer of lipids between CAFs and breast cancer cells.",

        "content": "Tumor stroma has been recently shown to play a crucial role in the development of breast cancer. Since the origin of the stromal cells in the tumor is unknown, we have examined differences and similarities between three stromal cell types of mesenchymal origin, namely carcinoma associated fibroblasts from breast tumor (CAFs), fibroblasts from normal breast area (NFs) and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). In a microarray analysis, immunological, developmental and extracellular matrix -related pathways were over-represented in CAFs when compared to NFs (p&lt;0.001). Under hypoxic conditions, the expression levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) were lower in CAFs when compared to NFs (fold changes 0.6 and 0.4, respectively). In normoxia, when compared to NFs, CAFs displayed increased expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and PDK1 (fold changes 1.5 and 1.3, respectively). With respect to the assessed surface markers, only CD105 was expressed differently in MSCs when compared to fibroblasts, being more often expressed on MSCs. Cells with myofibroblast features were present in both NF and CAF samples. We conclude, that CAFs differ distinctly from NFs at the gene expression level, this hypothesis was also tested in silico for other available gene expression data.",

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

        "content": "Human breast tumors are often associated with a fibrotic reaction termed desmoplasia. Tumor cells may indirectly modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by influencing fibroblast properties. They may also directly interact with collagen fibrils leading to retraction of the matrix. We have studied in vitro the influence of various human mammary tumor cells on the proliferation rate of normal human fibroblasts and on their level of collagen synthesis, as well as their release of collagenase activity. Interactions between neoplastic cells and collagen matrix were investigated by incorporation of tumor cells in collagen gels (lattices) and measurement of their retraction. All cells tested (HBL100, SW613, SA52, MDA-MB-231, MCF7, MCF7/6, MCF7 ras, BT20 and T47D) were able to modulate the composition of the extracellular matrix by one or several of the mechanisms investigated. Our results also demonstrate an opposite regulation of collagen and collagenase production. The effects on the collagen metabolism and on fibroblast proliferation are probably mediated by soluble cytokines since they are reproduced by incubating the fibroblasts in the presence of medium conditioned by tumor cells. The desmoplastic reaction may thus result from different mechanisms dependent upon tumor cell types.",

Antibodies that block IFN receptors reduced CAF-dependent chemoprotection.ConclusionsCAF-induced activation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBCs results in chemoresistance. Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women. The expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)\u2014that are collectively named hormone receptors (HR)\u2014human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and of the proliferation marker, Ki67, defines BC subtypes which are categorized into: Lumina A (HR+, HER2-), Luminal B (HR+, HER2+ or HR+, HER2-; Ki67 high), HER2-enriched (HR-, HER2+), and Triple-Negative (TN: HR-, HER2-). The majority of TNBCs belongs to the basal-like subtype and displays a highly aggressive phenotype with poorer overall survival and high relapse rates. Although TNBC can show an initial good response to chemotherapies, it frequently develops resistance and, due to the limitations of available targeted therapies, it still represents a deadly disease.The association between inflammation and cancer is unquestionable since chronic inflammation frequently predisposes cells to oncogenic transformation. A key mediator of the anti-inflammatory response is the 37 kDa phospholipid-binding protein Annexin A1 (AnxA1). In addition to regulating membrane trafficking, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, AnxA1 inhibits Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the cytoplasm and impedes the release of arachidonic acid, which is a key contributor to the development of the tumor microenvironment (TME). AnxA1 also elicits, upon its secretion, the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) signaling pathway that is responsible for inhibiting leukocyte adhesion and migration. Therefore, AnxA1 is a pleiotropic protein with effects beyond the immune system and is implicated in the promotion and progression of different diseases.In the last decade, researchers have focused on the correlation between AnxA1 and the aggressiveness of different tumors. In BC context, higher expression levels of AnxA1 have been described for the TNBC subtype and the role of this protein in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC has also been depicted. AnxA1 can be found in cytoplasm, nuclei and supernatants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB231, in its 37 kDa intact form and in its cleaved form of 33 kDa. Notably, findings showed that the intact form displays anti-inflammatory activity while its cleaved form seems to be pro-inflammatory. Interestingly, previous works showed an association between AnxA1 and the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6. On one side, it has been demonstrated that IL-6 stimulates the upregulation and secretion of AnxA1 by acting on an IL-6 responsive region within the AnxA1 promoter. On the other side, it has been demonstrated that AnxA1 signaling through FPR2 inhibits the IL-6 expression in neutrophils and that AnxA1 signaling through FPR1 inhibits the IL-6 expression in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231.IL-6 is one of the main mediators of the inflammatory response with an important role in host immune defense mechanisms and in the modulation of cellular growth. IL-6 signals through a cell-surface receptor, the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and through a soluble form of IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), leading to the activation of the transcription factor STAT3. IL-6 modulates the proliferation and differentiation of malignant cells and its expression is frequently increased in different tumors including prostate cancer and BC. In BC, the overexpression of both IL-6 and IL-6 receptors (IL-6R and sIL-6R) was observed and high serum levels of IL-6 have been correlated with a poorer prognosis and metastasis to bones. Moreover, the IL-6 expression levels are significantly higher in the basal-like BC phenotype and in multi drug-resistant cancer cell lines. Similar findings were observed for STAT3 whose overexpression levels correlate with poorer survival rates in patients with solid tumors and with the resistance of cancer cells towards chemotherapy. In BC, STAT3 stimulates proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, chemoresistance and promotes EMT and metastasis.In this work, we describe the functional interaction between AnxA1 and IL-6 in BC and unravel how this interaction could maintain the malignant phenotype of TNBCs. By using tissue microarrays (TMAs) and BC cell lines, we observed that AnxA1 expression correlates with the expression of IL-6. TNBC cells are characterized for high levels of both AnxA1 and IL-6 and for the activation of an autocrine signaling by AnxA1. We found that IL-6 increased AnxA1 externalization and, in this way, supported the AnxA1 autocrine signaling cascade through the activation of FPR1 in TNBC cell lines. When FPR1 was inhibited in TNBC cells, the expression levels of IL-6 were increased as an attempt to sustain the autocrine signaling of AnxA1. We also demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor, Tocilizumab (TCZ), inhibited the in vivo growth of MDA-MB-231 tumors in mice, reducing metastasis formation. Lastly, supernatants derived from MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells previously treated with inhibitors of FPR1 and/or IL-6 influenced the motility of fibroblast cells. Taken together, our data suggest that in aggressive BCs, the AnxA1 and IL-6 signaling pathway cascades are linked by a biunivocal compensatory relation.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Culture and TreatmentsThe non-tumorigenic human breast cell line, MCF-10A, and the human BC cell lines, MCF-7 (ER+, PR+), MDA-MB-453 (HER2+), MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT-459 (TNBC cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All the BC cell lines were cultured in IMDM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dallas, TX, USA) while MCF-10A cells were cultured in DMEM F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with EGF (20 ng/mL), hydrocortisone (0.5 \u00b5g/mL), cholera toxin (100 ng/mL), and insulin (10 \u00b5g/mL) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fibroblast cells (HFF) were cultured in RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All media were supplemented with 10% of Fetal Bovine Serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1\u00d7 antibiotic-Antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All cells were free from mycoplasma and were authenticated through STR analysis.Cells were treated with the following chemicals and antibodies diluted in serum-free medium: FPR antagonist Cyclosporin H (CsH-Sigma, used at 1 \u00b5M), neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody (Tocilizumab Actemra, Roche, used at 2 \u00b5g/mL), STATTIC (STC-Sigma 1 and 5 \u00b5M) and recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6, Thermo Fisher Scientific, used at 1 \u00b5g/mL).2.2. Cell Lysis and ImmunoblottingNuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts of 24 h-treated cells were prepared by using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce\u2122 BCA\u2122 ProteinAssay; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Identical amounts of protein extracts and supernatants were separated electrophoretically on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Membranes were blocked with PBS 5% milk for 1 h and subsequently incubated with anti-AnxA1 (1:2000; 71-3400; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Anti-\u03b2-Actin (1:1000, SC-130656; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and anti-Lamin B2 (1:1000, SAB2702205, Sigma) were used as loading controls of cytoplasmic and nuclear extract, respectively. As a secondary antibody, the anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (1:3000; G21234; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used.2.3. Flow CytometryTo analyze the activation of ERK1/2 and STAT3 and the expression levels of FPR1 and FPR2, cells were fixed and permeabilized by BD Cytofix/Cytoperm\u2122 Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA). Subsequently, cells were stained with anti-ERK1 (1:100; (phospho T202/Y204) + ERK2 (phospho T185/Y187); ab32538, Abcam)); anti-STAT3 (1:100; phospho Y705 AF4607; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA); anti-FPR1 FITC-conjugated (1:50; FAB3744F; R&D Systems); and anti-FPR2 PE-conjugated (1:50; FAB3479P; R&D Systems). Anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:200, 656111, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a secondary antibody for ERK1/2 and STAT3 staining. The isotype controls for FPR1 ((anti-mouse IgG2A-FITC control) 1:50; IC003F; R&D Systems) and FPR2 ((anti-mouse IgG2B-PE control) 1:50; IC0041P, R&D Systems) were also used.2.4. Calcium FluxIn order to assess the intracellular calcium increase, cells were treated for 24 h with STC, TCZ, CsH, or rIL-6. The next day, cells were treated for an additional hour, washed with Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), and incubated with a mixture of the Fluo4 AM calcium dye and Pluronic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in the dark. Cells were washed twice with HBSS to remove the unloaded dye. A standard curve of calcium was prepared in HBSS buffer without calcium. The cytosolic calcium in samples was measured by using a fluorescence microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA, USA) using excitation.2.5. ImmunohistochemistryTissue microarray (TMA) slides containing samples of 1 mm diameter and 1 \u00b5M thickness of BC primary tumors (US Biomax BR1503d) were used. All samples were clinicopathologically characterized according to Scarff Bloom-Richardson grading, TNM staging system and ER, PR and HER2 status.TMA slides were incubated for 16 h with anti-IL-6 (Thermoscientific AHC0762) or anti-AnxA1 (71-3400; Thermoscientific) at 1:20 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively, and subsequently incubated with Novolink\u2122 Max Polymer Detection System (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK) with HRP polymer (HRP Multimer). Next, the reactions were developed with diaminobenzidine substrate solution (DAB, Sigma). The slides were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Dinamica Quimica Comtemporanea, Indaiatuba, SP, Brazil), mounted on Tissue-Tek film (Sakura), and digitalized by using the Aperio ScanScope XT digital scanner (Leyca Biosystems, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using the PixelCount V9.0 algorithm.2.6. In Vivo AssayThe Ethics Committee of the Institutional Research Board of the AC Camargo Cancer Center approved all procedures involving mice, under the number 072/2015. All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.Female athymic nude mice (2\u20134 months old) were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 \u00d7 106 MDA-MB-231-Luc cells. After tumors reached 300 mm3, animals were randomized into two groups. The treatments were carried out intraperitoneally with PBS + DMSO 5% (group control, n = 11) or with TCZ 10 mg/kg (n = 7) three times a week for 1 month or if tumors reached 1000 mm3. After treatments, tumors were resected, and metastases were monitored in vivo by whole animal imaging with bioluminescence (IN-VIVO FX Pro, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA).2.7. Wound-Healing AssayCell migration was measured by in vitro wound-healing assay. Briefly, by using a pipette tip, wounds on HFF cell monolayers were created. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and treated with mitomycin C (Sigma, used at 10 \u00b5g/mL) to inhibit mitosis. Afterwards, cells were treated with supernatants of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells not treated or treated with 1 \u00b5M CsH, 2 \u00b5g/mL of TCZ, 5 \u00b5M STC and 1 \u00b5g/mL of rIL-6. Pictures of the wounds (10\u00d7) were taken at times 0 and 24 h (EVOS, AMG). By comparing the gap at times 0 and 24 h, the percentages of gap closure were obtained.2.8. ELISAIL-6 expression was analyzed by ELISA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in supernatants from the human BC cell lines. TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were treated or not for 24 h with STC, TCZ, CsH or rIL-6 in serum-free medium.2.9. Quantitative Real-Time PCRTotal RNAs from the breast cell lines were extracted using Trizol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The RNA concentration and quality were analyzed spectrophotometrically by absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm, and 1 \u03bcg was used to synthesize cDNA using GoScript Reverse Transcription Mix, Oligo(dT) (Promega; Madison, WI, USA), following the supplier\u2019s instructions.The real-time PCR (qPCR) was conducted in an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 5.0 \u03bcL of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5 \u03bcM of primers designed for ANXA1 (5\u2032-GATTCAGATGCCAGGGCCT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATCCACAACTTCGCAGAGTG-3\u2032), IL-6 (5\u2032-AACCACGGCCTTCCCTACTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAGTTGTGCAATGGCAATTCTG-3\u2032) and STAT3 (5\u2032-CCAGTTTACCACGAAAGTCAGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AAAGACTCTGGGGATGTTGCTG-3\u2032). Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene was used as reference for relative quantification and the primers were published previously. Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 60 s. Each sample was tested in triplicate and mRNA relative levels were calculated using the \u0394\u0394Cq method. \u03b22M mRNA levels did not differ across samples.2.10. AnxA1 KnockdownLentiviral particles encoding a scrambled shRNA sequence (1.0 \u00d7 105 IFU; shControl, sc-108080, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a pool of lentiviral particles encoding four shRNAs specific for AnxA1 knockdown (1.0 \u00d7 105 IFU; shAnxA1, sc-29198, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were transduced in MDA-MB-231 cells through a previous incubation with Polybrene at 5 \u03bcg/mL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by infection with the virus particles. Clones of cells expressing the shAnxA1 were selected by using 5 \u03bcg/mL of puromycin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).2.11. Statistical AnalysisThe Student\u2019s t test was used to analyze significant differences between means. Correlations were calculated by Pearson\u2019s coefficient, McNemar test and Odds ratios (OR). OR with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Statistical significance was considered when p < 0.05. The statistical analyses were performed by using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS; Chicago, IL, USA).3. Results3.1. Correlation between AnxA1 and IL-6 Expression in BC SamplesA total of 106 patients were included in this study. The patients\u2019 average age was 50.8 years, ranging from 28 to 80 years. ER was expressed in 41 (38.7%) patients, PR was expressed in 28 patients (26.4%), and HER2 was expressed in 39 patients (36.8%). In addition, breast tumors were classified according to their molecular subtypes: 37 Luminal A (35%), 11 Luminal B (10.4%), 26 HER2-enriched (24.5%); and 32 patients were defined as TNBC (30.1%). No axillary lymph node involvement was observed in 37 patients (34.9%), while in 69 patients, one or two (N1-2) lymph node metastases were identified (65.1%). The distribution based on tumor size was as follows: T1, 6 (5.7%); T2, 73 (68.9%); T3, 19 (17.9%) and T4, 8 (7.5%). The distribution by stage was stage I, 3 patients (2.8%); stage II, 73 (68.9%); and stage III, 30 (28.3%). For histological grading of tumors, 11 samples (10.4%) were GI; 82 (77.3%) GII, and 13 (12.3%) GIII.Samples have been analyzed for the expression of AnxA1 and IL-6 and as a control of the staining a TNBC sample has been incubated with all reagents but no primary antibody (Figure S1). We found that in adjacent non-tumor breast tissues, both AnxA1 and IL-6 were expressed in glandular and in the myoepithelial cell layer. AnxA1 and IL-6 were weakly expressed in the Luminal subtype, while moderately expressed in the HER2-enriched subtype and highly expressed in the TNBC subtype (Figure 1A). We also found a positive correlation using the Person\u2019s test and linear regression between AnxA1 and IL-6 (Figure 1B; R = 0.98 and R2 = 0.96 and p > 0.00001).In order to differentiate the expression of AnxA1 and IL-6 proteins according to clinicopathological data, samples were categorized into two groups (high and low) and analyzed using the Odds ratio test. With the aid of the pathologist\u2019s visual score, we chose Iavg (Iavg: average intensity of all pixels) cut-off of 166.7 for IL-6 and 175.0 for AnxA1. The AnxA1 expression was 3.3 higher in TNBC when compared to other subtypes (Table 1; OR = 3.3; p = 0.007). Already, the IL-6 expression was lower in samples classified as N1 and N2 (Table 1; OR = 0.3; p = 0.003) and IL-6 was 2.6-fold less expressed in BC samples when they were not classified as Luminal A (Table 1; OR = 2.6; p = 0.03).To conclude, it was possible to infer that the AnxA1 expression positively correlates with the IL-6 expression (R2 = 0.96 and p < 0.00001). Moreover, the AnxA1 and IL-6 expression negatively correlated with the Luminal A subtype, and the AnxA1 expression was higher in the TN subtype (Table 1).3.2. TNBC Cell Lines Express High Levels of AnxA1 and IL-6The expression of AnxA1 and its receptors, FPR1 and FPR2, was assessed in a non-tumorigenic breast cell line (MCF-10A), in ER-positive BC cell line (MCF-7), in HER2-positive cell line (MDA-MB-453), and TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT-459). As previously described, the AnxA1 protein is expressed in the cytoplasm, nuclei and supernatants of MCF-10A cells. Lower levels of AnxA1 were detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells and were undetectable in supernatants of these lineages. The TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 and BT-459 displayed an intense expression of AnxA1 in the cytoplasm, nuclei, and supernatants (Figure 2A,B). Either in the cytoplasm or nuclei, it was possible to visualize AnxA1 in its intact form (37 kDa) and in its cleaved form (33 kDa). In the supernatants of TNBC cells, AnxA1 was abundantly expressed in its cleaved form. Figure S2 shows a whole membrane staining to demonstrate the specificity of antibodies and proper cell fractionation. Regarding FPRs expression, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells did not express either FPR1 or FPR2; MCF-10A cells expressed both FPR1 and FPR2, whereas MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 and BT-459 cells expressed FPR1 only (Figure 2C).We next analyzed the expression of IL-6 and the activation of STAT3 in the BC cell lines used in this study. We found that MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and BT459 cells secrete high amounts of IL-6 in the extracellular milieu, while IL-6 expression levels in MCF10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-453 cells were undetectable (Figure 3A). The levels of activation of STAT3 (STAT3pY705) were similar among all cell lines (Figure 3B,C), except for BT-549, which expressed lower levels of STAT3pY705. In order to assess whether the IL-6 expression was responsible for the activation of the STAT3 pathway in TNBC cells, we inhibited or activated the IL-6 signaling in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, by using TCZ or a rIL-6, respectively. As a control, we used cells treated with the vehicle only and cells treated with the inhibitor of STAT3, STC. As expected, STC inhibited the activation of STAT3 as visualized by the decrease in STAT3pY705 levels. TCZ significantly impaired STAT3 phosphorylation, while in cells treated with rIL-6, an increase in STAT3 activation levels was observed (Figure 3D).Taken together, these results showed that there is a concordance in the expression of AnxA1 and IL-6 in the supernatant of all the BC cell lines studied. Moreover, higher levels of both molecules were observed in the cytoplasm, nuclei, and supernatant of TNBC cells. On the contrary, STAT3 activation levels are similar among cell lines, except for BT-549. We, therefore, showed that the IL-6 signaling pathway might be of the mechanisms that activate STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 TNBC cells.3.3. AnxA1 Autocrine Signaling Leads to a Decrease in IL-6 ExpressionAs we previously described, the N-terminal peptide of AnxA1 induces an autocrine signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells. In order to confirm the AnxA1 autocrine signaling in MDA-MB-157 cells, this lineage was treated with CsH and the effect on IL-6 expression, on ERK1/2 phosphorylation and on cytosolic calcium, and was compared with MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 4A), as well as cytosolic calcium concentration, were inhibited by CsH in MDA-MB-157 cells at a similar extent to what was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, the inhibition of FPR1 by CsH increased IL-6 secretion in both cell lines (Figure 4C). We next compared, by Western blotting analysis, the effect of CsH on AnxA1 expression on the two TN cell lines. Again, the behavior was similar, since CsH slightly decreased the nuclear localization of AnxA1 while significantly increasing the secretion of AnxA1 in both cell lines (Figure 4D). As previously described, by knocking down AnxA1 in MDA-MB-231, it was possible to observe an increase in the secretion of IL-6. In accordance with the increased levels of IL-6 in the supernatant of cells treated with CsH, the levels of STAT3pY705 were also upregulated after treatment (Figure 4E).Based on these results, we further sought to test whether this increase in IL-6 could be, indeed, elicited in order to increase AnxA1 secretion and its signaling through FPR1. Then, we treated MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cell lines with rIL-6, with a neutralizing antibody anti-human IL-6 (TCZ), and with an inhibitor of the IL-6 signaling pathway, STAT3 (STC). An increase in AnxA1 secretion was observed upon treating cells with rIL-6 (Figure 5A), while the treatment with either TCZ or STC inhibited AnxA1 secretion in both cell lines (Figure 5B,C). Taken together, these results suggest that the IL-6 signaling pathway is important in TNBC cells to stimulate the secretion of AnxA1.The activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and cytosolic calcium levels were also recorded. By analyzing the ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels by flow cytometry, we observed an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon treating cells with rIL-6 and, in contrast, we found that the treatment with either TCZ or STC was highly effective in inhibiting ERK1/2 activation (Figure 6A). Likewise, treatment with rIL-6 stimulated cytosolic calcium levels and either TCZ or STC decreased cytosolic calcium concentrations (Figure 6B).These results demonstrated that IL-6 signaling is one of the mechanisms responsible for the activation of ERK1/2 and cytosolic calcium rise. We also observed that when the AnxA1 autocrine signaling is inhibited, there is an increase in the expression and autocrine signaling of IL-6. This raise in IL-6 represents a compensatory mechanism that TNBC cells activate in order to stimulate the AnxA1 autocrine signaling.3.4. IL-6 Inhibition Is Involved in Tumor GrowthRegarding the evidence that IL-6 signaling elicits the AnxA1/FPR1 axis leading in TNBC cells, we tested the in vivo effect of this receptor inhibition on tumor growth and fibroblast migration. The analysis of fibroblast migration under the influence of IL-6 present in supernatants of TNBC cells aims to find out the possible involvement of this cytokine in the establishment/remodeling of TME. Female nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumors were treated with a control solution (PBS + DMSO 5%) or TCZ three times a week for one month while monitoring the primary tumor and metastasis. Figure 7A shows tumor growth over time. It was possible to observe that TCZ completely arrests tumor growth in a statistically significant manner (p < 0.001; Paired t-test). Figure 7B illustrates in vivo bioluminescence imaging of a tumor relapse and distal metastasis.MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells were treated with a rIL-6, CsH, TCZ, and with STC, and the supernatants were used to treat HFF cells (Figure 7C). Fibroblasts migrated more rapidly in the presence of the supernatant from TNBC cells treated with rIL-6. The treatments with CsH, STC, and TCZ decreased migration properties when compared to their control cells. Indeed, CsH, as a FPR antagonist, inhibits AnxA1 signaling. Therefore, the inhibition of FPR1 and IL-6 modulated the motility of fibroblasts, and it can be considered an important factor for the TME. Even though CsH increases IL-6 that in turn increases secreted AnxA1, AnxA1 cannot signal through FPR1. Finally, the supernatants derived from the MDA-MB-231 cell line stably knocked down for AnxA1 (Figure S3) were used to evaluate the motility of HFF (Figure 7D). Quantifications of gap closures are reported in Figure S4.4. DiscussionBC molecular classification is based primarily on the expression of ER, PR and HER2. This classification, in addition to improving diagnosis, drives targeted therapies such as hormonal therapy (e.g., Tamoxifen and Aromatase inhibitor) and HER2-targeted therapy (e.g., Trastuzumab). TNBC is the most aggressive BC subtype, displaying the worst prognosis and being responsible for a high incidence of metastases and low survival in patients with BC.AnxA1 is a 37-kDa calcium-dependent phospholipid-linked protein that acts in the anti-inflammatory process and immune response. It is a downstream mediator of the actions of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids in cells. Many studies have shown that an increased expression of AnxA1 in TNBC and higher levels of AnxA1 have been observed in patients with familial BC, associated with the BRCA1/2 mutation, poorly differentiated lesions, and with younger patients. Furthermore, the AnxA1 expression was higher in lymph node metastases compared to primary tumors and correlates with BC aggressiveness. AnxA1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei and is secreted into the extracellular medium of TNBC cells, where it elicits an autocrine loop through its receptor, FPR1. Such autocrine signaling is essential in TNBC cell migration and invasion, thus, promoting metastases formation.IL-6 is involved in immune regulation, inflammation, and oncogenesis. In previous studies, higher IL-6 levels were found to be important for TNBC tumor growth and metastases, and serum IL-6 levels increased with pathological grades. IL-6 binds to its receptor complex (IL-6R), inducing the dimerization of glycoprotein 130 (gp130) to promote the signal transducer and activation of STAT3 through the phosphorylation of Tyrosine 705. STAT3 is highly expressed and constitutively activated in TNBC cells, regulating the expression of their downstream target genes, promoting proliferation and tumor aggressiveness. IL-6/STAT3 signaling has been associated with tumor progression in BC and lung cancer by inducing EMT and angiogenesis. Herein, we showed that the IL-6 expression was higher in TNBC samples and TNBC cell lines and higher levels of IL-6 correlated with higher levels of AnxA1. In our work, besides confirming the existence of an autocrine signaling of AnxA1 in TNBC, we demonstrated that IL-6 activates this pathway. Indeed, we observed that the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway was responsible for inducing the secretion of AnxA1 and the subsequent activation of the AnxA1/FPR1 autocrine axis.According to previous studies, TNBC cells secrete autocrine IL-6 and are less responsive to paracrine IL-6 signaling, thus, these cells are less dependent on TME-derived IL-6. This exposure to IL-6 leads to the chronic induction of STAT3pY705, which promotes further growth and invasion of breast tumor cells. TME is composed of signaling molecules from extracellular matrix elements (ECM), endothelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and immune and inflammatory cells, which together play an important role in growth and invasion. Fibroblast cells in TME provide support for the migration, through the bloodstream, of cancer cells, contributing to metastasis. TNBC is enriched with CAFs, which, in turn, contribute to immunosuppression. In our study, we suggest that the interaction between the AnxA1 and IL-6 signaling pathways could be involved in the establishment of a tumor-promoting microenvironment. Indeed, when we treated HFF cells with the supernatants of AnxA1 or IL-6-inhibited TNBC cells, it resulted in a decreased migration. This result suggests that the IL-6 pathway could be involved in TME formation and the subsequent promotion of tumor progression due to its role in increasing the AnxA1 secretion. Secreted AnxA1, besides activating an autocrine loop in TNBC cells, could elicit signaling pathways in fibroblast, promoting the migration of this cell type. Probably due to this effect in promoting TME, we observed that TCZ suppressed TNBC growth in vivo. Our results are in line with Karakasheva et al., which demonstrated that TCZ suppresses tumor growth in vivo in part via the inhibition of STAT3 and MEK/ERK signaling, and IL-6 mediates the crosstalk between tumor cells and activated fibroblasts in TME. In another study, IL-6 modulated the immune status of TME, increasing the antitumor effector function of CD8 + T cells and IL12 production by CD11c + dendritic cells, leading to increased metastatic colonization of colorectal cancer cells. In the cancer context, it is known that the IL-6 is responsible to promote tissue invasion, EMT, acute-phase proteins and Th17 cells. TCZ has a potent antiangiogenic effect and impedes TNBC cells to promote the differentiation of endothelial cells into network-like tubular structures in vitro, and impaired neovascularization in humanized breast orthotopic tumor xenografts. Therefore, TCZ could be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC. In this study, we demonstrated and suggest that the AnxA1 and IL-6 pathways seem to act together in TNBC cells, leading to higher aggressiveness. The mechanism currently evaluated must be considered together with others that may interfere with the behavior of breast tumor cells; according to our results in Figure 8:(a) IL-6 pathway sustains the AnxA1 autocrine signaling in TNBC. (1) IL-6 binds to its receptor (IL-6R) and stimulates STAT3 phosphorylation. (2) The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway stimulates the autocrine signaling of the AnxA1 N-terminal peptide (N-ter AnxA1) through FPR1. (3) Hence, AnxA1 induces a cytosolic calcium increase and ERK1/2 activation, thus, supporting BC aggressiveness. (4) Moreover, AnxA1 stimulates the motility of the surrounding fibroblasts, thus, contributing to the formation of a tumor-promoting TME.(b) The inhibition of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway decreases AnxA1 autocrine signaling and TNBC aggressiveness when IL-6 signaling is inhibited by TCZ. (1) A decreased STAT3 phosphorylation is observed. (2) The lack of IL-6 signaling downregulates AnxA1 autocrine signaling, thus, leading to decreased ERK1/2 activation levels, decreased cytosolic calcium and aggressiveness and the inhibition of motility of the surrounding fibroblasts.5. ConclusionsIn summary, the present work proposes a functional interaction between AnxA1/FPR1 and IL-6 signaling pathways in TNBC. We demonstrated that in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, the IL-6 signaling cascade modulates the activation of the AnxA1/FPR1 autocrine axis. We decided to use TCZ in our in vivo study as it is an FDA-approved drug, which reduced tumor growth and metastasis formation in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumors. We also described that the IL-6/AnxA1/FPR1 pathways influence TME by reducing fibroblast cell motility. In this sense, new experiments knocking down FPR1 and rIL-6 in TNBC cells can further confirm the important role of these receptors in cell survival and aggressiveness. Finally, IL-6 inhibition can be used as a possible therapeutic intervention and/or a new adjuvant therapy to improve the clinical outcome of patients with TNBC.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: Immunohistochemistry staining negative control; Figure S2: Whole western blotting image staining; Figure S3: (A) Western blotting cropped images of AnxA1 expression in MDA-MB-231 expressing a shRNA control (shCRT) or a shRNA specific for AnxA1 (shAnxA1).

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

        "title": "Tumor stroma-containing 3D spheroid arrays: A tool to study nanoparticle penetration.",
        "content": "Nanoparticle penetration through tumor tissue after extravasation is considered as a key issue for tumor distribution and therapeutic effects. Most tumors possess abundant stroma, a fibrotic tissue composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), which acts as a barrier for nanoparticle penetration. There is however a lack of suitable in vitro systems to study the tumor stroma penetration of nanoparticles. In the present study, we developed and thoroughly characterized a 3D co-culture spheroidal array to mimic tumor stroma and investigated the penetration of silica and PLGA nanoparticles in these spheroids. First, we examined human breast tumor patient biopsies to characterize the content and organization of stroma and found a high expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA; 40% positive area) and collagen-1 (50% positive area). Next, we prepared homospheroids of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells or 3T3 mouse fibroblasts alone as well as heterospheroids combining 3T3 and 4T1 cells in different ratios (1:1 and 5:1) using a microwell array platform. Confocal live imaging revealed that fibroblasts distributed and reorganized within 48h in heterospheroids. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and gene expression analysis showed a proportional increase of \u03b1-SMA and collagen in heterospheroids with higher fibroblast ratios attaining 35% and 45% positive area at 5:1 (3T3:4T1) ratio, in a good match with the clinical breast tumor stroma. Subsequently, we studied the penetration of high and low negatively charged fluorescent silica nanoparticles (30nm; red and 100 or 70nm; green; zeta potential: -40mV and -20mV) and as well as Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles (200nm, -7mV) in both homo- and heterospheroid models. Fluorescent microscopy on spheroid cryosections after incubation with silica nanoparticles showed that 4T1 homospheroids allowed a high penetration of about 75-80% within 24h, with higher penetration in case of the 30nm nanoparticles. In contrast, spheroids with increasing fibroblast amounts significantly inhibited NP penetration. Silica nanoparticles with a less negative zeta potential exhibited lesser penetration compared to highly negative charged nanoparticles. Subsequently, similar experiments were conducted using Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles and confocal laser scanning microscopy; an increased nanoparticle penetration was found in 4T1 homospheroids until 48h, but significantly lower penetration in heterospheroids. Furthermore, we also developed human homospheroids (MDA-MB-231 or Panc-1 tumor cells) and heterospheroids (MDA-MB-231/BJ-hTert and Panc-1/pancreatic stellate cells) and performed silica nanoparticle (30 and 100nm) penetration studies. As a result, heterospheroids had significantly a lesser penetration of the nanoparticles compared to homospheroids. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that tumor stroma acts as a strong barrier for nanoparticle penetration. The 30-nm nanoparticles with low zeta potential favor deeper penetration. Furthermore, the herein proposed 3D co-culture platform that mimics the tumor stroma, is ideally suited to systematically investigate the factors influencing the penetration characteristics of newly developed nanomedicines to allow the design of nanoparticles with optimal penetration characteristics.",

        "title": "Antiproliferative and antimetastatic characterization of an exo-heterocyclic androstane derivative against human breast cancer cell lines.",
        "content": "Cancer in general, and specifically gynaecological neoplasms, represents a major public health issue worldwide. Based on the effect of sex hormones on breast tumorigenesis and prognosis, as well as on the development of breast cancer metastases, modification of the steroid skeleton is a hotspot of research for novel anticancer agents. Numerous recent studies support that minor modifications of the androstane skeleton yield potent antiproliferative and antimetastatic drug candidates. The aim of the present study was to assess the antitumor and antimetastatic properties, as well as the mechanism of action of a D-ring-modified exo-heterocyclic androstadiene derivative named 17APAD. The test compound was found to be highly selective towards human breast cancer-derived cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-231) compared to non-cancerous fibroblast cells (NIH/3T3), and exerted superior effect compared to the clinically applied reference drug cisplatin. Changes in MCF-7- and MDA-MB-231 cell morphology and membrane integrity induced by the test substance were assessed by fluorescent double staining. Cell cycle disturbances were analyzed by flow cytometry, and concentration-dependent alterations were detected on breast cancer cell lines. Mitochondrial apoptosis induced by the test compound was demonstrated by JC-1 staining. Inhibitory effects on metastasis formation, including the inhibition of migration, invasion and intravasation were investigated in 2D and 3D models. Significant anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were detected after 24\u00a0h exposure in 2D wound healing and Boyden-chamber assays. The anti-intravasative properties of 17APAD were evident after 4\u00a0h of incubation in a co-culture 3D circular chemorepellent-induced defects (CCID) assay, and the level of inhibition at concentrations \u22652\u00a0\u00b5M was comparable to that exerted by the focal adhesion kinase inhibitor defactinib. Single cell mass cytometry revealed that chemosensitive subpopulations of MDA-MB-231 cells engaged to apoptosis were less positive for EGFR, CD274, and CD326, while the percentage of cells positive for GLUT1, MCT4, Pan-Keratin, CD66(a,c,e), Galectin-3 and TMEM45A increased in response to 17APAD treatment. Finally, the novel androstane analogue 17APAD had an outstanding inhibitory effect on tumour growth in the 4T1 orthotopic murine breast cancer model in vivo after 2 weeks of intraperitoneal administration. These findings support that substitution of the androsta-5,16-diene framework with a N-containing heterocyclic moiety at C17 position yields a molecular entity rational to be considered for design and synthesis of novel, effective antitumor agents, and 17APAD is worth further investigation as a promising anticancer drug candidate.",

Interface fibroblasts appear to be the primary myofibroblasts that interact with invasive tumor cells during tissue remodeling.IntroductionA fundamental component of tumor invasion is stromal tissue remodeling, which involves proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and results in anoikis (a form of caspase-dependent apoptosis that is caused by loss of integrin binding of stromal cells). As a component of stroma, myofibroblasts are also exposed to anoikis during tissue remodeling. However, many studies have reported prolonged survival of myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling in patients with fibrotic diseases. Fibrosis is considered an indicator of tissue remodeling and is commonly formed around invasive types of tumors. Considering that myofibroblasts are key regulators of tissue remodeling and a major source of ECM production, which drives tumor progression, the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts may be an essential event during stromal tissue remodeling before tumor invasion.Abnormal and excessive ECM deposition not only is a phenotype of fibrosis but also is associated with cell-survival signaling mediated by integrin receptors during tumor invasion and tissue remodeling. Therefore, altered molecular expression in fibrosis may provide a clue to how myofibroblasts acquire an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling. Previously, we observed aberrant laminin-332 upregulation in the fibrosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) compared with autologous tumor burden and distal normal tissue, whereas such laminin-332 upregulation was not found in the noninvasive counterpart, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Contrary to our finding, laminin-332 expression was previously reported to be downregulated in breast cancer. Laminin-332, a large multidomain molecule involved in cell adhesion and matrix assembly, plays an important role in cell migration and survival by activating many signal mediators through binding to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 or \u03b16\u03b24. The role of laminin-332 in cell survival or anoikis resistance has been studied mostly in epithelial tumor cells, although some data exist on laminin-332-dependent survival of keratinocytes during wound healing. One group demonstrated that the matricellular protein thrombospondin1 (TSP1) induces anoikis resistance in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro . This work provided convincing evidence that an ECM protein can induce anoikis resistance in fibroblasts and suggested that laminin-332 may fulfill a similar function. However, because the fibroblasts used in previous studies were not derived from tumor stroma, the role of anoikis resistance of myofibroblasts in the context of tumor invasion remains undetermined.In this study, we hypothesized that invasive breast cancer cells induce laminin-332 upregulation in myofibroblasts undergoing tissue remodeling, which leads to anoikis resistance through laminin-332 autocrine signaling. To test our hypothesis, we used three types of fibroblasts isolated from IDC tissue and co-cultured them with breast cancer cells to investigate tumor-stroma crosstalk. Our results provide evidence that anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts develop during tissue remodeling of invasive breast cancer as a result of abnormal upregulation of ECM proteins and/or their receptors.Materials and methodsIsolation of primary fibroblastsHuman breast tumors and autologous normal breast tissues were obtained from three IDC patients undergoing surgery at Severance Hospital of the Yonsei University Health System, Korea. The protocol for the study was approved by Severance Hospital Ethics Committee (4-2008-0380). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. Based on the zonal concept proposed in our previous study, primary fibroblasts were isolated from tissue in the tumor zone (TZ, tumor burden), interface zone (IF, fibrosis), and normal zone (distal normal tissue), as described previously.Direct and indirect co-cultureFor direct co-culture, primary fibroblasts were cultured with MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Korean Cell Line Bank, Seoul, Korea), as described previously. MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells were selected as representative invasive and noninvasive types of breast cancer, respectively. Adherent fibroblasts were stained with 5 \u03bcM Cell Tracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 45 minutes. The dye solution was then replaced with fresh prewarmed medium, and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 2 hours. After washing them twice with PBS, unstained cancer cells were plated onto a layer of CMFDA-stained fibroblasts. The co-cultures were incubated in reduced serum media (RSM) composed of DMEM/F12, 1% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin for 1 week. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts and unstained breast cancer cells were sorted with flow cytometry and used for subsequent experiments. For indirect co-culture, conditioned medium (CM) was prepared by culturing MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells at 80% confluency in RSM for 1 day. The CM was filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and diluted 1:1 with fresh RSM before addition to fibroblast cultures, which were incubated for a further 3 days.Transfection of fibroblasts with integrin \u03b24For transient transfection with integrin \u03b24, fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated on a six-well plate and transfected with 3 \u03bcg pRK6 b4 plasmid DNA (Addgene plasmid 16037; Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA; kindly donated by Dr. FG Giancotti, Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA), and 3 \u03bcl MATRA (Promokine, Heidelberg, Germany) in a total volume of 200 \u03bcl Opti-MEM on a Universal Magnet Plate (Promokine) for 15 minutes. Controls were transfected with 3 \u03bcg pRK5.Anoikis assaysFibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 1 ml) were added to either poly-HEMA- or serum-coated wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 with RSM, MCF-7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 6, 24, 48, or 72 hour. Maintenance of suspended fibroblasts in poly-HEMA-coated wells (anoikis conditions) was monitored by phase microscopy. Cell viability was measured by addition of 100 \u00b5l CCK-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) to each well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours, fluorescence was measured with a plate reader (excitation, 530 nm/emission, 580 nm). Fibroblasts from three IDC patients were assayed in triplicate in at least three separate experiments. For function-blocking assays, antibodies against integrin \u03b21, \u03b24, or laminin-332 (Millipore) were added to InF cells (which have high expression of laminin-332) with MDA-MB-231 CM and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hours. CAF cells (which express low levels of laminin-332) were treated with purified laminin-332 (Abcam, Cambridge, England) in RSM for 24 hours.Caspase-3 activity assayCaspase-3 activity in fibroblast lysates was measured by using a caspase-3 activity kit (Becton-Dickinson-Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA). Fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105 cells) were plated in poly-HEMA-coated-wells with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM and treated with blocking antibodies or purified laminin-332 for 24 hours. Fibroblast lysates were incubated in a 96-well plate in HEPES buffer with 5 \u00b5l caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in the dark. Fluorescence was measured with a plate reader (excitation, 360 nm/emission, 460 nm).Rac1 pull-down assaySuspended fibroblasts were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in 1\u00d7 lysis buffer. Rac/cdc42 assay reagent (10 \u00b5l; 10 \u00b5g) was added to 0.5 ml cell lysate, and the reaction mixture was incubated by rocking gently at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. Agarose beads were collected by pulsing for 5 seconds in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pelleted beads were washed 3 times with 0.5 ml Mg2+ Lysis/Wash Buffer (MLB), resuspended in 40 \u00b5l 5\u00d7 Laemmli reducing sample buffer, boiled for 5 minutes, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then detected with immunoblot.ImmunoblottingSuspended cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed in 100 \u03bcl Protein Extraction Solution (Intron Biotech, Seongnan-si, Korea), homogenized with a 30-gauge needle, incubated for 30minutes at 4\u00b0C, and then purified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. After quantifying proteins in the extracts by using the Bradford method, 20 \u03bcg protein was electrophoresed on 10% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore), and probed with primary antibodies against laminin \u03b32, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b16, integrin \u03b21, integrin \u03b24, Akt, phospho(Ser473)-Akt, E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), or Rac1 (Millipore). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen), and visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).StatisticsStatistical significance (indicated by asterisks) was determined by using the t test and ANOVA. Results were considered to be significant at P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS version 11.5 for Windows statistical software (SPSS Inc.).ResultsInvasive breast cancer cells induce upregulation of laminin-332 expression in stromal fibroblastsBased on the zonal concept that we previously introduced, stromal fibroblasts were isolated from each zone of IDC tissue after confirming expression of laminin-\u03b32, a subunit used to identify laminin-332. Primary fibroblasts from the tumor zone (TZ), interface zone (IZ), and normal zone were designated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), interface fibroblasts (InFs), and normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs), respectively. In morphology, InFs were slightly longer than CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A). After culture, InFs expressed a higher level of laminin-\u03b32 than did CAFs and NBFs, as they do in situ, and InFs and CAFs expressed a higher level of \u03b1-SMA did than NBFs (Figure 1B). To test whether factors secreted by invasive breast cancer cells can further increase fibroblast laminin-\u03b32 expression, we treated cultured fibroblasts with MDA-MB-231 CM. MDA-MB-231 CM dramatically increased laminin-\u03b32 expression in InFs compared with CAFs and NBFs. Thus, although MDA-MB-231 CM enhanced laminin-\u03b32 expression in all fibroblasts, the degree of increase depended on the intrinsic capacity of the cells to express laminin-\u03b32. In contrast, MCF7 CM suppressed laminin-\u03b32 expression (Figure 1C). Because the IZ is densely fibrotic, a hallmark of the tissue remodeling that leads to anoikis of stromal cells, the capacity of InFs to express laminin-332 under anoikis conditions was evaluated in the absence or presence of MDA-MB-231 CM stimulation. In InFs stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM, overexpression of laminin-\u03b32 was evident at 24 hours and was maintained for 72 hours (Figure 1D). Because transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 is a major component of MDA-MB-231 CM, we speculated that it might be responsible for inducing laminin-332 overexpression. To test this, we treated InFs with 100 nM LY2157299, a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, and MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours and found that laminin-\u03b32 expression was suppressed in the LY2157299-treated InFs (see Additional file 1, Figure S1).Laminin-332 expression in stromal fibroblasts is upregulated by invasive breast cancer cells. (A) Isolation of stromal fibroblasts from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Based on the zonal concept introduced in our previous study, fibroblasts were isolated from early-stage IDC tissue (less than 10 mm diameter) by enzyme digestion after confirmation of laminin-\u03b32 expression. (B) Expression of laminin-\u03b32 and \u03b1-SMA in fibroblasts of IDC. (C) Stimulation of laminin-\u03b32 expression in fibroblasts by CM from cancer cells. Fibroblasts were incubated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours. (D) Duration of laminin-\u03b32 expression in interface fibroblasts (InFs) under anoikis conditions. InFs (5 \u00d7 105 cell/well) were seeded onto poly-HEMA coated six-well plates with RSM or MDA-MB-231 CM for 72 hours. Suspended cells were collected at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours, as indicated.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in fibroblasts is induced through direct contact with invasive breast cancer cellsTwo integrin receptors for laminin-332, integrins \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24, are associated with signaling pathways for cell survival. A high level of integrins \u03b13 and \u03b16 expression was found in the fibroblasts derived from IDC (see Additional file 1 Figure S2). Integrin \u03b21 was also highly expressed in the fibroblasts, whereas integrin \u03b24 was not expressed (Figure 2A). It is widely known that the repertoire or pattern of integrin expression in stromal cells can be changed through communication with tumor cells. Because the IZ is adjacent to the TZ within tissue, CAFs and InFs can directly or indirectly communicate with tumor cells, and, as a result, the pattern of integrin expression in myofibroblasts may be altered. To test the effect of indirect communication with tumor cells, the fibroblasts were stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM or MCF7 CM. Integrin \u03b21 expression was not significantly affected, but remained high, independent of CM stimulation (see Additional file 1, Figure S3A). Integrin \u03b24 expression was also unchanged and remained undetectable (see Additional file 1, Figure S3B). For direct communication with tumor cells, fibroblasts were co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells. Integrin \u03b21 expression was not affected by direct contact with cancer cells, but was highly sustained (Figure 2B). In contrast, de novo expression of integrin \u03b24 was induced by direct contact with MDA-MB-231, but not MCF7, cells (Figure 2C). Neoexpression of integrin \u03b24 protein was also detected in fibroblasts after sorting from the co-culture.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression is induced in fibroblasts through direct contact with invasive breast cancer cells. (A) Endogenous expression of integrin \u03b21 and \u03b24 in fibroblasts of IDC. Fibroblasts were prestained with CMFDA and cultured in RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM for 72 hours before staining with PE-conjugated anti-integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 antibodies. (B) Integrin \u03b21 expression and (C) Integrin \u03b24 expression in fibroblasts cocultured with MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells. Confluent fibroblasts on 100-mm dishes were stained with 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 105) were added to the stained fibroblasts and cocultured for 1 week. Mixed cells were collected and stained with PE-conjugated anti-integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 antibodies. Integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 expression in cocultured fibroblasts was confirmed by immunoblot analysis after sorting.Anoikis resistance of fibroblasts is conferred by binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and by neoexpression of integrin \u03b24We found that MDA-MB-231 cells induced laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in fibroblasts, and that the fibroblasts expressed a high level of integrin \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b21 independent of their interaction with cancer cells (Figure 2, and see Additional file 1, Figure S2). Therefore, we hypothesized that the fibroblasts in IDC overcome anoikis through laminin-332-dependent survival pathways that are mediated by integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and/or \u03b16\u03b24. For the anoikis assay, laminin-332 upregulation in fibroblasts was induced by treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM, and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression was induced by transfection with an integrin \u03b24 plasmid. Integrin \u03b24 overexpression was confirmed in all transfected fibroblasts (see Additional file 1, Figure S4). Anoikis resistance of fibroblasts was examined by measuring their viability under anoikis conditions. In the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the viability of InFs (which express high levels of laminin-332) was increased by MDA-MB-231 CM but decreased by MCF7 CM, compared with the control incubated with reduced serum media (RSM) only. In the presence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the viability of InFs was dramatically increased at 6 hours and maintained at a level approximately twofold higher than that without integrin \u03b24 through 72 hours. In addition, the viability of these cells was further enhanced by treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 3A). Similar to that of InFs, the viability of CAFs (which express low levels of laminin-332) was increased by MDA-MB-231 CM and integrin \u03b24 induction, although the viability of CAFs was lower than that of InFs (Figure 3B). The viability of NBFs (expressing medium levels of laminin-322) showed a pattern similar to those of InFs and CAFs (Figure 3C). The viability of the three types of fibroblasts at 72 hours is directly compared in Figure 3D. Induction of integrin \u03b24 enhanced the viability of all fibroblast types approximately twofold compared with fibroblasts lacking integrin \u03b24. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 CM only increased the viability of InFs, and to a lesser extent than did integrin \u03b24 induction.The anoikis resistance of fibroblasts is mediated by binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and/or integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Viability of wild-type and integrin \u03b24-expressing (A) InFs, (B) CAFs, and (C) NBFs in the absence or presence of stimulation from cancer cells under anoikis conditions. The figures show fibroblast viability in RSM (open square), MCF7 CM (open diamond), and MDA-MB-231 CM (open circle) in the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, and viability in RSM (black square), MCF7 CM (black diamond), and MDA-MB-231 CM (black circle) in the presence of integrin \u03b24 expression.

Black bar, CAFs; gray bar, InFs; white bar, NBFs; gray box, integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts. (E) Inhibition of the interaction between laminin-332 and integrin. InF and InF/\u03b24 cells were treated with isotype (black bar) and blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 (dark gray bar), \u03b24 (light gray bar), and laminin-332 (white bar) for 24 hours under anoikis conditions. (F) Increased viability of CAFs in response to treatment with laminin-332. CAF and CAF/\u03b24 cells were treated with purified laminin-332 (diluted to 10 \u03bcM with RSM) in poly-HEMA-treated 96-well plates for 24 hours. Black bar, untreated CAFs; white bar, laminin-322-treated CAFs. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.03 versus RSM in poly-HEMA-coated wells. Results are averages of three separate experiments.To confirm that fibroblast viability was associated with binding of laminin-332 to integrins \u03b13\u03b21 and/or \u03b16\u03b24, InFs and InFs/\u03b24 (expressing integrin \u03b24) were first stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM to induce laminin-332 upregulation and then treated with blocking antibodies against laminin-332, integrin \u03b21, or integrin \u03b24. The viability of both InF and InFs/\u03b24 was inhibited by blocking integrin \u03b21 and laminin-332, whereas blocking integrin \u03b24 had little effect (Figure 3E).To show that the viability of fibroblasts depends on laminin-332 expression, CAFs (Ln-332-low) were treated with 10 \u03bcM purified laminin-332, resulting in increased viability. The viability of CAFs/\u03b24 was strongly maintained, independent of laminin-332 treatment (Figure 3F).Laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppress caspase-3 activity in fibroblastsAnoikis is a form of caspase-dependent apoptosis that is caused by loss of integrin binding. Because caspase-3 is a key effector in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, we examined caspase-3 activity in fibroblasts in the absence or presence of cancer cell CM for 72 hours. Without integrin \u03b24 expression, InFs had lower caspase-3 activity than did CAFs and NBFs, and MDA-MB-231 CM further reduced caspase-3 activity, whereas MCF7 CM had no effect. In addition, the induction of integrin \u03b24 dramatically reduced caspase-3 activity, which also became much less dependent on MDA-MB-231 CM stimulation. The lowest measured caspase-3 activity was in InFs/\u03b24 cells stimulated with MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 4A). To confirm whether the caspase-3 activity of fibroblasts is regulated by the binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 or \u03b16\u03b24, InFs and InFs/\u03b24 cells were treated with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21, \u03b24, or laminin-332, and their caspase-3 activity was compared. Inhibition of integrin \u03b21 significantly inhibited caspase-3 activity in InFs and InFs/\u03b24, whereas inhibition of integrin \u03b24 and laminin-332 had no effect.Laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppressed caspase-3 activity in fibroblasts.

(B) Caspase-3 activity according to inhibition of integrin \u03b21 (dark-gray bar), \u03b24 (light-gray bar), or laminin-332 (white bar). The black bar shows the isotype control.

Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.03 versus RSM in poly-HEMA-coated wells. Results are averages of three separate experiments.Similar to these results, induction of integrin \u03b24 also reduced caspase-3 activity (Figure 4B). To show further that the caspase-3 activity of fibroblasts was decreased by laminin-332 upregulation, CAFs (Ln-332-low) and CAFs/\u03b24 were treated with 10 \u03bcM purified laminin-332, and the resulting caspase-3 activities were measured. Treatment with laminin-332 significantly decreased caspase-3 activity in both CAFs and CAFs/\u03b24 (Figure 4C).Enhancement of anoikis resistance by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression is mediated by Rac1 activationAkt phosphorylation and Rac1 activation are associated with integrin-mediated anoikis resistance. In the absence of stimulation from cancer cells, InFs showed a higher level of phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) than did CAFs and NBFs. Akt phosphorylation was enhanced by MDA-MB-231 CM and decreased by MCF7 CM (Figure 5A). GTP-bound Rac1 was downregulated in InFs but upregulated in CAFs and NBFs, and MCF7 CM further increased GTP-bound Rac1 in InFs (Figure 5A). Induction of integrin \u03b24 expression dramatically increased GTP-bound Rac1, independent of stimulation from cancer cells, but did not have a significant effect on Akt phosphorylation (Figure 5B).Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression induces Rac1 activation. Akt phosphorylation and Rac1 activation is shown in (A) wild-type and (B) integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts. Wild-type and integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts were incubated in RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM under anoikis conditions for 24 hours. Suspended fibroblasts were harvested for Rac1 pull-down assays.Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses aggregation of fibroblasts under anoikis conditionsSynoikis, the formation of cell aggregates in nonadherent conditions, has been proposed as a mechanism by which cells overcome anoikis. Therefore, we investigated the role of synoikis in the anoikis resistance of fibroblasts and whether it is affected by laminin-332 upregulation or integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. In the absence of integrin \u03b24 expression, the fibroblasts aggregated and formed big clusters under anoikis conditions; this aggregation was not affected by the upregulation of laminin-332 by MDA-MB-231 CM (Figure 6A). In contrast, integrin \u03b24 expression suppressed fibroblast aggregation independent of laminin-332 (Figure 6B). To confirm whether fibroblast aggregation is caused by integrin \u03b24 expression, rather than binding of laminin-332 to integrins, we treated fibroblasts with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24. Neither blocking antibody affected fibroblast aggregation (Figure 6C). Based on these findings, we suggest that integrin \u03b24 suppresses fibroblast aggregation in anoikis conditions. Synoikis is known to depend on E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion; therefore, the suppressive effect of integrin \u03b24 expression on fibroblast aggregation may be caused by a decrease in E-cadherin expression. However, the fibroblasts expressing integrin \u03b24 did not show decreased E-cadherin expression compared with wild-type controls. Because \u03b2-catenin displays E-cadherin on the cell surface, we postulated that downregulation of \u03b2-catenin may be the cause of defective E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell interaction. Consistent with this notion, \u03b2-catenin expression was decreased in fibroblasts expressing integrin \u03b24 (Figure 6D).Integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions. Formation of fibroblast aggregates under anoikis conditions in (A) the absence or (B) the presence of integrin \u03b24. Fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 105) were plated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM on poly-HEMA-coated six-well plates and incubated for 24 hours. The formation of cell aggregates was observed with phase microscopy. (C) The scattering of integrin \u03b24-expressing fibroblasts under anoikis conditions was not affected by blocking the laminin-332/integrin interaction. Fibroblasts (2.5 \u00d7 104) were plated with RSM, MCF7 CM, or MDA-MB-231 CM on poly-HEMA-coated 96-well plates with blocking antibodies against integrin \u03b21 or \u03b24 (diluted 1:100 with RSM) or MDA-MB-231 CM for 24 hours. (D) Decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin may cause reduced fibroblast aggregation. Suspended cells were collected, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis of \u03b2-catenin expression.DiscussionIn the present work, we hypothesized that myofibroblasts gain an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling through laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression induced by interaction with invasive breast cancer cells. To prove our hypothesis, we isolated three types of fibroblasts, CAFs from the tumor zone (the epicenter of tumor burden), InFs from the interface zone (fibrosis), and NBFs from the normal zone (distal normal tissue) of IDC, and co-cultured them with tumor cells to investigate the tumor-stroma interaction. InFs, the myofibroblasts undergoing tissue remodeling, showed a higher resistance to anoikis than did CAFs and NBFs as a result of their high endogenous expression level of laminin-332 and its dramatic upregulation by conditioned medium from invasive MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. In addition, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression was induced in fibroblasts by cell-to-cell contact with MDA-MB-231 cells regardless of the type of fibroblast, and expression of integrin \u03b24 increased anoikis resistance to a level approximately twofold higher than that induced by laminin-332 upregulation. From these results, we conclude that invasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling by inducing laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression, and that InFs may be the primary myofibroblasts involved in tissue remodeling during invasion of breast cancer cells.This may be the first study to describe how myofibroblasts acquire an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodeling by using a model of invasive breast cancer. Previously, one group reported that transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) confers an anoikis-resistant phenotype on normal primary human fetal lung fibroblasts, and another group showed that the matricellular protein TSP1 induces anoikis resistance in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, the fibroblasts used in these studies were not derived from tumor stroma, and we believed that it was necessary to investigate the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts in the context of tumor progression. Therefore, in this study, we used IDC to examine the development of anoikis-resistant myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling.We chose to study IDC for two reasons: the first was the dense fibrosis around the tumor burden, which is a phenotype of vigorous tissue remodeling, and the second was aberrant upregulation of laminin-332 in the fibrosis (in contrast, laminin-332 upregulation was not detected in its counterpart, DCIS). Because laminin-332 is widely known to promote cell survival, the anoikis resistance of myofibroblasts is likely mediated by laminin-332-dependent signaling. To test this assumption, we first investigated laminin-322 expression in CAFs, InFs, and NBFs and found that the expression pattern in the fibroblasts was the same as that in situ (Figure 1A). Based on \u03b1-SMA expression and their location in the tissue, CAFs and InFs are presumed to be the myofibroblasts that interact with invasive tumor cells during tissue remodeling.Within the interface zone (IZ) adjacent to the tumor zone (TZ), invasive breast cancer cells may interact with InFs via cell-to-cell contact at the border between the TZ and IZ or with diffusible factors away from the border and within the IZ. It is therefore possible that the expression of laminin-332 or its receptors, integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24, is affected differently according to the type of interaction. To test this notion, fibroblasts were co-cultured with tumor cells to simulate cell-to-cell contact or were stimulated with the CM from tumor cells to test the role of diffusible factors. In our previous study, laminin-332 upregulation in the IZ was shown to be associated with tumor invasiveness. Thus, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 were used as invasive and noninvasive breast cancer cell types, respectively. After treatment with MDA-MB-231 CM, but not MCF7 CM, laminin-\u03b32, a subunit used to identify laminin-332, was upregulated in InFs, and this upregulation was maintained under anoikis conditions. Expression of laminin-\u03b32 in CAFs and NBFs was also promoted by MDA-MB-231 CM, but to a lesser extent than in InFs (Figure 1C). The degree of laminin-\u03b32 induction by diffusible factors produced by MDA-MB-231 seemed to depend on the endogenous capacity of fibroblasts to express laminin-\u03b32. According to previous reports, TGF-\u03b2 is a major soluble factor produced by MDA-MB-231. Therefore, we examined whether laminin-\u03b32 upregulation by MDA-MB-231 CM is induced by TGF-\u03b2 and found that the TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor LY2157299 effectively suppressed laminin-\u03b32 expression (see Additional file 1, Figure S1). Based on this result, we suggest that expression of laminin-322 is at least partially induced by TGF-\u03b2 secreted by invasive breast cancer cells. However, further evaluation is required because we did not test other cytokines that are highly secreted from invasive breast cancer cells. In contrast to laminin-332 upregulation by MDA-MB-231 CM, integrins \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b21 were highly expressed in fibroblasts and not affected by either diffusible factors or direct contact with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2, and see Additional file 1, Figure S3). Integrin \u03b24 was not endogenously expressed in fibroblasts, but its expression was newly induced by direct contact with MDA-MB-231 cells. Almost no difference was found in the induction of anoikis resistance by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in the different types of fibroblasts.When in direct contact with invasive breast cancer cells, the anoikis resistance of InFs involved both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and integrin \u03b16\u03b24 as a result of integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Although both integrins are known receptors for laminin-332, their signaling pathways, signal duration, and dependency on laminin-332 are different. In the case of integrin \u03b13\u03b21, signaling was dependent on laminin-332 binding and mediated by Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation (Figure 5A). In contrast, integrin \u03b16\u03b24-mediated signaling was independent of laminin-332 and mediated through Rac1 activation (Figure 5B). Anoikis resistance induced by integrin \u03b16\u03b24 was approximately twofold higher than that induced by integrin \u03b13\u03b21 (Figure 3D). This is supported by a report that Rac1 activation through integrin \u03b16\u03b24 produces a long-lasting survival signal. Furthermore, the long cytoplasmic tail of integrin \u03b24 can be phosphorylated by other factors such as c-Met, independent of laminin-332. In addition to anoikis resistance, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppressed fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions, possibly as a result of downregulation of \u03b2-catenin (Figure 6D). Many cells overcome anoikis through synoikis, the formation of cell clusters via E-cadherin-mediated interaction between cells. The expression of E-cadherin on the cell surface is known to be regulated by \u03b2-catenin; therefore, decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin by integrin \u03b24 neoexpression may cause defective surface expression of E-cadherin, which in turn suppresses fibroblast aggregation. Considering a recent report that myofibroblasts in the primary tumor site metastasize to the lung along with tumor cells, in the context of tumor metastasis, single cells or a small aggregate of myofibroblasts may be more likely to undergo distant migration with invasive tumor cells than might a large cluster.In summary, two mechanisms seem to exist by which myofibroblasts acquire anoikis resistance through laminin-integrin signaling during tissue remodeling as a result of either direct or indirect interaction between invasive breast cancer cells and myofibroblasts in the fibrosis (or interface zone) (Figure 7). For indirect interaction, factor(s) secreted from invasive tumor cells stimulate myofibroblasts to overexpress laminin-332. Laminin-332 binds to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 on myofibroblasts and turns on an autocrine cell survival signal mediated by Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. In addition, myofibroblasts that lose their attachment spontaneously use synoikis to overcome anoikis.Two possible mechanisms by which myofibroblasts acquire anoikis resistance via integrin receptors for laminin-332 during tissue remodeling. Direct and indirect interactions may occur between invasive tumor cells and myofibroblasts in the interface zone of invasive ductal carcinoma. Myofibroblasts within the interface zone could be stimulated to express laminin-332 by diffusible factors from invasive breast cancer cells. Binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21 on the myofibroblasts turns on a cell-survival signaling pathway mediated by Akt phosphorylation. In this case, myofibroblasts may simultaneously use synoikis to overcome anoikis. In addition, in the border between the tumor zone and the interface zone, invasive breast cancer cells can directly interact with myofibroblasts, leading to integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Once integrin \u03b24 is induced, myofibroblasts use both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24 as receptors for laminin-332, and become resistant to anoikis via Akt phosphorylation (laminin-332 dependent) and Rac1 activation (laminin-332 independent). Moreover, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression may inhibit myofibroblast aggregation through downregulation of \u03b2-catenin.Second, direct contact between invasive breast cancer cells and myofibroblasts induces integrin \u03b24 neoexpression in the fibroblasts. Consequently, myofibroblasts express both integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and integrin \u03b16\u03b24 as receptors for laminin-332. In this case, cell-survival signals are mediated by Rac1 activation and Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation. Akt (Ser473) phosphorylation requires binding of laminin-332 to integrin \u03b13\u03b21, whereas Rac1 activation by integrin \u03b16\u03b24 is not dependent on laminin-332. Furthermore, integrin \u03b24 neoexpression suppresses fibroblast aggregation under anoikis conditions, possibly through downregulation of \u03b2-catenin.ConclusionsInvasive breast cancer cells confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype on myofibroblasts during tissue remodeling by inducing laminin-332 upregulation and integrin \u03b24 neoexpression. Our findings indicate that interface fibroblasts may be the primary myofibroblasts involved in tissue remodeling during breast cancer invasion.AbbreviationsCAF: cancer-associated fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the TZ); CMFDA: (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate); DCIS: ductal carcinoma in situ; ECM: extracellular matrix; IDC: invasive ductal carcinoma; InF: interface fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the IZ); IZ: interface zone (tumor-free fibrotic zone adjacent to tumor burden); Ln-332: laminin-332; NBF: normal breast fibroblast (fibroblasts isolated from the NZ); NZ: normal zone (normal tissue neighboring the IZ); Poly-HEMA: poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); TZ: tumor zone (tumor burden of IDC).Competing interestsWe declare no conflicts of interest in all participants.Authors' contributionsBGK developed the concept and design of the study, performed the experiments, analyzed and organized the data, and wrote the manuscript.

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 3The 4T1-GFP cell line was used to determine whether the 14+ MECs were derived from the expansion of transplanted 4T1 cells. The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

        "content": "Recently, evidence was obtained that the ability to take up alpha-fetoprotein (alpha-FP), which is characteristic of fetal cells, may be required both in vivo and in vitro by different types of human and animal tumor cells via expression of specific alpha-FP receptors. Mammary gland carcinomas belong to this class of tumor. In some neoplasms, expression of alpha-FP receptors is concomitant with activation of the alpha-FP gene and synthesis of the protein, suggesting that an autocrine alpha-FP/alpha-FP-receptor pathway is operational in these tumors. In the present work, 18 human breast cancer biopsy specimens were subjected to in situ hybridization with a human alpha-FP cDNA probe. Positive labeling for alpha-FP mRNA transcripts was seen in 8 of the specimens. Surprisingly, strong positive signals were seen in stromal fibroblasts and lymphocytes infiltrating tumor nests and in adipocytes adjacent to tumor areas, while the malignant cells themselves were hardly labeled. This suggest paracrine stimulation of the alpha-FP gene, probably as a result of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Pathological implications arise from the ability of alpha-FP to regulate growth, either alone or synergistically with other growth factors, as well as its ability to enhance fatty acid entry into proliferating cells.",

However, independent risk factors associated with IR in chronic HCV-infected patients have not been detailly elucidated. Previous data regarding the impact of HCV elimination by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) on glucose homeostasis is insufficient and controversial. This study aimed to analyze the independent factors associated with IR and to evaluate the changes in glucose homeostasis in chronic HCV-infected patients treated with DAAs therapies.MethodsWe screened 704 patients with chronic HCV infection who underwent treatment with interferon-free DAAs. Patients\u2019 baseline characteristics, biochemical and virological data were collected. The outcome measurements were their IR and \u03b2-cell function assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment.ResultsHigh IR (HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5) was observed in 35.1% of the patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2, treatment experience, elevated baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and triglyceride, as well as Fibrosis-4 score >3.25 were independently associated with high IR. In patients who achieved sustained virological response (SVR), no significant change in mean HOMA-IR was observed from baseline to 12-weeks post-treatment (2.74 \u00b1 2.78 to 2.54 \u00b1 2.20, p\u00a0= 0.128). We observed a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell secretion stress from 121.0 \u00b1 110.1 to 107.6 \u00b1 93.0 (p = 0.015). Subgroup analysis revealed that SVR was associated with a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5 (5.31 \u00b1 3.39 to 3.68 \u00b1 2.57, p < 0.001), HCV genotype 1 (3.05 \u00b1 3.11 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.05, p = 0.027), and treatment experience (4.00 \u00b1 3.37 to 3.01 \u00b1 2.49, p = 0.039).ConclusionsThere were several independent factors associated with IR in patients with chronic HCV infection, including obesity, treatment experience, high serum ALT and triglyceride levels, as well as advanced hepatic fibrosis. After viral elimination by DAAs, we observed a significant reduction in mean HOMA-IR in patients with baseline high IR, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience.IntroductionChronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is also associated with multiple extrahepatic complications that influence the clinical outcomes of patients. An important extrahepatic manifestation is abnormal glucose metabolism including insulin resistance (IR), \u03b2-cell dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus (DM). A prospective study showed that patients with chronic HCV infection were more than 11 times as likely as those without HCV infection to develop diabetes. A meta-analysis revealed a 1.8-fold higher risk of type 2 DM in HCV-infected patients than in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive/HCV-negative patients. Additionally, glucose abnormalities can worsen hepatic outcomes in HCV-infected patients. IR promotes the progression of hepatic fibrosis. This may be due to the direct effect of insulin on the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells and secretion of extracellular matrix. Further, high glucose levels and hyperinsulinemia can lead to upregulation of connective growth factor that is involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. In HCV-related chronic liver disease, type 2 diabetes and IR are independently associated with rapid progression of liver fibrosis and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as the elevated rate of hepatic morbidity and mortality.The mechanisms underlying HCV-induced IR and DM are complex and poorly explained. The HCV genome is composed of structural (core, E1, and E2) and nonstructural (NS2-NS5B) genes. The complex effects of HCV core and nonstructural 5A (NS5A) proteins have been observed to play important roles in glucose metabolism. In normal circumstances, when insulin attaches to the hepatocyte receptor, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is phosphorylated and then causes activation of Akt. The activated Akt causes the translocation of glucose transporter-4 to the surface of the hepatocyte and facilitates glucose entry into the hepatocyte. Akt also induces the synthesis of glycogen and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. The HCV core protein impairs insulin signaling via several post-receptor mechanisms, including the activation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family members and consequent decrease in IRS-1. The core protein also increases phosphorylation of IRS-1 at serine rather than tyrosine in hepatocytes, again preventing the downstream activation of Akt. HCV NS5A upregulates protein phosphatase 2A and inactivates Akt, which reduces the expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT2, leading to a reduction in glucose uptake in the hepatocytes, and thus, induces IR. Additionally, HCV protein increases oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8, resulting in systemic effect including hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglycemia, and down-regulation of adiponectin. Epidemiological data suggest that all the major HCV genotypes lead to IR. Some viral-specific factors that influence glucose metabolism have also been discussed. Molecular evidence suggests that HCV core proteins in genotypes 3a and 1b promote IRS-1 degradation via different mechanisms. IR was clinically found to be associated with HCV genotype 1 and a high viral load, although the results were inconsistent.Elimination of HCV by interferon (IFN)-based regimen may perturb glucose homeostasis. Previous observational studies have shown that successful eradication of HCV improves IR in patients receiving IFN-based therapy. The \u03b2-cell hyperfunction is also ameliorated after antiviral treatment. Therefore, elimination or suppression of HCV can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes. However, a few studies revealed no change in fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR) after antiviral treatment. The results of these studies are inconsistent, but they indicate that the benefits of glucose metabolism may also be HCV genotype specific.Treatment has dramatically improved in the era of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). These modern drugs have extremely high treatment efficacy, safety, and less adverse events. These new medications have a higher rate of viral clearance than IFN-based therapy but lack the direct effect of IFN on glucose metabolism. Moreover, the impact of HCV clearance by DAAs on glucose abnormalities remains to be evaluated.Given the presumption that chronic HCV infection involves the development of IR, we hypothesized that HCV eradication by DAAs treatment could improve IR. The aim of the present study was to explore potential factors associated with IR in chronic HCV-infected patients and to assess the impact of HCV elimination on glucose homeostasis in patients who received DAAs therapies.MethodsStudy DesignThis was a single-center, observational study. Chronic HCV-infected patients with DAAs treatment were enrolled. Laboratory data including glucose parameters at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment were measured. Several factors associated with baseline high IR were analyzed. Further, we calculated the dynamic changes in IR and \u03b2-cell secretion function in patients whose viruses were successfully eradicated. This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study design was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Mackay Memorial Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from the study participants.PatientsWe enrolled patients with chronic HCV infection who underwent treatment with IFN-free DAAs therapy between January 2017 and July 2020. The inclusion criteria were patients (1) aged \u2265 20 years; (2) with detectable HCV viral load in the blood prior to treatment; (3) who agreed to receive laboratory testing at baseline, during antiviral treatment, and at 12 weeks after treatment; and (4) who provided informed consent. Patients were excluded if they: (1) missed regular clinical follow-ups after treatment; (2) had a medical history of DM or used glucose-lowering drugs; (3) died from other etiology during the study period; and (4) had concurrent conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus or HBV coinfection, Wilson\u2019s disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Basic patient information, body mass index (BMI), HCV viral loads and genotype, alcohol consumption, and medical history were collected. Patients received different DAAs regimens, including asunaprevir + daclatasvir (2.5%), paritaprevir + ritonavir + ombitasvir + dasabuvir (7.8%), elbasvir + grazoprevir (10.7%), glecaprevir + pibrentasvir (16.6%), and sofosbuvir-based regimens (62.4%). Each patient received one of these DAAs regimens based on the HCV genotype, previous treatment status, presence of cirrhosis, current medications, and comorbidities.Laboratory ExaminationsInfection with chronic HCV was defined as persistent viremia for at least six months before treatment. Serum HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels were quantified using a Roche Amplicor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, in which the lowest level of detection was 15 IU/mL. HCV genotyping was performed using primer-specific PCR and direct PCR deep sequencing with an ABI 3730 sequencer. The sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA levels 12 weeks following treatment cessation. Information on the levels of fasting glucose, insulin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, alpha-fetoprotein, white blood cells (WBC), as well as hemoglobin and platelets at baseline and 12-weeks post-treatment were collected. We used Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index as the non-invasive measurement for hepatic fibrosis. The FIB-4 index was calculated using the following formula: (AST [IU/L] \u00d7 age [years])/(platelet count [109/L] \u00d7 ALT [IU/L]1/2).The glucose homeostasis was assessed by the HOMA method. The formulas for the HOMA model are as follows: HOMA-IR = fasting glucose (mg/dL) \u00d7 fasting insulin level (\u03bcU/mL)/405; HOMA-\u03b2 = fasting insulin level (\u03bcU/mL) \u00d7 360/(fasting glucose [mg/dL]\u201363). We dichotomized patients at a cutoff point of HOMA-IR 2.5 and analyzed factors associated with IR.Statistical AnalysisCategorical data are presented as numbers (percentages) and continuous variables are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The significance of the difference between categorical variables was determined using the Chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test depending on the sample size; continuous variables were compared using Student\u2019s t-test. For continuous variables with wide distribution, we presented data as median (interquartile range) and applied the Mann-Whitney test to evaluate the differences. After univariate analysis, we performed multivariable logistic regression modelling to identify factors that were independently associated with baseline high IR. To compare quantitative glucose parameters between baseline and post-treatment, we performed Paired t-test. All statistical analyses were defined as two-sided hypotheses with a significance level defined at p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).ResultsBaseline CharacteristicsDuring the study period, 704 patients were treated with IFN-free DAAs. We excluded 192 patients with medical history of DM or who used glucose-lowering drugs. Additionally, 65 patients were excluded from the study due to failure of checking insulin levels at either baseline or follow-up (n=34), missing regular follow-up (n=24), and death during treatment (n=7). Finally, we enrolled 447 patients in the study. The baseline characteristics, laboratory results, glucose parameters, DAAs regimens, and treatment responses are shown in  Table\u00a01 .

Univariate analysis ( Table\u00a02 ) showed that several factors were significantly associated with high IR, including indigenous race, high BMI (> 25 kg/m2), alcoholism, baseline elevated levels of ALT, alpha-fetoprotein, and triglyceride, as well as hepatic fibrosis (defined as FIB-4 > 3.25). The association between IR and older age was not significant (p=0.073). For virus-specific parameters, HCV genotype 1 and HCV treatment experience were significantly associated with high IR (both p < 0.01). The baseline HCV viral load did not influence IR in our patients (p=0.953).

To analyze the relationship between viral elimination and changes in glucose parameters, HOMA-IR and HOMA-\u03b2 were considered as continuous variables ( Table\u00a04 ). HOMA-IR did not change significantly from baseline to 12-weeks after treatment (2.74 \u00b1 2.78 to 2.54 \u00b1 2.20, p = 0.128). There was a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell secretion stress (121.0 \u00b1 110.1 to 107.6\u00a0\u00b1 93.0, p = 0.015). In patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, we observed a significant improvement in mean IR (5.31 \u00b1 3.39 to 3.68 \u00b1 2.57, p < 0.001). Additionally, the subgroup analysis revealed that a statistically significant reduction in mean IR after DAAs therapies was observed in patients with HCV genotype 1 (3.05 \u00b1 3.11 to 2.62 \u00b1 2.05, p = 0.027) and treatment experience (4.00 \u00b1 3.37 to 3.01 \u00b1 2.49, p = 0.039) ( Figure\u00a01 ). However, in patients with baseline HOMA-IR < 2.5, there was a significant increase in mean IR after HCV eradication. We also analyzed pre- and post-treatment HOMA-IR in patients with different races, BMI, HCV viral loads, baseline laboratory results, and FIB-4 score.

Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR at baseline and 12-weeks after antiviral treatment were measured. In general, there was no significant change in mean HOMA-IR. In subgroup analysis, IR significantly reduced after antiviral treatment in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience.DiscussionWe presented an observational analysis of glucose homeostasis in patients with chronic HCV infection and the outcomes of HCV elimination by DAAs therapy. We identified several factors contributing to IR in non-diabetic patients with chronic HCV infection. Obesity, elevated ALT and triglyceride levels, treatment experience, and advanced fibrosis were independently associated with IR. Obesity and metabolic syndrome were generally validated as risk factors for IR. In our result, serum levels of triglyceride, a well-known predictor of type 2 diabetes, were also independently related to IR. HCV NS5A and core proteins are known to directly inhibit microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity. The accumulation of hepatic triglycerides reduces insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis and enhances hepatic gluconeogenesis, consequently leading to hepatic and peripheral IR. We did not observe any virus-specific effects of IR. Neither HCV genotype nor viral loads were observed to be independent factors for HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5. At the molecular level, the core protein of genotype 3a promotes degradation of IRS-1 via downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) and upregulation of SOCS-7; and the core protein of genotype 1b interferes with the insulin signaling by activating the mammalian target of rapamycin. Previous studies have investigated the association of HCV genotype 1 with IR, but the results were inconsistent. In the present study, we also observed a higher prevalence of IR in patients with HCV genotype 1. However, the statistical power was attenuated in multivariable logistic regression analysis. This could be because that the genotype-specific mechanisms interfering with the insulin signaling pathway only partially influenced systemic IR. The established risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia, remain the major contributors of IR in HCV-infected patients.The multivariable logistic regression analysis in the present study demonstrated that treatment experience and advanced hepatic fibrosis were independently associated with IR. These findings were less discussed in previous articles. As explained earlier, the HCV core protein and NS5A have complex effects on the insulin signaling pathway, influence hepatic and systemic glucose homeostasis, and thus, induce IR. We hypothesized that prolonged inflammation resulting from chronic HCV infection is associated with dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. A previous history of treatment with IFN-based therapy may imply a longer duration of infection with HCV. Additionally, hepatic fibrosis indirectly supports the probability of a longer inflammation by HCV infection. In HCV-infected liver, inflammation is a key process to drive the fibrogenic response. The immune system secretes proinflammatory cytokines and profibrogenic factors, leading to hepatocellular injury, production of extracellular matrix, proliferation of myofibroblasts, and stimulation of fibrosis. Our finding revealed an association between hepatic fibrosis and IR. It is noteworthy that our result only supported a correlation, not a causal relationship. Advanced liver fibrosis may impair insulin clearance, resulting in elevated serum insulin levels. On the contrary, IR also contributes to the progression of liver fibrosis. The mechanism could be a direct stimulation of liver stellate cells by hyperinsulinemia, resulting in increased production of the connective tissue growth factor and subsequent accumulation of extracellular matrix.We analyzed the outcome of glucose homeostasis in chronic HCV patients receiving DAAs. There was a significant improvement in \u03b2-cell stress. As mentioned earlier, levels of hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 decrease in HCV-infected patients. Clearance of HCV is accompanied by normalization of hepatic expression of IRS and improved \u03b2-cell function, which then influences glucose homeostasis. The IR remained statistically unchanged after DAAs therapy. This result is consistent with the results of previous studies that observed no difference in HOMA-IR between baseline and post-treatment phases in patients with HCV who underwent treatment. However, this contradicts the hypothesis that IR may be improved after HCV eradication, especially as HCV infection is a risk factor for the development of diabetes. There may be several explanations for the lack of an association between SVR and improvement of IR. The development of IR in HCV-infected patients could be a combination of both host- and virus-mediated pathways. The complex hepatic and non-hepatic mechanisms affecting glucose homeostasis may lead to heterogeneous post-SVR outcomes regarding IR. We performed subgroup analysis for further elucidation of the possible causal relationship. We observed a significant improvement in IR in patients with baseline HOMA-IR \u2265 2.5, which indirectly supports that HCV is an important contributor to IR, especially among patients with high-IR status. Additionally, this high-IR status could be reversed after HCV elimination by DAAs. Our subgroup analysis suggested that elimination of HCV genotype 1 was also associated with reduced IR. This relationship was not observed in patients with other genotypes. The result is consistent with previous research, which showed that successful viral clearance was found to be associated with reduced HOMA-IR in patients with HCV genotype 1. The genotype-specific outcome of IR suggested the direct viral effect as an important contributor to glucose abnormalities. In our result, advanced hepatic fibrosis was independently associated with IR. However, we did not observe a significant improvement in IR after HCV eradication in patients with advanced fibrosis. Liver fibrosis is a chronic process. Patients who received DAA therapy could have a rapid decrease in inflammation rather than regression of fibrosis. The duration of our study seemed too short for significant hepatocyte remodeling or IR improvement.As discussed above, patients with chronic HCV infection show an increased risk of IR and progression to type 2 DM. There are no definite virus-specific factors associated with the increasing prevalence of IR. Thus, we suggest that all patients with HCV infection be screened for glucose abnormalities. It will help physicians to identify patients who have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and may require active surveillance, as diabetes can also increase the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the advent of DAAs, we may be able to eradicate HCV with greater certainty and a lower risk of adverse effects. An SVR is generally associated with normalization of liver enzymes, improvement in liver function, as well as regression of liver necroinflammation and fibrosis. Compared with untreated patients, patients whose HCV was eliminated by DAAs have a significantly lower risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, after successful virus elimination by treatment with DAAs, improvement in IR can be an additional benefit and may reduce diabetes-related morbidities. A prospective study found that HCV eradication by DAAs reduces the incidence of type 2 DM. However, a general worsening of the lipid profile after DAAs was observed. The impact of the balance between improved glucose metabolism and negative changes in lipid profile on the outcome of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk must be determined. A significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events has recently been observed following HCV clearance by DAAs. Further research is required to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.This study has some limitations. First, this was an observational, open-label study and had the potential for selection bias. Second, a majority of the patients (98.0%) achieved SVR; therefore, it was impossible to compare glucose outcomes between patients with successful eradication and those with treatment failure. Third, the short-term study failed to demonstrate an improvement in IR; thus, the long-term outcome should be investigated to understand the effect of virus elimination on glucose homeostasis. Finally, we could not clarify the impact of HCV infection duration on IR, and could only demonstrate that treatment experience and advanced hepatic fibrosis were associated with IR.In conclusion, we showed that obesity, treatment experience, baseline elevated levels of ALT and triglyceride, as well as advanced hepatic fibrosis were independently associated with high IR in chronic HCV-infected patients. The prevalence of IR was not influenced by HCV genotypes and viral load. This study provided evidence that HCV-related IR could be partially reversed by HCV eradication, especially in patients with high baseline IR, HCV genotype 1, and treatment experience. Further research for long-term outcomes of glucose homeostasis and diabetes-related morbidities in chronic HCV patients receiving DAAs is required.Data Availability StatementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics StatementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of Mackay Memorial Hospital.

However, the mechanism of homing and recruitment of BM-MSCs into tumors and their potential role in malignant tissue progression is poorly understood and controversial. Here we show that BM-MSCs increase aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines evaluated as capability to migrate, invade and acquire stemness markers. Importantly, we demonstrate that the treatment of BM-MSCs with a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer against platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) causes the inhibition of receptor-dependent signaling pathways thus drastically hampering BM-MSC recruitment towards TNBC cell lines and BM-MSCs trans-differentiation into carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like cells. Moreover, <iin vivo</i molecular imaging analysis demonstrated the aptamer ability to prevent BM-MSCs homing to TNBC xenografts. Collectively, our results indicate the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer as a novel therapeutic tool to interfere with BM-MSCs attraction to TNBC providing the rationale to further explore the aptamer in more complex pre-clinical settings.",

Here we show that BM-MSCs increase aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines evaluated as capability to migrate, invade and acquire stemness markers. Importantly, we demonstrate that the treatment of BM-MSCs with a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer against platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) causes the inhibition of receptor-dependent signaling pathways thus drastically hampering BM-MSC recruitment towards TNBC cell lines and BM-MSCs trans-differentiation into carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like cells. Moreover, in vivo molecular imaging analysis demonstrated the aptamer ability to prevent BM-MSCs homing to TNBC xenografts. Collectively, our results indicate the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer as a novel therapeutic tool to interfere with BM-MSCs attraction to TNBC providing the rationale to further explore the aptamer in more complex pre-clinical settings.IntroductionMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent cells that in response to a large variety of bioactive molecules, growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, are recruited to injured or inflamed tissue to support their repair contributing to stem cells homeostasis and immunomodulation. Similar to site of injury, tumors through production of paracrine and endocrine signals enrolled MSCs in their microenvironment (TME) that is seen as a \"wound that never heals\". The ability of MSCs to migrate to tumors makes them potential cargo for anticancer agents. Once reached the tumors, MSCs may exert opposite roles depending on tumor types, thus supporting cancer progression, as reported in breast, melanoma, prostate and colon carcinomas or suppressing it, as in malignant glioma. The main source of MSCs in adult is bone marrow, even if additional tissues have been identified as font. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) along with fibroblasts, pericytes, adipocytes, macrophages and immune cells play a crucial role into microenvironment of breast cancers, promoting extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration and invasion, neo-angiogenesis, drug resistance and evasion of immunosurveillance. Once in TME, BM-MSCs can trans-differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) or vascular and perivascular cells switching from neutral role toward pro-tumorigenic behavior. Recently, we reported the ability of BM-MSCs to promote migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells through chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). In the last decade, different biomolecules have been found involved in BM-MSCs recruitment and activity into breast cancer including chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5); transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and interleukin 17B; CXCL10 and placental growth factor. Recently, it has been reported that platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) signaling plays an important role in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. In addition, Dhawan et al. showed that platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) along with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are involved in bone marrow support in the dissemination of breast cancer cells.Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), representing ~15% of all breast cancers, are characterized by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and ErbB2, excluding the possibility of specific intervention for these tumors. They are biologically more aggressive and have a very poor outcome compared to other breast tumors.In this study, we investigated the role of PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSC homing and activity into the highly malignant and invasive mesenchymal-like (ML) TNBC subtype. We have recently demonstrated that cells of this subtype have a strong tendency to vasculogenic mimicry (VM) both in vitro and in vivo, and that targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 interaction by an anti-EGFR aptamer, results in inhibition of VM and tumor growth in ML TNBC.To interfere with the PDGFR\u03b2-mediated cross-talk between BM-MSCs and tumor cells, we used a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer, named Gint4.T, that we have previously characterized as high specific inhibitor of the receptor in human glioblastoma. The aptamer binds at high affinity (Kd: 9.6 nmol/l) to the extracellular domain of the PDGFR\u03b2 and impedes the ligand-dependent activation of the receptor both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it has been validated in vivo for its tumor targeting efficacy, resulting neither toxic nor immunogenic.Here we show that Gint4.T aptamer inhibits the migration of BM-MSCs towards TNBC cells and their trans-differentiation into CAFs. In addition, we used in vivo cell-tracking method to monitor instantly, noninvasively and in real time the inhibitory effect of the aptamer on BM-MSC homing to breast cancer xenografts, which ultimately results in interfering with BM-MSC-dependent pro-invasive activity. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic agent that blocks either the recruitment of BM-MSCs into TME and the tumor cell-stroma interactions thus hampering TNBC aggressiveness.Materials and MethodsCell lines and culture conditionAll human breast cancer cell lines came from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. MCF-7 and U87MG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were grown in RPMI 1640.For production of MDA-MB-231 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), lentiviral constructs and infection of cells were conducted as previously described. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated on 12-well plates and infected with lentiviruses in the presence of 10% FBS and 8 \u03bcg/ml Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 48 hours of incubation, infection efficiency was determined by analyzing GFP expression by flow cytometry.To obtain conditioned medium (CM) cells were grown in medium with 1% FBS for 48 hours. The medium was then collected, centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes, and filtered through 0.22-\u03bcm filters (Millipore,Billerica, MA) before being used.The concentration of PDGF-BB in CM of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells was measured using the ELISA method as reported.Human BM-MSC isolation and cultureHuman BM-MSCs were provided by Dr. Lucarelli. Samples were taken from patients after obtaining informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute. Isolation and culture condition of human BM-MSC was performed as previously described. BM-MSCs immunophenotypic characterization was performed by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD146 (staminal positive markers) and CD34 and CD45 (staminal negative markers). The BM-MSCs were used between passages 3-5.BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes has been evaluated as reported.BM-MSCs grown in the presence of MDA-MB-231 CM for 48 hours are referred as \"BM-MSCMDA-MB 231\".RNA isolation and Real time-PCRRNA isolation and Real time-PCR was performed as previously described. Briefly, total RNA from BM-MSCs was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and equal amount of total RNA (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green reaction mixture (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and an ABI Prism 7000 (robocycler was used for amplification Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The gene-specific primers used for the amplifications were as follows:PDGFR\u03b25'-AGGACACGCAGGAGGTCAT-3' (forward)5'-TTCTGCCAAAGCATGATGAC-3' (reverse)\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)5'-ACCCAGCACCATGAAGATCA-3' (forward)5'-AGAGACAGAGAGGAGCAGGA-3' (reverse)Fibroblast-specific Protein 1 (FSP-1)5'-CTCTCCTCAGCGCTTCTTCT-3' (forward)5'-GGGTCAGCAGCTCCTTTAGT-3' (reverse)Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP)5'-TACGTTTCATCACTGGCCCT-3' (forward)5'-CATCTGCTGTTCCGTGGATG-3' (reverse)\u03b2-actin5'-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCT-3' (forward)5'-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCA-3' (reverse)Sox25'-AGAAGGATAAGTACACGCTGC -3' (forward)5'-TCCAGCCGTTCATGTGC -3' (reverse)Nanog5'-GAAATACCTCAGCCTCCAGC -3' (forward)5'-GCGTCACACCATTGCTATTC -3' (reverse)Aptamers and treatments2\u2032F-Py RNA aptamers (Gint4.T and Scrambled), developed by Camorani et al. , were synthesized by TriLink Biotechnologies and purchased from Tebu-bio srl (Magenta, Milan, Italy). Before each treatment, the aptamers were subjected to a short denaturation-renaturation step as reported.Gint4.T aptamer, PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitor: 5'-UGUCGUGGGGCAUCGAGUAAAUGCAAUUCGACA-3'. Aptamer used as a negative control and herein indicated as Scr: 5'-UUCGUACCGGGUAGGUUGGCUUGCACAUAGAACGUGUCA-3'.Cell lysate preparation and western blot analysesWhole-cell lysates and Western blots analyses were performed as previously reported. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3173, indicated as pPDGFR\u03b2), rabbit monoclonal anti-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3169), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AKT (CST-9271, indicated as pAKT), rabbit polyclonal anti-AKT (CST-9272), rabbit polyclonal anti anti-phospho44/42 MAPK (CST-9101, indicated as pERK) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA); rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (A4700, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk1 (sc-93) and goat polyclonal anti-vinculin (sc-7649) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of the targeted antibody was revealed by ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Densitometric analyses were performed on at least two different expositions to assure the linearity of each acquisition using ImageJ software (v1.46r). Blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and cell invasion were performed using a 24-well Boyden chambers (Corning, NY) containing inserts of polycarbonate membranes with 8 \u03bcm pores. For migration assays, all cells tested (0.3 x 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were plated into each upper chamber in the presence of different chemoattractants (lower chamber). After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, the non-migrating cells were removed from the top chamber using a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the membrane insert were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol and counted in 10 random fields/filter at 200x magnification. Results are expressed as the percentage of migrating cells considering the untreated control sample as 100%.To perform invasion assays, the top compartment of Boyden chambers was coated with 50 \u03bcl of diluted (1:3 in PBS) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After coating, chambers were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to allow Matrigel to solidify. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (0.5 \u00d7 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were then added to each top chamber. After incubation for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, invaded cells were visualized and analyzed as described above.Analysis of BM-MSC trans-differentiation into CAFBM-MSCs and TNBC cells were co-cultured in trans-well chambers with microporous-3\u00b5m membrane (Corning, NY). To this aim, BM-MSCs (1 x 106 cells) treated or no with Gint4.T and Scr were seeded into the lower chamber in a 6-multiwell. After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (50 x 105 cells) were added to each top chamber. After 5 days at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, total RNA was extracted from BM-MSCs and analyzed for CAF markers: \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1.NIR fluorescent BM-MSC-labelingVivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent (MW: 1173 gmol-1; A: 676 nm; Em: 696 nm) was commercially obtained from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA), dissolved in 1.3 mL of warm sterile PBS (final volume of 2.0 mL). BM-MSCs (1 x 106) were re-suspended in 200 \u00b5L of sterile PBS and incubated with VivoTrack 680 (ratio 1:1, v/v) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C under agitation in the dark. Afterwards, the suspension was washed three times with PBS containing 1% FBS to remove excess cell labeling agent. At that time, VivoTrack 680-labeled cell viability was assessed microscopically by Tripan-blue exclusion (GibcoTM). To verify that the cells were successfully labelled, they were examined by flow cytometry (BD Accuri\u2122 C6), using appropriate lasers and filters for detection of 680 nm wavelength.Animal Tumor Models and treatmentAll experimental procedures complied with the European Communities Council directives (2010/63/EU) and national regulations (D.L. 116/92) and were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendations. The present study was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization number 38/2015-01-28). MDA-MB-231 cells (10 \u00d7 106) were re-suspended in 0.1 ml of 1:1 mix of physiological saline and Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into the flank of five-week-old Female Balb/c nude mice which weighed around 18-20 g (Charles River, Milan, Italy). Once tumors became palpable (established), approximately 50 mm3 [volume = 0.5 \u00d7 long diameter \u00d7 (short diameter)2], nude mice were randomized into 2 groups (3 mice for each group) for imaging studies.In order to develop a system that models the entire metastatic process, we injected MDA-MB-231/GFP cells (1\u00d7106) in presence or absence of BM-MSCs (1\u00d7106) in 150 \u00b5l of PBS Matrigel mixture (1:1, v:v) orthotopically into the mammary fat pads of severely immunocompromised NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. BM-MSCs were treated with Gint4.T (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours prior injection. Mice (3 mice for each group) were monitored for development of primary xenograft tumor with high-frequency ultrasound system (Vevo 2100 equipment; FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Sixty days post injection, mice were euthanized and tumors and organs were removed. They were either stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin for paraffin embedding/sectioning and H&E staining, or they were embedded in O.C.T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature) compound and 10 \u00b5m frozen sections were incubated with DAPI for 5 minutes to stain nuclei blue and subsequently prepared for fluorescent microscopy of GFP.In vivo tracking of BM-MSC to TNBC xenografts by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT)For FMT studies, tumor-bearing mice were maintained on a diet with a purified, alfalfa-free rodent chow for 15 days before fluorescent imaging to minimize fluorescence in the gut. VivoTrack 680 alone or BM-MSCs (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) labeled with VivoTrack 680 and treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours were administered to MDA-MB-231 xenografts by caudal vein injection. Mice under isoflurane anesthesia were analyzed at different time points by FMT 4000 imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Epifluorescence (2D) and tomography (3D) datasets were both acquired and analyzed by FMT system software (TrueQuantTM v4.0) from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA). 3D regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around tumor regions, and a threshold was applied equal to 30% of the maximum value of fluorescence in the adjoining non-tumor area. The total amount (pmoles) of fluorochrome was automatically calculated relative to internal standards generated with known concentrations of the appropriate dye. After imaging studies, mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and then harvested for FACS analysis of labeled BM-MSCs.Statistical analysisResults were obtained from at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean \u00b1SD. Statistical values were defined using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows by t-test. P value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.ResultsBM-MSCs promote TNBC cells migration and invasionTo investigate whether BM-MSCs have the ability to promote migration and invasion of ML MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells a trans-well assay was performed, in which each cancer cell line was exposed to BM-MSCs, added in the lower chamber (Figure 1A). We found that TNBC cells migrated much avidly when co-cultured with BM-MSCs for 24 hours (Figure 1B). Similarly, when TNBC cells were seeded on top compartment of trans-well coated with Matrigel a strong stimulation of their invasion was observed in the presence of BM-MSCs (Figure 1C). We also found increased expression of stem cell markers, such as Sox2 and Nanog in TNBC cells upon BM-MSCs co-culture for 5 days (Figure 1D).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits PDGFR\u03b2-mediated signaling pathway in BM-MSCsIn agreement with previous reports, we found that BM-MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 protein and mRNA (Figure 2A). Human PDGFR\u03b2-positive glioblastoma U87MG and PDGFR\u03b2-negative breast cancer MCF-7 cells were used as positive and negative control, respectively, in western blotting (left panel) and Real Time-PCR (right panel) analyses.Since several evidences show a critical role for PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSCs homing to tumor sites including malignant glioma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and colon carcinomas we wondered whether the Gint4.T RNA aptamer, that we previously validated as a specific inhibitor of PDGFR\u03b2, is able to interfere with this phenomenon. The aptamer binds to the extracellular domain of human PDGFR\u03b2 thus interfering with PDGF-BB ligand stimulation of the receptor. Firstly, we verified the aptamer ability to inhibit ligand-dependent PDGFR\u03b2 activation and downstream phosphatidyl-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways in BM-MSCs upon PDGF-BB stimulation (Figure 2B).It has been reported that inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 and downstream ERK and AKT signaling inhibited human MSC osteogenesis in vitro . Accordingly, we found that the aptamer hampered BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts but not into adipocytes (Figure S1).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSCs migration towards TNBC cellsNext, we determined whether the aptamer-mediated inhibition of intracellular signaling initiated by PDGFR\u03b2 results in impairment of BM-MSCs migration. As shown in Figure 3A, treating BM-MSCs with the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduced cell migration stimulated by serum, causing 44% inhibition as compared with the Scr aptamer. A similar effect was elicited by imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor acting on different tyrosine protein kinases including PDGFR\u03b2.MSCs have been recently described to home into breast carcinoma in response to numerous endocrine and paracrine signals. Importantly, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer caused a dramatic reduction of their migration toward PDGF-BB ligand as compared with controls treatment (Mock and Scr) (Figure 3B). Next, we analyzed the secretion of PDGF-BB in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 by ELISA. The data showed that PDGF-BB detected in BT-549 was 12,84 \u00b11.52 pg/ml whereas in MDA-MB-231 was 6.46 \u00b11,46 pg/ml. Accordingly, Gint4.T strongly inhibited BM-MSCs migration to both TNBC cell lines (Figure 3C).These results indicate that inhibiting PDGFR\u03b2 with Gint4.T hampers the homing of BM-MSCs to TNBC cell lines.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC trans-differentiation into Cancer Associated FibroblastsBecause CAFs are well known to play a key role in tumor progression and metastatic spread we wondered whether BM-MSCs when co-cultured with TNBC cells acquire the expression of CAF-specific markers. Interestingly, a significant increase of mRNA levels of \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1 was observed when BM-MSCs were exposed up to 5 days to MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, thus indicating that TNBC are able to induce BM-MSCs trans-differentiation into CAF-like cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, Gint4.T treatment strongly reduced CAF markers mRNA expression in BM-MSCs, co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B, left) and BT-549 (Figure 4B, right) compared to Scr negative control, thus suggesting the aptamer ability to prevent BM-MSC differentiation into CAFs in TNBC microenvironment. Further, in order to assess the effect of the aptamer on the pro-invasive function of CAF-like BM-MSCs, BM-MSCs were grown for 48 hours in the presence of CM from MDA-MB-231 (BM-MSCMDA-MB 231) to induce a CAF-like phenotype (Figure 4C). Next, MDA-MB-231 cells invasiveness was assessed by using CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 as chemoattractant in the transwell invasion assay. As shown (Figure 4D), CM from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 strongly increased the invasion rate of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and, importantly, Gint4.T interfered with this event.These results indicate that blocking PDGFR\u03b2 on BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer not only decreased their ability to migrate towards TNBC cells but also their capability to trans-differentiate in CAFs and to induce a pro-invasive phenotype of TNBC cells.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts as assessed by Fluorescence Molecular TomographyTo follow the homing of BM-MSCs toward TNBC in vivo, we labeled the cells with VivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent. As assessed by flow cytometry analysis, a total labeling efficiency was obtained at the experimental condition used (Figure 5A). First, we checked the absence of cell viability loss after labeling (data not shown). Then, nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts, were intravenously injected with VivoTrack 680-labeled BM-MSCs, treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer, and analyzed by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography at different time-points (Figure 5B). 3D images were reconstructed and volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated around the tumor. The fluorescence signal of BM-MSCs was visualized in the tumor at 2 hours post-injection and remained visualized up to 24 hours (Figure 5C). Because VivoTrack 680 emits at NIR wavelength where autofluorescence and tissue absorbance are minimal, a low fluorescence was observed in the tissues around the tumor. As shown, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer strongly reduced BM-MSC recruitment into MDA-MB-231 xenografts compared to the negative control (Figure 5C). Moreover, FACS analysis of NIR labeled BM-MSCs in cell suspension from tumors, revealed a significant decrease of BM-MSCs recruitment in tumors after their treatment with Gint4.T aptamer (Figure 5D), thus confirming the results of in vivo imaging. These findings prove the ability of the aptamer to inhibit tropism of BM-MSCs to TNBC targeting PDGFR\u03b2.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivoIn agreement with previous report we found that the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells is not affected when breast cancer cells were co-injected with BM-MSCs in mammary fat pad of immunocompromised mice (Figure S2). Conversely, BM-MSCs increased the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells in orthotopic model thus correlating with our in vitro findings. To investigate whether the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer has the ability to inhibit BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivo, GFP-labelled MDA-MB-231 were mixed with BM-MSCs, left untreated or prior treated with Gint4.T, and injected in mammary fat pad of mice. After 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the lungs were extracted for analysis. Although no visible macro-metastatic lesions were observed in each experimental mouse group, GFP fluorescence was evident in the lung sections demonstrating microscopic metastasis. As shown (Figure 5E), BM-MSCs induced a significant enhancement in the number of detectable multifocal metastatic lesions that was counteracted by Gint4.T treatment.DiscussionSince the tumor microenvironment contributes to many aspects of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, the different stromal cell types, which play key roles in determining or enhancing several hallmark capabilities in different TMEs, should be taken into account to stimulate future anticancer drug development. In particular, the recent discovery that MSCs can be recruited into TME and promote cancer progression has led to consider MSCs as a suitable target for anti-cancer therapy. Importantly, tumor associated-MSCs contribute to tumor cell growth and metastatic behavior in a variety of cancers, including breast, prostate, osteosarcoma and colon cancers. The high tropism of MSCs for malignant tumors is largely similar to what observed for inflamed and injured tissues and involve the same growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. Tumor cells are able to produce a chemotactic gradient consisting of different chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL12 and CXCL16, which is able to recruit MSCs.Jung et al. (2013) showed that MSCs were both recruited as well as transformed in CAFs by CXCL16 produced by prostate cancer cells. In turn, MSC-like CAFs secreted CXCL12 that binding to CXCR4 on tumor cells induced an EMT, which ultimately promoted metastasis to secondary tumor sites.Many growth factors such as PDGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), TGF-\u03b2 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been found to effectively mediate MSC homing to TME.Interestingly, several studies reported PDGF-BB as a critical mediator of MSC tropism to gliomas. It has been reported that recruitment of MSCs towards pancreatic tumors in response to PDGF, EGF and VEGF, can be inhibited by Glivec, Erbitux and Avastin, respectively. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that bFGF and downstream ERK/Smad3 signaling pathway are involved in BM-MSC tropism to 4T1 breast cancer cells by using a specific neutralizing antibody.An increasing number of evidence has shown that MSCs in primary tumors can differentiate in active components of the tumor microenvironment such as CAFs, which are known to play a key role in tumor progression, neo-angiogenesis, EMT and metastatic spread. Therefore, great interest has been shown in developing therapeutic targeting strategies aimed to inhibit MCS support thus improving therapeutic efficacy in treating cancer. Thus, in this scenario, the starting point for MSC targeted therapy is the identification of specific molecular pathways involved in pro-tumorigenic cross-talk between MSCs and cancer cells. The delineation of key molecular pathways that underlie this important interplay has improved the knowledge of the biology of TME, tumor spreading, and carcinogenesis. Over past years, several studies have shown that MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 suggesting that it could play a crucial role in processes in which MSCs are involved. In fact, it is widely reported that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in specifying MSC commitment to mesenchymal lineages as well as in MSC proliferation and self-renewal. Furthermore, PDGFR\u03b2 signaling has emerged as a predominant pathway in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. Hata et al. , for example, have demonstrated that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in MSC tropism for malignant gliomas, providing direct evidence that tumor is capable of attracting MSCs in an intracranial glioma model through PDGFR\u03b2 pathway. Furthermore, it has been reported that PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC recruitment into TME, contributed to enhance the aggressive and invasive properties of many other tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colon carcinomas. However, although PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitors have already been tested for their capability to target and interfere with receptor activity in MSCs, no studies have still demonstrated the possibility to target PDGFR\u03b2 to prevent pro-tumorigenic effect of MSCs into tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the current class of PDGFR\u03b2 drugs consists of small molecule TKIs that show limited specificity and modest efficacy whereas no antibodies have entered the clinic. This study reports, for the first time, an innovative therapeutic tool, an anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer able to prevent BM-MSC recruitment and activity into TNBC microenvironment. Recent evidences have widely shown that BM-MSCs can integrate into the tumor-associated stroma and promote the progression of TNBC through the activation of different mechanisms involving HIFs, TGF-\u03b2 and CCL5. Up to now, no work has demonstrated the involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 pathway in MSC homing toward TNBC microenvironment, as well as MSC-mediated TNBC progression. Interestingly, in this study we show that the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduces both in vitro BM-MSC migration stimulated by two different TNBC cell lines and in vivo BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts, as assessed by FMT. These results underline the importance of PDGFR\u03b2 in mediating MSC migration towards TNBC site and highlights Gint4.T aptamer to specifically prevent PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC tropism for TME. Finally, recent evidence has demonstrated that MSCs selectively proliferate in TME and trans-differentiate in pro-tumor supporting CAFs. Although the effect of MSCs on growth of breast cancer is controversial and probably depends on the experimental setting of the animal model, conversely, it is well established that MSCs have a significant impact on promoting breast cancer metastasis. Our data demonstrated that Gint4.T aptamer not only hampers PDGFR\u03b2 downstream signaling in BM-MSCs, but it also interferes with their recruitment into TNBC and with their differentiation into CAF thus preventing metastatic lung lesions (Figure 6).ConclusionsTumor microenvironment recruits MSCs from the circulation, adjacent tissues and bone-marrow thus educating these cells to adopt pro-tumorigenic phenotypes. MSCs in tumor cause a formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and can also enhance the proportions of cancer stem cells, promote EMT, and stimulate tumor angiogenesis. These effects contribute to tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Our aptamer-based approach to interrupt the cross-talk between cancer cells, MSCs and the inflammatory tumor microenvironment will likely provide new anti-cancer opportunities.Abbreviations\u03b1-SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorBM-MSCsbone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cellsCAFcarcinoma-associated fibroblastCCL5chemokine C-C motif ligand 5CLLchronic lymphocytic leukemiaCXCL10C-X-C motif chemokine 10CXCR4chemokine receptor type 4DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionERK 1/2extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2FAPfibroblast activation proteinFBSfetal bovine serumFMTFluorescence Molecular TomographyFSP-1Fibroblast-specific Protein 1MLmesenchymal-likeMSCsmesenchymal stem cellsPDGF-BBplatelet-derived growth factor BBPDGFR\u03b2platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2PI3Kphosphatidyl-3-kinaseROIsregions of interestTAMstumor-associated macrophagesTMEtumor microenvironmentTNBCtriple-negative breast cancerTGF-\u03b2transforming growth factor \u03b2VOIsvolumes of interestSupplementary MaterialInteraction of MSC with tumor cellsMesenchymal stem cells within tumour stroma promote breast cancer metastasisBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and the tumor microenvironmentMesenchymal stromal cells promote tumor growth through the enhancement of neovascularization.

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

        "content": "Unlike heterogeneous tumor cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are genetically more stable which serve as a reliable target for tumor immunotherapy. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) which is restrictively expressed in tumor cells and CAF in vivo and plays a prominent role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis can function as a tumor rejection antigen. In the current study, we have constructed artificial FAP(+) stromal cells which mimicked the FAP(+) CAF in vivo. We immunized a breast cancer mouse model with FAP(+) stromal cells to perform immunotherapy against FAP(+) cells in the tumor microenvironment. By forced expression of FAP, we have obtained FAP(+) stromal cells whose phenotype was CD11b(+)/CD34(+)/Sca-1(+)/FSP-1(+)/MHC class I(+). Interestingly, proliferation capacity of the fibroblasts was significantly enhanced by FAP. In the breast cancer-bearing mouse model, vaccination with FAP(+) stromal cells has significantly inhibited the growth of allograft tumor and reduced lung metastasis indeed. Depletion of T cell assays has suggested that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were involved in the tumor cytotoxic immune response. Furthermore, tumor tissue from FAP-immunized mice revealed that targeting FAP(+) CAF has induced apoptosis and decreased collagen type I and CD31 expression in the tumor microenvironment. These results implicated that immunization with FAP(+) stromal cells led to the disruption of the tumor microenvironment. Our study may provide a novel strategy for immunotherapy of a broad range of cancer. ",

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

F Biodistribution of the DID-labeled liposomes in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice at different time points after intravenous injection.

H Semi-quantitative ROI values of mean fluorescence intensity at tumor sites. **p\u2009<\u20090.01; Data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation of three technical replicates; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a01C, D, the glycosyls of Rg3 at the C3-position were oriented towards the water molecules and sticked out of the surface of the liposomal membrane, which could potentially interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively. (n\u2009=\u20093) *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAs cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent CAFs-inducer, TGF-\u03b2 secretion in 4T1 conditioned medium (CM) was measured by ELISA assay after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Scale bar: 2\u00a0mm. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Unpaired t-test was used for analysis of differences between two groups. Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above.

Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was recorded (Ex/Em\u2009=\u2009360\u00a0nm/430\u00a0nm), respectively after leaving the mixture at room temperature for 12\u00a0h. The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score. The optimal docking conformation was determined based on the docking score and hydrogen bonding interactions. PyMol was utilized to generate the ribbon/surface view of docked complexes.Intracellular uptake assay of the liposomes by 4T1 cells2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well.

        "content": "TIMP-1 is one of the many factors that CAFs have been shown to secret. TIMP-1 can act in a tumor-supportive or tumor-suppressive manner. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of CAF-secreted TIMP-1 for the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cell behavior. Breast cancer cells were exposed to conditioned medium collected from TIMP-1-secreting CAFs (CAF-CM), and the specific effects of TIMP-1 on protein expression, migration and growth were examined using TIMP-1-specifc siRNA (siTIMP1), recombinant TIMP-1 protein (rhTIMP-1) and TIMP-1 level-rising phorbol ester. We observed that TIMP-1 increased the expression of its binding partner CD63 and induced STAT3 and ERK1/2 activation by cooperating with CD63 and integrin \u03b21. Since TIMP-1 expression was found to be dependent on STAT3, TIMP-1 activated its own expression, resulting in a TIMP-1/CD63/integrin \u03b21/STAT3 feedback loop. IL-6, a classical STAT3 activator, further fueled this loop. Knock-down of each component of the feedback loop prevented the CAF-induced increase in migratory activity and inhibited cellular growth in adherent cultures in the presence and absence of the anti-estrogen fulvestrant. These data show that TIMP-1/CD63/integrin \u03b21/STAT3 plays a role in the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cell behavior.",

A large part of their actions is based on their high secretory activity, leading to the exposure of cancer cells to all kinds of bioactive factors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Here, we present data showing that CAF-derived TIMP-1 activates STAT3 in breast cancer cells in cooperation with CD63 and integrin \u03b21. In turn, STAT3 increases TIMP-1 secretion by breast cancer cells, leading to a TIMP-1/CD63/integrin \u03b21/STAT3 positive feedback loop, which can be further fueled by IL-6. Functionally, this feedback loop is important for the CAF-induced increase in migratory activity and for CAF-induced resistance to the anti-estrogen fulvestrant.AbstractTIMP-1 is one of the many factors that CAFs have been shown to secret. TIMP-1 can act in a tumor-supportive or tumor-suppressive manner. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of CAF-secreted TIMP-1 for the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cell behavior. Breast cancer cells were exposed to conditioned medium collected from TIMP-1-secreting CAFs (CAF-CM), and the specific effects of TIMP-1 on protein expression, migration and growth were examined using TIMP-1-specifc siRNA (siTIMP1), recombinant TIMP-1 protein (rhTIMP-1) and TIMP-1 level-rising phorbol ester. We observed that TIMP-1 increased the expression of its binding partner CD63 and induced STAT3 and ERK1/2 activation by cooperating with CD63 and integrin \u03b21. Since TIMP-1 expression was found to be dependent on STAT3, TIMP-1 activated its own expression, resulting in a TIMP-1/CD63/integrin \u03b21/STAT3 feedback loop. IL-6, a classical STAT3 activator, further fueled this loop. Knock-down of each component of the feedback loop prevented the CAF-induced increase in migratory activity and inhibited cellular growth in adherent cultures in the presence and absence of the anti-estrogen fulvestrant. These data show that TIMP-1/CD63/integrin \u03b21/STAT3 plays a role in the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cell behavior.1. IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) is the most frequent cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. BC is a heterogenous disease, which is immunohistochemically subtyped in estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2)-positive and triple-negative BCs. ER\u03b1-positive BCs are treated with ER\u03b1-targeting drugs, such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant (FULV), and aromatase inhibitors. Resistance to ER\u03b1-targeting drugs (endocrine resistance) is a common complication in treatment. Endocrine resistance can be induced by numerous mechanisms, including the activations of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathways.The tumor microenvironment (TME) is an important component of tumors, playing a critical role in tumor progression and drug resistance. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are among the different cell types being found in TME. These activated fibroblasts contribute to tumor progression and drug resistance, including endocrine resistance. An important part of the effects of CAFs on BC cells is the exposure of BC cells to a plethora of factors that CAFs secret. One prominent secreted factor is interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is responsible for a number of CAF effects on BCs. This includes the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the upregulation of integrin \u03b21 (ITGB1) expression. ITGB1 is an important surface receptor for the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix. Its inhibition leads to apoptosis of BC cells. It is involved in metastasis, and its expression is associated with poor survival of BC patients. Furthermore, ITGB1 expression was found to be permanently increased when BC cells are exposed to CAF-derived conditioned medium (CAF-CM) in the presence of FULV. In addition, ITGB1 has been reported to induce tamoxifen resistance by activating the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway.It is now well-established that ITGB1 can form a complex with CD63 and with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), whereby TIMP-1 binds directly to CD63. Through this complex, numerous signaling cascades, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathways, can be activated. CD63 belongs to the tetraspanin superfamily of plasma membrane proteins and functions as a network former of supramolecular complexes. TIMP-1 is a soluble, secreted protein, which initially was found to inhibit metalloproteinases. Later, TIMP-1 was appreciated as a multi-functional protein, which, for instance, can act anti-apoptotically on BC cells by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. CAFs secrete TIMP-1 in high amounts. Therefore, CAF-derived TIMP-1 may contribute to the CAF effects on BC cells.Prompted by our observation that one of the major factors secreted by CAFs is TIMP-1, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1 complex in the CAF effects on BC cells. We found that not only does CAF-CM lead to the exposure of BC cells to higher levels of extracellular TIMP-1, but that it also stimulates the BC cell-dependent secretion of this protein. Furthermore, we found that the levels of all three components of the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1 complex are increased in response to CAF-CM and that, through this complex, CAF-CM causes STAT3 activation in BC cells. Functionally, this complex was important for cellular growth and CAF-CM-induced migration.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines/Sublines and ReagentsAll cell lines/sublines were maintained in RMPI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (PAN Biotech) in the absence of antibiotics. The same batch of FCS was used for cell propagation and all experiments. All cell lines and sublines were authenticated by SNP analysis (Genolytic or Eurofins). The establishment of the MCF-7 subline AnD5 and the preparation of CAF-CM are described elsewhere. CAF-CM, AnD5-CM, BT474-CM and T47D-CM were collected after cells had been cultured for three days. Fulvestrant (LKT Laboratories), U0126 (Cell Signaling) and PMA (Calbiochem) were added to cells at a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M and 200 ng/mL, respectively. Stock solutions of fulvestrant, U0126 and PMA were prepared using DMSO. Mock treatments were performed by adding the corresponding amounts of DMSO. For incubation of cells with the TIMP-1 protein, rhTIMP-1 was added at a final concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL. For treatment with IL-6, a final concentration of either 50, 250 or 500 ng/mL of rhIL-6 was used. Tunicamycin (Merck Chemicals) was added to the cells at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL.2.2. Western Blot AnalysisExtraction of plasma membrane-bound, nuclear and cytosolic proteins and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described. Proteins were either separated on a 10% gel or on a gradient gel (NuPAGE, Life Technology, Darmstadt, Germany). For the analysis of supernatants, 30 \u00b5L was applied unless stated otherwise. The primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit polyclonal antibodies: anti-P(S473)-AKT (1:2000, D9E, Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt, Germany), anti-CD63 (1:2000, Proteintech, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany), anti-STAT3 (1:1000, 79D7, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-P(Tyr705)-STAT3 (1:1000, D3A7, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-TIMP1 (1:2000, C2C3, GeneTex, Eching, Germany); rabbit monoclonal antibodies: anti-integrin \u03b21 (1:2000, EPR1040Y, Abcam, Berlin, Germany); mouse monoclonal antibodies: anti-(pan)AKT (1:2000, 40D4, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-CD44 (1:2000, Lab vision, HCAM Ab-4). The anti-CAIX antibody was kindly provided by S. Pastorekova. Secondary antibody conjugates (anti-rabbit/anti-mouse horse radish peroxidase, 1:2000) were from Cell Signaling Technology. As antibodies against housekeeping proteins are not reliable markers for protein loading, protein loading was examined by either staining proteins with Fast Green (MERCK) or with Coomassie Blue (Blue G, SERVA Electrophoresis). To confirm equal protein loading of supernatants, a Fast Green-stained band corresponding to a large protein of the fetal calf serum is shown. For each condition, Western blot analyses were preformed two to three times. Full images can be found under Supplementary Materials File S1.2.3. RNA InterferenceCells were transfected by si (small interference) RNAs as described. Briefly, following electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulserX-cell (250 V, 800 \u03bcF), cells were seeded on a 10 cm culture dish and incubated for three days. The cells were then either lysed for protein extraction or used for growth or migration assays. The sequence of siTIMP1 is as follows: (sense: 5\u2032-ACU GCA GGA UGG ACU CUU G-3\u2032, antisense: 5\u2032-CAA GAG UCC AUC CUG CAG U-3\u2032). The sequences of siITGB1, siSTAT3 and siCD63 (CD63-2) and the control siRNA siLuc are decribed elsewhere. All siRNAs were purchased from Eurofins.2.4. Growth AssaysGrowth activity was examined by an ATP/luciferase-based assay (Vialight Plus kit, Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) as described. Briefly, for measuring growth activity of adherent cells, 104 siRNA-transfected cells were added to each well of a 24-well plate. For determining growth activity in 3D suspension cultures, the cells were incubated in ultra-low attachment 96-well microplates (Corning, Steinfurt, Germany) at a density of 5 \u00d7 103 cells/well. Under both culturing conditions, cells were grown for four days before they were lysed and ATP-measured by the luciferase-based assay in a Sirius luminometer (Berthold). To study the effect of CAF-CM on growth, CAF-CM was added to the medium at a ratio of 1 to 5.2.5. Migration AssaysMigration activity was examined by wound-healing assays as described previously. Briefly, after introducing a gap in the monolayer formed by siRNA-transfected cells, gap closure in the presence or absence of 20% CAF-CM was monitored for two days. For quantitation, the gap area as visible at 100-fold magnification was measured using Zeiss Axio Vision R 4.5 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For each condition, the average gap area of three separate wounds was determined.2.6. Statistical AnalysesFor parametric tests, one-way ANOVA combined with Bonferroni correction for post-hoc analysis was used. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.3. Results3.1. Exposure of Breast Cancer Cells to High Concentrations of Extracellular TIMP-1 Modulates the Levels of Plasma Membrane Proteins Linked to TIMP-1 FunctionTIMP-1 is secreted by CAFs and cancer cells as well. To compare TIMP-1 secretion by CAFs and BC cells, we chose 19TT, immortilized BC-derived CAFs, which, based on cytokine array data, we have previously shown to secret TIMP-1, and AnD5 cells, an MCF-7 subline with a highly homogenous cell population and high responsiveness to CAF-CM. Western blot analysis of the supernatants (SUP) collected after 3 days of culturing CAFs and AnD5 cells revealed an anti-TIMP-1 reactive protein of an apparent molecular weight (MW) of ~35 kD, which was more abundant in the SUP derived from CAFs than that from AnD5 cells (Figure 1A, panel #1), and which could be eliminated by a TIMP-1-specific siRNA (siTIMP1), but not by a control siRNA (siluc) (Figure 1A, panels #2 and #3). Consistent with previous data showing that secreted TIMP-1 is N-glycosylated, the TIMP-1-specific band disappeared after treating AnD5 cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation (Figure 1A panel #4). These results show that 19TT-CAFs secrete more TIMP-1 than MCF-7-derived AnD5 BC cells. Hence, in the presence of 19TT-CAF-CM, AnD5 cells are exposed to a higher extracellular concentration of TIMP-1.To examine the consequences of higher extracellular TIMP-1 concentrations for AnD5 cells, we first performed experiments with PMA, which has previously been demonstrated to increase TIMP-1 secretion by colon cancer cells. We found that PMA also increases TIMP-1 secretion by AnD5 cells (Figure 1A, panels #2 and 4). Produced at a high level in the presence of PMA, the TIMP-1 protein could now be detected in the plasma membrane protein extract (PM) and in the cytosolic extract (CE) (Figure 1B), whereby its abundance in PM was much higher than in CE (Figure 1C), consistent with the finding that TIMP-1 binds to membrane proteins, such as CD63. Treatment with siTIMP-1 and tunicamycin confirmed that the PMA-induced anti-TIMP-1 reactive protein in the supernatant and in the plasma membrane protein extract was TIMP-1 and that it was N-glycosylated (Figure 1A, panels #3 and #4, Figure 1B,C).We next examined whether the accumulation of the TIMP-1 protein at the plasma membrane in the presence of PMA coincides with higher abundances of membrane-bound CD63 and ITGB1. Indeed, PMA also increased the levels of both of these proteins (Figure 1D,E), whereby siTIMP1 reduced the PMA-induced expression of ITGB1 and also seemed to decrease basal and PMA-induced CD63 expression (Figure 1D). The many anti-CD63-reactive proteins are CD63 isotypes of different degrees of N-glycosylation, as confirmed by treating cells with tunicamycin (Figure 1E).We additionally tested the PMA and siTIMP1 effects on two other membrane proteins, CD44 and carbon anhydrase IX (CAIX). CD44 is another binding partner of TIMP-1, and CAIX is a downstream target of TIMP-1 and CD63. PMA increased CD44 expression, whereas it instead decreased the expression of CAIX (Figure 1D). SiTIMP-1 counteracted the PMA effect on CD44 and CAIX expression.To further analyze the role of TIMP-1 for the expression of these membrane proteins, we used recombinant human (rh)TIMP-1, which in spite of its unglycosylated status (Figure 1F) is functional in terms of its ability to bind to CD63. RhTIMP-1 upregulated CD63 expression and down-regulated CAIX expression, but it failed to modulate CD44 and ITGB1 (Figure 1G). These data confirmed the regulatory effect of TIMP-1 on CD63 and on CAIX expression.Collectively, these data suggest that TIMP-1 positively regulates the expression of its binding partner CD63 and downmodulates that of CAIX in AnD5 cells. Additionally, TIMP-1 seems to play a role in PMA-induced expression of ITGB1 and CD44.3.2. TIMP-1 Is Responsible for the CAF-CM-Induced Upregulation of ITGB1We next examined the potential role of TIMP-1 in the expression of the four membrane proteins in the presence of CAF-CM. As shown before, CAF-CM was able to increase the levels of ITGB1 and CAIX (Figure 2A). The upregulation of the CAIX level in MCF-7 cells was previously found to be induced by the CAF-CM-induced rise in Bcl-3, but the reason for the upregulation of ITGB1 level was unclear. We now show that siTIMP-1 prevents the CAF-CM-induced ITGB1 expression in AnD5 cells, suggesting that TIMP-1 is responsible for this effect (Figure 2B). Additionally, we found that CAF-CM raises the expression of CD63 (Figure 2A). However, this effect could not be reduced by siTIMP1, though the same siRNA lowered basal CD63 expression (Figure 2B). CD44 expression remained unchanged by siTIMP1. These data suggest that, in AnD5 cells, TIMP-1 is involved in the CAF-CM-dependent rise in ITGB1, but not in CAF-CM-induced upregulation of CD63 or CAIX expression.3.3. CAF-CM Activates STAT3 and ERK1/2 by Stimulating the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1 ComplexThe TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1 complex is able to activate a number of down-stream effectors, including ERK1/2 and AKT. Furthermore, we and others have shown that ITGB1 or CD63 can upregulate STAT3 activity. The STAT3 activity is commonly upregulated in BC lines in response to CAF-CM. Additionally, some BC lines also activate ERK1/2 and/or AKT in response to CAF-CM. Since CAF-CM-treated AnD5 cells upregulate all of the three effectors (Figure 3A), we wanted to know which of theseCAF-CM-induced effector activities were dependent on the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1 complex in these cells. We found that rhTIMP-1 mimicked the CAF-CM effects on STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas siTIMP1 downregulated STAT3 and ERK1/2 activities. Neither agent had an effect on AKT activity. An siRNA targeting CD63 (siCD63) and an siRNA directed against ITGB1 (siITGB1) showed similar effects as siTIMP1, suggesting that, in AnD5 cells, TIMP-1 regulates STAT3 and ERK1/2 activities by forming a complex with CD63 and ITGB1.We next examined the importance of STAT3 and ERK1/2 for TIMP-1-regulated CD63 and CAIX expression by using an STAT3-specific siRNA (siSTAT3) to inhibit STAT3 expression and U0126 to inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Expression of CD63 was reduced by either agent (Figure 3B,C), suggesting that TIMP-1 regulates CD63 through both downstream effectors. In contrast, CAIX expression was upregulated by U0126 but not by siSTAT3, indicating that TIMP-1 downregulates CAIX expression by activating ERK1/2. Neither CD44 nor ITGB1, whose basal expression was not affected by TIMP-1, responded to the two agents.3.4. CAF-CM Stimulates AnD5 Cells to Secret More TIMP-1 by Activating STAT3As the TIMP-1 promoter contains a STAT3 recognition element through which TIMP-1 transcription can be activated, TIMP-1 expression in AnD5 cells may be upregulated by CAF-CM through STAT3. Indeed, CAF-CM stimulated the secretion of TIMP-1 by AnD5 cells, as indicated by a rise in the extracellular TIMP-1 level as early as 6 h after the start of the treatment (Figure 4A, upper panel). This can be compared to the 24 h required for a similar increase under control conditions (in the presence of AnD5-CM) (Figure 4A, middle panel). This effect was long-lasting, as even after 72 h, the level of TIMP-1 in the SUP of CAF-CM-treated cells was higher than in the SUP of cells treated with AnD5-CM or with no CM. However, the stimulatory effect of CAF-CM on TIMP-1 secretion was weaker than that of PMA, which already raised the TIMP-1 level after 4 h of incubation and induced a high accumulation of extracellular TIMP-1 after 6 h (Figure 4A, lower panel). These data indicate that CAF-CM treatment leads to higher exposure of AnD5 cells to extracellular TIMP-1, not only because CAFs secrete more TIMP-1 than AnD5 cells, but also because CAF-CM stimulates AnD5 cells to increase their TIMP-1 secretion.To examine whether the CAF-CM-induced rise in TIMP-1 secretion by AnD5 cells depends on STAT3 activation, we treated cells with siSTAT3. We also transfected cells with siCD63 and siITGB1 to explore the possibility that TIMP-1 stimulates its own expression by forming a complex with CD63 and ITGB1. All three siRNAs reduced the extracellular concentration of TIMP-1 irrespective of whether CAF-CM was present or not (Figure 4B), suggesting that, in AnD5 cells, a positive TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/P-STAT3 feedback loop exists that keeps the P-STAT3 level high and through which CAF-CM can further activate STAT3.IL-6 is a typical STAT3 activator, which is a major factor secreted by CAFs. We therefore tested the ability of IL-6 to increase the extracellular level of TIMP-1 by using recombinant human (rh)IL-6. RhIL-6 increased the extracellular TIMP-1 level in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Even after 6 h of treatment, a slight increase in the TIMP-1 level at higher IL-6 concentrations could be seen. At a lower concentration, a rise was observable after 24 h and 72 h. These data suggest that IL-6 is able to enhance extracellular TIMP-1 abundance and may therefore contribute to the maintenance of the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/P-STAT3 feedback loop as fueled by CAF-CM. Hence, CAF-CM can increase TIMP-1-dependent STAT3 activity by exposing BC cells to a higher level of TIMP-1 and to IL-6.3.5. Knockdown of Any Component of the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/STAT3 Pathway Affects Growth and Migration of AnD5 CellsSTAT3 supports tumor progression by interfering with a number of cancer-promoting activities, such as proliferation, migration and anti-estrogen resistance. If the concerted action of TIMP-1, CD63 and ITGB1 are a major way to activate STAT3 in AnD5 cells, downregulation of either component should have similar effects on STAT3-dependent cellular functions. We measured the effects of siTIMP1, siCD63, siITGB1 and siSTAT3 on migration as well as on cellular growth in the presence and absence of FULV and/or CAF-CM. CAF-CM has been shown to increase the migratory activity of AnD5 and MCF-7 cells and to desensitize these cells to FULV.By performing wound healing assays to examine the migratory activity of AnD5 cells, we found that, as reported previously, CAF-CM accelerated gap closure under control conditions (siLuc) (Figure 5A). In the presence of siTIMP1, siCD63, siITGB1 or siSTAT3, the CAF-CM-induced increase in migratory activity was completely prevented, whereby, in the absence of CAF-CM, siCD63, siITGB1 and siSTAT3 promoted gap closure to some extent. Compared to cells transfected with the control siRNA siLuc, the differences in wound healing in the presence of CAF-CM were statistically significant for siTIMP-1- and siCD63-treated cells after one day and for cells transfected with any of the four siRNAs after two days. These data suggest that the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/STAT3 feedback loop is responsible for the CAF-CM-induced rise in the migratory activity of AnD5 cells.Next, the growth effects of the siRNAs in 2D adhesion and 3D suspension culture conditions were examined. As reported previously, CAF-CM desensitized cells to FULV, as indicated by increased growth of FULV-treated cells in the presence of CAF-CM, both in adhesion and suspension cultures (Figure 5B,C). In adhesion cultures, siTIMP1- siCD63-, siITGB1- and siSTAT3-transfected cells showed significantly lower growth activities than cells transfected with control siRNA siLuc under all conditions tested (Figure 5B). There were some differences in the strengths by which the four siRNAs affected growth, which ranged from 25 to 50% growth inhibition within four days of culturing. Overall, siSTAT3 had the strongest effect. The percent growth-inhibitory effects of the four siRNAs were the same in the presence and absence of CAF-CM, meaning that TIMP-1, CD63, ITGB1 and STAT3 were also important for CAF-CM-induced growth in the presence of FULV. These data show that all components of the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/P-STAT3 feedback loop are required for AnD5 cellular growth in 2D adhesion cultures.Further, in suspension cultures, siSTAT3 and siITGB1 inhibited growth by 20\u201350% and 20\u201340%, respectively, though they tended to be more effective in the presence of FULV (Figure 5C). In contrast, siTIMP1 did not affect growth under any condition, whereas siCD63 had some effect in the absence of CAF-CM. The data show that, in suspension cultures, AnD5 cellular growth is still dependent on ITGB1 and STAT3, particularly in the presence of FULV, but it does not require TIMP-1, nor is CD63 needed in the presence of CAF-CM. This suggests a disconnect of ITGB1-dependent P-STAT3 activation from the CD63/TIMP-1 complex in 3D suspension cultures, where cells are primarily engaged in cell\u2013cell rather than in cell\u2013ECM interactions.3.6. CAF-CM Stimulates TIMP-1 Secretion also in Other BC LinesNext, we examined the importance of TIMP-1 in BT474 and T47D BC lines. Both cell lines secrete TIMP-1, as indicated by a faint TIMP-1-specific band after 24 h of culturing in the presence of control CM, BT474-CM or T47D-CM, respectively (Figure 6A). In the presence of CAF-CM, the extracellular TIMP-1 abundance was much increased and further rose with time, suggesting that CAF-CM also stimulates these BC cells to secret more TIMP-1.Given the more pronounced rise in TIMP-1 secretion by BT474 cells in the presence of CAF-CM, we chose this cell line for further analysis. Treatment with rhTIMP-1 failed to increase CD63, P-STAT3 and P-ERK1/2 levels (Figure 6B), suggesting that, in BT474 cells, TIMP-1 is not involved in activating STAT3 and ERK1/2 and, as a consequence, does not regulate CD63 expression. Hence, a CAF-CM-induced increase in the extracellular TIMP-1 level does not necessarily result in activating the CD63/ITGB1 complex to activate STAT3 or ERK1/2. Of note, as indicated by their higher apparent MWs, the CD63 isotypes in BT474 seem to be more highly glycosylated as compared to those of AnD5 cells (compare Figure 6B to Figure 1D,G).4. DiscussionActivation of STAT3 is a common response of BC cells when they are exposed to the cocktail of factors secreted by CAFs. A major component of the CAF-derived secretome is IL-6, which, by stimulating the IL-6 receptor/gp130/JAK1/STAT3 cascade, is a key driver of STAT3 activation. Cell lines that upregulate STAT3 activity in response to CAF-CM do the same upon treatment with rhIL-6. Here, we show an alternative way through which CAFs can activate STAT3 in BC cells. Our data suggest that STAT3 can be activated by a cooperative interaction of TIMP-1, CD63 and ITGB1. The data support a hypothesis by which CAF-secreted TIMP-1 initiates a positive feedback loop, which leads to a higher STAT3 activation level, which then increases TIMP-1 secretion (Figure 7).The STAT3-responsiveness of TIMP-1 allows IL-6 to further fuel this loop. So far, typical downstream effectors of the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1 complex include ERK1/2 and AKT, but not STAT3, though we and others have linked either CD63 or ITGB1 to STAT3 activity. Hence, to our knowledge, our data show for the first time that the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1 complex can be a major regulator of STAT3 activity in BC cells. Obviously, this feedback loop is important for the CAF-CM effect on BC cells, as the CAF-CM-induced rise in migratory activity of AnD5 cells is blunted by knock-down of any component of this loop. If examining the effect of CAF-derived TIMP-1, the amount of TIMP-1 secreted by BC cells have to be considered. We found that, under the same conditions of culturing, CAFs secret much more TIMP-1 than MCF-7-derived AnD5, BT474 and T47D cells. This is in agreement with previously published data showing that LoVo colon cancer cells produce an order of a magnitude less TIMP-1 than CAFs. Strikingly, CAF-CM treatment also increased TIMP-1 secretion by BC cells, an effect most prominent in AnD5 cells. Therefore, upon incubation with CAFs, BC cells are exposed to a much higher extracellular concentration of TIMP-1, whether directly derived from CAFs or indirectly by CAF-induced stimulation of BC cells\u2019 own secretion.To study the consequences of a higher extracellular concentration of TIMP-1 for the BC cells, we first focused on the expression of certain membrane proteins, which have been shown to be linked to TIMP-1. Including experiments with rhTIMP-1 and TIMP-1 secretion promoter PMA, we found CD63 to be a major target of TIMP-1. Consistent with this result, it was reported that in glioma specimens, TIMP-1 expression correlated with that of CD63. Inhibition of STAT3 and ERK1/2 activities resulted in a decline in CD63 expression, suggesting that both downstream effectors are involved in CD63 regulation by TIMP-1. The CD63 promoter contains an AP-1 binding site, which explains the PMA responsiveness of the CD63 gene. In addition, the AP-1 site may be important for ERK1/2 to upregulate CD63 expression, as ERK1/2 has been shown to increase the abundance of the AP-1 component c-Fos.We have previously reported that ITGB1 expression was upregulated by the treatment of MCF-7 and AnD5 cells with CAF-CM. We now show that this effect is caused by a higher concentration of extracellular TIMP-1. We also show that TIMP-1 is involved in PMA-induced upregulation of ITGB1, but not in its basal expression.The TIMP-1 effect on the expression of CAIX, a regulator of cellular pH, was of interest, since TIMP-1 in concert with CD63 was found to upregulate CAIX expression in triple-negative MCF10AneoT and MCF10CA1h BC cells, thereby inducing extracellular acidosis. Here, we show that, contrary to these previous results, TIMP-1 instead downregulated CAIX plasma membrane abundance in ER\u03b1-positive AnD5 cells. It is possible that TIMP-1 differently regulates CAIX expression in ER\u03b1-positive and triple-negative BC cells. CAIX expression in AnD5 cells was highly upregulated by U0126 but not by STAT3 knock-down, suggesting that TIMP-1 downregulates CAIX expression in AnD5 cells by activating ERK1/2. A previous report has shown that the CAIX promoter is responsive to ERK1/2. However, in the same report, U0126 acted in an inhibitory manner on CAIX promoter activity and expression, suggesting that ERK1/2 can also promote CAIX expression. Clearly, the rise in CAIX expression in CAF-CM-treated cells is not linked to TIMP-1. We have previously shown by using MCF-7 cells that CAF-CM upregulates CAIX expression through a CAF-CM-induced increase in the expression of Bcl-3, a I\u03baB-like protein involved in anti-estrogen resistance. CAIX has also been shown to play a role in drug resistance.TIMP-1 has been reported to act in a growth-stimulatory manner on many cancer cells, including BC cells, and CD63 and ITGB1 were linked to drug resistance of BC cells. Here, we show that the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/STAT3 feedback loop is of functional importance for AnD5 cells, as knock-down of any of these factors significantly inhibited cellular growth in 2D adherent cultures and reduced the effect of CAF-CM on FULV resistance. However, in 3D suspension cultures, where these cells form spheroids, TIMP-1 and, in the presence of CAF-CM, also CD63 were dispensable for growth, though ITGB1 and STAT3 were still important. Alternative interaction partners have been reported to be involved in ITGB1-dependent STAT3 activation. Among them are gp130, a downstream effector of IL-6. Interestingly, in the presence of FULV, rhIL-6 promotes growth in 3D, but not 2D cultures of MCF-7 and AnD5 cells. It is therefore tempting to speculate that, by transferring cells from 2D to 3D cultures, ITGB1 switches from CD63 to gp130 as an interaction partner to activate STAT3.Other than the difference in the requirement of TIMP-1 and CD63 for STAT3 activity in 2D and 3D cultures, the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/STAT3 feedback loop may exist only in certain BC cells. We found this loop in the MCF-7-derived cell line AnD5 with a high responsiveness to CAF-CM by showing higher expression of a number of proteins and activated proteins, enhanced growth in the presence of FULV and highly increased migration. In contrast, in BT474 cells, which do not show higher expression of ITGB1 and CD63 in response to CAF-CM and whose growth activity in the presence of FULV is only weakly affected by CAF-CM, no stimulatory effect of TIMP-1 on STAT3 activity could be detected. Interestingly, in BT474 cells, CD63 seems to be more heavily glycosylated than in AnD5 cells. The extent of N-glycosylation has been shown to interfere with CD63 function. Particularly, higher N-glycosylation of CD63 was linked to higher abundance of the MDR1 protein at the plasma membrane. It is possible that the degree of CD63 glycosylation also interferes with CD63\u2032s ability to interact with TIMP-1.As mentioned above, CD63 is not the only plasma membrane protein that is able to interact with TIMP-1. CD44 and CD82 are two additional proteins, which have been reported to physically interact with TIMP-1, whereby the interaction of TIMP-1 with CD44 is bridged through proMMP-9. CD44 expression in AnD5 cells could be upregulated by PMA, which was at least partly depended upon TIMP-1, but, unlike CD63 expression, was not induced by CAF-CM. Nor was CD44 expression affected by STAT3 knock-down, which suggests that CD44 is not involved in the TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/STAT3 feedback loop. Like CD63, CD82 belongs to the tetraspanin superfamily and is able to interact with ITGB1. Whereas CD63 binds to the C-terminal domain of TIMP-1, CD82 binds to its N-terminal region. CD82 has been found to be a metastatic suppressor and shown to suppress migration and/or invasion of cancer cells. Further, BC cells showed reduced migratory activities in the presence of CD82. Zhang and co-workers demonstrated that CD82 mediated the suppressive effect of TIMP-1 on the migratory activity of the pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells. Since TIMP-1 showed a migration-promoting effect on AnD5 cells, a contribution of CD82 on this effect is rather unlikely.In our experiments, the BC-derived CAF isolate we were using secrets both TIMP-1 and IL-6. This may not be a feature of all CAFs in BC, since CAFs are a heterogenous group of cells, whose features also depend on the cancer type to which they are associated. For instance, in pancreatic cancer, two major types of CAFs could be distinguished, myofibroblast-like CAFs (myCAFs) and inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), the latter being characterized by strong expression of IL-6. In human BCs, four different subtypes of CAFs have been identified, which are not distinguished by their abilities to secret IL-6 but rather by the expression of other proteins, including the cytokines SDF1 and CCL11. In murine BCs, six CAF subtypes were reported, of which one subtype showed high expression of TIMP-1. TIMP-1-expressing CAFs are also found in other cancers. For instance, in colon cancer, TIMP-1-expressing CAFs are frequently present in those cancers associated with Crohn\u2019s disease, a chronic inflammatory, IL-6-dependent disease. Hence, the establishment of a TIMP-1/IL-6 loop to increase STAT3 activity may depend on cancer type and CAF subtype.Other cellular components of the TME may also contribute to the extracellular TIMP-1 level in the cancerous lesion. For instance, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been found to express TIMP-1 depending on their phenotype. M1-like, but not M2-like TAMs were shown to secret TIMP-1 and IL-6. Although M1-like TAMs show generally anti-tumoral effects, they may induce chronic inflammation, whereas the TIMP-1/IL-6 loop might foster STAT3 activation in cancer cells.5. ConclusionsSTAT3 is a well-known factor involved in tumor progression. It affects proliferation, migration and survival and is often a target for stromal cells to modulate cancer behavior. A common STAT3 activator that is secreted in substantial amounts by CAF is IL-6. Now, we have shown that, in addition, CAFs may fuel a TIMP-1/CD63/ITGB1/STAT3 feedback loop to increase the STAT3 activity level in BC cells. A higher activity of this feedback loop is caused by CAFs by exposing BC cells to high levels of TIMP-1. Additionally, IL-6 may support this loop by further activating STAT3 through the gp130/JAK pathway. The feedback loop has the potential to mediate the CAF-induced increase in migration and to promote cellular growth. It seems, however, that this loop is not generally used by BC cells to maintain high STAT3 activity. Differences in BC cells to respond to TIMP-1 are just another example of how differently environmental cues are perceived by different cells.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .

Although hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy have significantly improved efficacy in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy resistance is still a substantial challenge in the face of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which hormone therapy is not available. Chemotherapy resistance is becoming increasingly common and involves a variety of mechanisms, including P-glycoprotein-dependent drug efflux, DNA damage and repair, epigenetic changes and apoptosis disorders. In these mechanisms, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are activated fibroblasts, also play an important role in promoting the drug resistance of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs can lead to chemotherapy resistance in tumor cells by secreting exosomes and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and HGF. CAFs can create obstacles to chemotherapeutic drug delivery. CAFs can lead to leakage in tumor blood vessels and decrease the concentration of intravenous drugs. In addition, CAFs can also increase collagen secretion in solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer, enhance the density of tumor tissues, reduce vascular density, and pressure the tumor vascular system.Atractylenolide-I (ATL-1) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz [Family: Compositae] that has been applied in anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antitumor treatments. ATL-1 has antitumor effects on a variety of cancers, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. ATL-1 can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, ATL-1 was found to reduce the dryness of tumor cells and increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. However, the antitumor mechanism of ATL-1, especially the specific mechanism by which it increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, is still unclear and requires further study. ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. So we wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation in tumor microenvironment.Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the CCN family. Initially, CTGF was found to promote tissue fibrosis and harden tissue structures. As a secreted protein, CTGF also plays important roles in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, CTGF can promote the proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells; on the other hand, CTGF can induce chemotherapy resistance. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with lower CTGF expression are more sensitive to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. CTGF can regulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes in tumor cells. CTGF can also induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. CTGF expression is increased in CAFs and negatively correlated with disease-free survival. It has also been reported that CTGF can induce autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by changing the metabolism of CAFs. CAFs have a role in inducing chemotherapy resistance, which explains the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance induction by CTGF from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment.Our previous clinical trials have proven that Huatan Sanjie decoction based on Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz can significantly increase the sensitivity of patients with TNBC to paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, we examined the effect of ATL-I, which is the main component of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, on oncogene expression in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR. We found that ATL-I could significantly reduce the CTGF mRNA level in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. Through functional experiments, we found that ATL- I could significantly reduce the migration of TNBC cells, downregulate the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. Therefore, we speculated that ATL- I could play a chemotherapy-sensitizing role by downregulating CTGF.Materials and MethodsChemicals and AntibodiesAtractylenolide-I (AT-I, purity > 98%) and paclitaxel (purity > 98%) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

The calculation process was as follows:The relative mRNA levels of each gene were calculated by 2\u2013\u0394Ct method, whereThen the log2 ratios (mRNA levels with ATL-1 treatment/mRNA levels without ATL-1 treatment) were as follows:whereIt should be noticed that, each of three biological replicates were performed for the group with ATL-1 treatment and the group without ATL-1 treatment. One of the biological replicate in group without ATL-1 treatment was chose as the standard, then the mRNA level of the other two biological replicates without ATL-1 treatment and the three biological replicates with ATL-1 treatment were all calculated the log2 ratio to this standard. The log2 ratio of the standard to itself was zero.At last, all of the calculated log2 ratios were dealt with Z-score normalization:Gi means the log2 ratio of one of the replicate of gene G. Mean and SD were calculated using the six calculated log2 ratios of gene G (three in group with ATL-1 treatment and three in group without ATL-1 treatment). The normalized log2 ratio was then shown in different colors in the heatmap, which was drawn by Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA). Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. The\u00a0gene-specific primer sequences used in the heatmap are listed in  Supplementary Table S2 .Western BlottingEqual amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

Protein expression levels were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at an appropriate density, resulting in 80% confluence within 16-24 hours. When the cell confluence reached 70-80%, rinsed the cell layer with PBS and cultured the cells in 5 mL fresh serum-free medium. Supernatants were harvested 24 hours later and used for subsequent ELISA. The secreted CTGF protein levels in the medium were measured with a Human CTGF ELISA kit.

Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3-5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and cultured for 16-24 hours. Then, the culture medium was replaced with 480 \u03bcL fresh culture medium and 20\u03bcL polybrene (25\u00d7) per well. Lentivirus was then added to the culture medium at MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 20 (MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells) or 10 (HFF1 and WI-38 cells).Cells were incubated for 16 hours with lentivirus. Then the culture medium containing lentivirus was replaced with 1 mL fresh culture medium per well for the continuous culture. The stably transfected cells were selected by 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for 7 days. The sequences of CTGF-specific shRNAs are listed in  Table S3 .Transwell Migration AssayTranswell migration assays were performed using a 24-well Transwell chamber with a pore size of 8 \u00b5m (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105) were maintained in serum-free culture medium in the upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cancer cells were allowed to migrate for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells that had failed to migrate were removed from the upper chamber with swabs; the remaining cells on the bottom side of the basement membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet. The cells in the lower portion of transwell membrane were counted. A random selection of 3\u20135 fields were photographed and counted under the microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan).Co-Culture ExperimentsCo-culture was carried out as described by Su et\u00a0al.. Co-culture experiments were performed using 6-well or 24-well Transwell chambers with a 0.4-\u00b5m pore size (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Taking 6-well Transwell chambers for example, TNBC cells (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the lower chamber with 2.5 mL culture medium, and fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber with 1.5 mL culture medium. DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was used for HS578T and WI-38 cells co-culture experiments. DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS was used for MDA-MB-231 and HFF1 cells co-culture experiments.CCK8 AssayCell Counting Kit-8 was bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates or 24-well plates at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells/mL with indicated treatment. Six to eight parallel wells were assigned to each group. At different time points, the culture medium was replaced with 100 \u03bcl fresh medium per 96 well or 500 \u03bcl fresh medium per 24 well. Then, CCK-8 solution (10\u2009\u03bcl per 96 well or 50\u2009\u03bcl per 24 well) was added, followed by incubation for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. A multiplate reader (Flexstation\u00ae 3, Molecular Devices, LLC., San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure absorbance at 450\u2009nm.Trypan Blue Exclusion AssayAdherent cells were digested with trypsin into a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was mixed with a 0.4% trypan blue solution at a ratio of 9:1. The live and dead cells were counted within 3 minutes. The proportion of live cells was then calculated. In Vivo AssayMDA-MB-231 cells (6 \u00d7 106) were implanted into the fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/c mice. Tumor volumes were measured every three days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3) = (length \u00d7 height2)/2. When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. once per week. ATL-1 was given at 50 mg/kg i.p. once daily as described by Li Y et\u00a0al.. After 6 weeks of treatment, all the animals were sacrificed. Partial fresh primary tumors were used for primary culture of fibroblasts as described by Calvo et\u00a0al.. Partial primary tumors and mouse organs were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for subsequent analysis.Primary Culture of Cancer-Associated FibroblastsPrimary culture was carried out as described by Calvo et\u00a0al., with some modifications. Tumor samples were cut into small pieces and digested by collagenase/dispase. Then, 44 \u03bcm nylon meshes were used to remove undigested tissue. After centrifuging at 1000 rpm/min for 10\u00a0min, the filtered cells were collected and then re-suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured in the culture dish. Thirty minutes later, the fibroblasts had already adhered to the culture dish, while other cell types remained in suspension. Afterward, the culture media were changed and fibroblasts were cultured for subsequent experiments.Statistical AnalysisData were assessed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Adobe Illustrator CC 2018 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used to represent the data. Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between each two groups. Error bars in the experiments indicate standard deviation (SD). Any values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsATL-1 Inhibited Tumor Cell Migration and Increased the Sensitivity of Tumor Cells to PaclitaxelAs shown in  Figures\u00a01A, B , we found that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 significantly inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays. We chose 50\u03bcM as the ATL-1 concentration for subsequent experiments. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HFF1 and WI38 cells), and then examined the growth effects of ATL-1 on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CCK8 assays. We found 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on TNBC cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a01C ,  S1A ). We then examined the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. We found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel for 48 hrs, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was lower than that of TNBC cells cultured alone (-)( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was higher than that of TNBC cells cultured alone ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). However, we found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel in co-cultured systems, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment was higher than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells with ATL-1 treatment was lower than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). These data suggested that ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on TNBC cells in co-culture systems.ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. Wound healing (A) and Transwell migration (B) assays showed that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 reduced the migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells. (C) CCK8 assays showed that 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells). (D) CCK8 assays showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells) with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (E) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs.

The normalized log2 ratio and p value for significantly downregulated genes were shown in  Table S1 . We found that the CTGF mRNA level was significantly decreased after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs ( Figure\u00a02A ). qRT-PCR and Western blotting verified the downregulation of CTGF at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells following ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a02B, C ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a02D ).ATL-1 downregulates CTGF expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell migration via CTGF. (A) Heatmaps of migration-related gene-expressions from MDA-MB-231 qRT-PCR analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with/without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24\u00a0h.

Western blotting (C) and ELISA (D) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to without ATL-1 treatment by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFWe wondered whether ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration via CTGF. We found that recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) could rescue the downregulation of cancer cell migration by ATL-1 in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays ( Figures\u00a03A, B ). To further determine the role of CTGF, we overexpressed the expression of CTGF with CTGF-OE lentivirus in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a03C ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a03C ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated in CTGF-OE cells ( Figures\u00a03D, E ). We also knocked down the expression of CTGF with shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells ( Figure S2A ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs ( Figures S2B, C ). These data further confirmed that CTGF mediated the inhibitory effect of ATL-1 on tumor cell migration.ATL-1 inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell migration via CTGF. Wound healing (A) and transwell migration (B) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were rescued by rCTGF. (C) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CTGF-OE lentivirus. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. Wound healing (D) and Transwell migration (E) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were attenuated in CTGF-OE cells. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates Fibroblast Expression of CTGF and Inhibits the Ability of Breast Cancer Cells to Transform Fibroblasts Into CAF-Like CellsBecause CTGF is associated with the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, we examined the effect of ATL-1 on CTGF expression in fibroblasts. We found that CTGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased by ATL-1 treatment in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a04A, B ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a04C ). To mimic fibroblast transformation in the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts for 2 days and then examined the mRNA and protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA. Firstly, we examined the effect of recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) on the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs in co-culture systems. We found that the treatment with rCTGF (higher than 5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 days could significantly increase the mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, and we chose 10 \u03bcg/mL for the subsequence experiments ( Supplementary Figures S3A, B ). Then, we examined the effects of ATL-1 on fibroblasts transformation. We found that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 2 days dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, which could be rescued by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a04D, E ;  Supplementary Figure S3C ).ATL-1 downregulates fibroblast expression of CTGF and inhibits the ability of breast cancer cells to transform fibroblasts into CAF-like cells. (A) qPCR illustrated downregulation of CTGF mRNA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (B) and ELISA (C) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. qRT-PCR (D) demonstrated that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the mRNA levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. Western blotting (E) demonstrated that co-culture with cancer cells upregulated the protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. Treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the protein levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. rCTGF rescued the downregulation. (-) in (E) represent without ATL-1 and rCTGF treatment. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Increased the Sensitivity of TNBC Cells to Paclitaxel by Downregulating the Expression of CTGF in FibroblastsTo study the role of CTGF in the sensitization of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts and then examined the effects of ATL-1 and rCTGF on the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that the addition of ATL-1 could obviously increase the inhibition rates of TNBC cells in the co-culture systems, which could be attenuated by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a05A ,  S4A ). We then overexpressed CTGF expression with CTGF-OE lentivirus in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a05B ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a05B ). We examined the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel with CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that when TNBC cells were co-cultured with NC fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were reduced by ATL-1 treatment. While, when TNBC cells were co-cultured with CTGF-OE fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were no longer reduced by ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a05C, D ;  Figures S4B, C ). We also knocked down CTGF expression with shRNAs in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figure S5A ) and found that the ATL-1-driven chemosensitization in co-cultured systems could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs acting on fibroblasts ( Figures S5B, C ). These data suggest that CTGF secreted by fibroblasts mediates the chemosensitizing effect of ATL-1 on TNBC cells.ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. CCK8 (A) assay showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment and rCTGF treatment for 48 hrs. (B) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF expression was overexpressed in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. (C) CCK8 showed the IC50 of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (D) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone(\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. ATL-1 increased the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel in co-culture systems (NC), which was attenuated by the overexpression of CTGF in fibroblasts (CTGF-OE). (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.Atractylenolide-I Sensitizes Triple-Negative Breast Cancer to Paclitaxel in a Mouse ModelFinally, we analyzed the effect of ATL-1 on chemosensitivity in vivo. We found that in model mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells, paclitaxel treatment inhibited tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases. ATL-1 dramatically enhanced these inhibitory effects ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). However, ATL-1 alone had no effect on tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). Western blotting showed that ATL-1 could reduce CTGF protein levels in primary tumors ( Figure\u00a06C ). In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 alone (ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from control tumors (control) ( Figure\u00a06D ). And primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 in combination with paclitaxel (paclitaxel+ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from tumors treated with paclitaxel alone (paclitaxel) ( Figure\u00a06D ).Atractylenolide-I sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer to paclitaxel in a mouse model. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female Balb/c mice (n = 6).

Long F et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. ATL-1 was found to inhibit melanoma and colorectal cancer cell proliferation via the JAK2/STAT3 or AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Ye Y et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells via ERK/GSK3beta signaling. Ma L et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could attenuate gastric cancer stem cell traits via the Notch pathway. However, the effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied.We found that ATL-1 could significantly increase the sensitivity to paclitaxel in triple-negative breast cancer in co-cultured systems. Huang JM et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 sensitized human ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel by blocking activation of the TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in cancer cells. However, we found that when TNBC cells were cultured alone, ATL-1 was not enough to affect the sensitivity to paclitaxel in TNBC cells. This may be due to the difference in cell types. We are the first to find that ATL-1 could affect chemotherapy sensitivity through fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. We found that ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast transformation into CAFs. Guo Y et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could repress the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys by targeting fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD), as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which supports our findings. We found the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 is inseparable from co-cultured with fibroblasts. We speculate that the addition of ATL-1 could downregulate the expression and secretion levels of CTGF, which could inhibit fibroblasts transform to CAF. The change in fibroblasts\u2019 transformation level could alter some proteins or exosomes secreted by fibroblasts, which in turn affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. The verification of this hypothesis needs further experiments. It has been reported that CAFs could induce chemoresistance by secreting IL-6, IL-8, HGF and exosomes, which explains our findings supporting the conclusion that ATL-1 could inhibit chemotherapy resistance via fibroblasts.To explain the biological function of ATL-1 we have discovered, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. Firstly we examined the genes that were involved in our past or on-going experiments. As shown in  Figure\u00a02A , most of these genes are classic genes closely related to cell migration. The down-regulation of these classic genes by ATL-1 can prove our observation to a certain extent that ATL-1 inhibits cell migration. In addition, most of these classic genes are associated not only with tumor cell migration but also with chemoresistance of tumor cells. They promote chemoresistance by different mechanisms. Because we are going to study the mechanism of ATL-1 on chemosensitization, the examination of these genes can provide ideas for us. For example, SOX9 is a key transcription factor and related with chemoresistance; HMGB2 is known to bind to DNA structure resulting from cisplatin-DNA adducts and affect the chemosensitivity of cells; CD44 is related with stemness of cancer cells; S100A4 and CTGF are related with fibroblast in tumor microenvironment. We chose CTGF for further study because it might help us to explain the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 from aspect of microenvironment and CAF. The effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied. As ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. We wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation via CTGF in tumor microenvironment. As CTGF and CAF in tumor microenvironment have successfully explained the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 in the following experiments, we did not further examine other genes by RNA-seq at that moment.We found that the expression of CTGF in TNBC cells and fibroblasts could be reduced by ATL-1, which led to a decrease in cancer cell migration and an increase in chemosensitivity. Several studies have reported that CTGF can promote the migration of tumor cells, which supports our view. Our data also showed that CTGF expression was significantly higher in fibroblasts than in tumor cells ( Figures\u00a02D ,  4C ). This\u00a0also explains, to some extent, why ATL-1 treatment in co-culture systems could significantly increase chemotherapy sensitivity compared with treatment in single-culture systems of tumor cells. As for how the significant reduction of CTGF secretion level in fibroblasts affected the chemosensitivity of TNBC cells, we have the following two hypotheses. On the one hand, ATL-1 can directly affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy by reducing the secretion of CTGF by fibroblasts. CTGF has been reported to increase drug resistance to paclitaxel by upregulating survivin expression in human osteosarcoma cells. CTGF can promote chemoresistance in glioblastoma through TGF-\u03b21-dependent activation of Smad/ERK signaling. Even in vivo experiments have shown that CTGF antagonism with the mAb FG-3019 enhances the chemotherapy response in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, but to some extent that we think is more important, CTGF can promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs, and CAFs can promote chemotherapy resistance. ATL-1 can inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs induced by CTGF and indirectly increase the chemotherapy sensitivity of tumor cells in a co-culture system. CTGF can induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Tsang M et\u00a0al. found that CTGF is required for the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in a murine model of melanoma. As a downstream effector of the profibrotic molecule TGF-\u03b2, CTGF can promote the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts. All these observations support our findings.CTGF expression was reported to be controlled by TGFB1 signaling in fibroblasts and Hippo-YAP signaling in TNBC cells. In our results, we found that CTGF expression was reduced by ATL-1 in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. But the specific activated receptors and signaling pathways need to be further studied. RNA-seq, KEGG and GO analysis will be need for our further research.Our mice model showed that paclitaxel treatment and paclitaxel combined with ATL-1 treatment could reduce tumor volume and numbers of metastasis. Compared with single paclitaxel treatment, the addition of ATL-1 treatment could further enhance therapeutic effect. This was consistent with our results in vitro. But, we did not see any effect on single ATL-1 treatment on metastasis, though we saw ATL-1 treatment could inhibit TNBC cells migration via CTGF in the in-vitro model. Actually, metastasis is facilitated by at least four essential steps: detachment, migration, invasion and adhesion. These four essential, metastatic steps are inter-related and affected by multi-biochemical events and parameters. Just reducing the migration ability by ATL-1 may not be sufficient to reduce tumor metastasis in vivo models. Paclitaxel can cause the death of tumor cells by disrupting the normal microtubule dynamics required for cell division and vital interphase processes. Paclitaxel can significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and metastatic tumors and has been widely used in clinical practice. Although the reduction of CTGF and fibroblasts transformation induced by single ATL-1 treatment were not sufficient to inhibit tumor metastasis, these two steps played key roles in increasing the sensitivity of paclitaxel chemotherapy, and we have seen the enhanced therapeutic effect of the combination therapy in our in vivo models.In summary, our study demonstrated that ATL-1 could inhibit tumor cell migration via downregulation of CTGF in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, ATL-1 reduced the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts and inhibited fibroblast transformation into CAFs. ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. These results indicate that ATL-1 can increase chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and suppress breast cancer metastasis. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ATL-1.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material .

CAFs can modulate drug response by different mechanisms including effects on tumour physiology which regulate tumour drug uptake or paracrine signalling altering cancer cell drug sensitivity 2, 3, 4. CAF\u2010derived markers, such as caveolin, stromal phospho\u2010Erk (pErk), and stroma\u2010derived gene signatures have been linked to sensitivity to chemotherapy and endocrine treatment 5, 6, 7.The PDGF family of growth factors, acting through PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase receptors, act as important regulators of CAFs 8, 9. Previous studies have demonstrated that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is linked to shorter survival in population\u2010based breast and prostate tumour collections 10, 11. Potential impact of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive fibroblasts on drug sensitivity is suggested by mechanistic studies, which have demonstrated that PDGFR\u2010signalling in fibroblasts can regulate treatment efficacy by controlling tumour drug uptake in a manner involving regulation of tumour interstitial fluid pressure 12, 13.Tamoxifen treatment represents a major component of clinical management of early breast cancer. Improved methods for identification of responsive patients remain a critical issue. Experimental and correlative studies have suggested a role for CAF\u2010derived markers as biomarkers for tamoxifen benefit 14, 15, 16.This study extends these earlier findings by analyses of the potential of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 as a tamoxifen\u2010sensitivity biomarker through analyses of two randomised study\u2010derived breast cancer collections.Material and methodsCohort 1Premenopausal patients with stage II (pT1pN1, pT2pN0, pT2pN1) primary breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009564) were randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, in the SBII:2 multicentre trial 17. Radiotherapy was delivered after breast conserving therapy and in patients with axillary lymph node metastases; chemotherapy and ovarian suppression was administered to <2% (nine patients). Median follow\u2010up time was 13.6 years for patients without any event. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks were retrieved from 500/564 patients and a tissue micro array (TMA) with two individual cores was constructed 17. Assessment of ER, PR and HER2 were performed according to clinical protocols 18. For ER\u2010 and PR\u2010status the clinically used cut\u2010point of more than 10% was used.Cohort 2The Stockholm tamoxifen trial included a cohort of 1780 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node negative disease and a tumour size not exceeding 30 mm, randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, irrespective of hormone receptor status. Radiotherapy was administered to patients receiving breast\u2010conserving therapy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given in this group of patients. The trial has previously been described in more detail 19. TMAs with three individual cores were constructed from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumours from 912 patients. The assessments of ER, PR and HER2 with immunohistochemistry have been previously described 20.ImmunohistochemistryPDGFR\u03b2 IHC for the pre\u2010menopausal TMA series was performed as described earlier 21. The post\u2010menopausal TMA series was immunohistochemically stained for PDGFR\u03b2 using the anti\u2010PDGFR\u03b2 antibody (#3169, 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) diluted in antibody diluent (Roche) in the Ventana system (Roche) with the Omnimap kit (5266548001, Roche). The secondary anti\u2010rabbit antibody was used according to manufacturer's instructions (5269679001, Roche). For antigen retrieval high pH buffer was used (T6455, Sigma Aldrich). After staining in the Ventana autostainer samples were dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95, 99%) and xylene and mounted using PERTEX (00871, Histolab). TMAs were then scanned at the tissue profiling facility at SciLifeLab, Uppsala University and pictures taken with the Aperio ImageScope software (v.11.2.0.780, Leica Biosystems). Final scores (0\u20133) were derived from two independent readings from JP and CS blinded to outcome data. In cases of dis\u2010concordance between readings (around 10%) slides were re\u2010visited for new consensus\u2010scoring. Cohort 1 was made with two cores/tumour, whereas cohort 2 was made up of three cores/tumour. Mean\u2010values for individual cores of each tumour were used for subsequent correlation and survival\u2010analyses.Statistical analysesThe association of PDGFR\u03b2 with other clinicopathological factors was evaluated using the \u03c72\u2010test. Time for follow\u2010up was defined as the time from randomisation until the first event, loco\u2010regional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to breast cancer. Survival curves and probabilities of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox hazard regression analysis.ResultsAssociations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological characteristics of early breast cancerTMAs from tumours of two different randomised studies on tamoxifen benefit in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal women 18, 19, was subjected to PDGFR\u03b2 IHC analyses and scored as previously described (Figure 1) 10, 11.Tumour stromal PDGFR\u03b2 immunohistochemical staining in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.

In this group, 65% of cases displayed high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression, whereas 42% of the post\u2010menopausal cases displayed high levels of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (Table 1).Clinico\u2010pathological characteristics and PDGFR\u03b2 status in the pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal cohortsPre\u2010menopausal patients stage II\tPost\u2010menopausal patients\t \t\t\tPDGFR\u03b2 n (%)\t\t\t\tPDGFR\u03b2 n (%)\t\t \tn\t<3+\t3+\tSignificance\tn\t<3+\t3+\tSignificance\t \tAll\t360\t127 (35)\t233 (65)\t\tAll\t528\t306 (58)\t222 (42)\t\t \tNode status\t\t\t\t\tNode status\t\t\t\t\t \tN0\t108\t34 (27)\t74 (32)\t\tN0\t528\t\t\t\t \tN+\t251\t93 (73)\t158 (68)\tp\u2009=\u20090.46\tN+\t0\t\t\t\t \tTumour size\t\t\t\t\tTumour size\t\t\t\t\t \t\u226420 mm\t128\t44 (35)\t84 (36)\t\t\u226420 mm\t385\t213 (71)\t172 (80)\t\t \t>20 mm\t231\t83 (65)\t148 (64)\tp\u2009=\u20090.77\t>20 mm\t132\t88 (29)\t44 (20)\tp\u2009=\u20090.023\t \tER status\t\t\t\t\tER status\t\t\t\t\t \tER+\t204\t72 (65)\t132 (70)\t\tER+\t393\t221 (74)\t172 (78)\t\t \tER\u2212\t97\t39 (35)\t58 (30)\tp\u2009=\u20090.41\tER\u2212\t127\t78 (26)\t49 (22)\tp\u2009=\u20090.31\t \tPgR status\t\t\t\t\tPgR status\t\t\t\t\t \tPgR+\t203\t67 (65)\t136 (71)\t\tPgR+\t236\t136 (49)\t100 (50)\t\t \tPgR\u2212\t241\t36 (35)\t56 (29)\tp\u2009=\u20090.49\tPgR\u2212\t241\t140 (51)\t101 (50)\tp\u2009=\u20090.92\t \tHER2 status\t\t\t\t\tHER2 status\t\t\t\t\t \tHER2\u2212\t226\t77 (82)\t149 (85)\t\tHER2\u2212\t420\t245 (87)\t175 (85)\t\t \tHER2+\t43\t17 (18)\t26 (15)\tp\u2009=\u20090.49\tHER2+\t69\t38 (13)\t31 (15)\tp\u2009=\u20090.61\t \tIn the post\u2010menopausal cohort a significant association (p\u2009=\u20090.023) was detected between high PDGFR\u03b2 expression and small tumour size (Table 1). No significant association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological features were detected in the pre\u2010menopausal group.Impact of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression on RFS in tamoxifen\u2010treated ER+ breast cancerA set of analyses, restricted to ER+ cases, were performed which compared treatment effects in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal subsets defined by stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status.As shown in Figure 2A, a significant benefit of tamoxifen treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.026), measured by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses of RFS, was detected in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group. Strikingly, this significant treatment benefit was not seen in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group. This differential effect of tamoxifen in the two marker\u2010defined patient sub\u2010groups was also seen in Cox regression analyses where treatment was associated with a significant HR in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group (HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)), but not in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group (HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)).(A) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with more than 10% expression of ER in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort. (B) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (0.23\u20130.73)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (0.31\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with >75% expression of ER in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.Initial analyses of the complete post\u2010menopausal cohort yielded results with a trend of reduced tamoxifen benefit in the subset with high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (data not shown). Based on findings from earlier meta\u2010analyses that tamoxifen benefit is most prominent in cases with high ER expression novel analyses were performed on the subset of the post\u2010menopausal cohort with more than 75% ER\u2010positive cells (290 cases out of 393). Interestingly, analyses of this sub\u2010group yielded results similar to those seen in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort with significant tamoxifen\u2010benefit, determined both by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses and Cox hazard regression analyses, detected in the PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate group (HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (95% CI 0.23\u20130.73)), but not in the PDGFR\u03b2 high group (HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (95% CI 0.31\u20131.42)) (Figure 2B).Together these analyses thus indicate that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is a marker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen.DiscussionIn contrast to the majority of studies analysing factors associated with benefit of tamoxifen this study describes previously un\u2010recognised associations between a tumour stroma marker and tamoxifen benefit.Support for the notion that stromal fibroblasts can impact on efficacy of drugs targeting malignant cells, have been presented from analyses of series of cases not derived from randomised studies 6, 7. The earlier analyses of the pre\u2010menopausal cohort of the present study which identified pERK as a marker associated with tamoxifen efficacy, is to our knowledge the only other study which have demonstrated associations between a fibroblast\u2010marker and treatment efficacy based on analyses of randomised studies 5. The present findings thus represent a significant addition in the efforts to translate and consolidate pre\u2010clinical findings by analyses of well\u2010annotated clinical samples.The present study identifies associations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit. Earlier studies have shown that stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status is largely independent from stroma abundance in general or stromal \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positivity 10, 22. These findings therefore suggest that the detected association is not related to stroma abundance but rather reflects more specific biology of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells.This study does not address if the detected association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit reflects a direct involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 signalling in tamoxifen effects, or rather is related to other signalling effects of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells. Concerning the former, findings from model studies have demonstrated effects of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 on tumour drug uptake 13, 23, 24. Paracrine signalling from fibroblasts have also been shown to directly affect drug efficacy 2, 25, 26. Previous experiments have indeed demonstrated tamoxifen\u2010protective effects by co\u2010cultured fibroblasts in tissue culture models 14, 15, 16. According to preliminary studies this effect is not related to PDGFR\u03b2 status of fibroblasts, since also fibroblast with down\u2010regulation of PDGFR\u03b2 displayed a protective effect (data not shown). The clinical associations therefore appear more likely to be related to PDGFR\u03b2\u2010controlled drug exposure. Future studies could explore this possibility be measuring tamoxifen uptake, or ER activity, in tumour samples with known stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status from tamoxifen treated cases.Both cohorts represent randomised clinical trials with long time of follow\u2010up, of importance as patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer frequently experience late relapses. With few exceptions the patients received no other systemic treatment than tamoxifen. A limitation is that the study is retrospective and at the time when the trials were implemented less women than today had breast conserving surgery. Type of surgery had however no influence on the results (data not shown).Based on the results from the present study it seems highly appropriate to integrate fibroblast\u2010related markers, in general, and PDGFR\u03b2, specifically, in future prospective efforts to identify tamoxifen\u2010benefit biomarkers.Author contributionsAll authors provided substantial contributions, were involved in preparation of the manuscript and approved the final version Janna Paulsson: data collection, data analyses, manuscript writing; Lisa Ryd\u00e9n: conception of study, data analyses, manuscript writing; Carina Strell: data collection, data analyses; Oliver Frings: data analyses; Nicholas P.

        "content": "Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed on the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) of the tumor stroma. Recently, we reported the preclinical evaluation and clinical biokinetics of a novel <sup99m</supTc-labeled FAP inhibitor radioligand ([<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP). This research aimed to evaluate [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity. [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP was prepared from freeze-dried kits with a radiochemical purity of 98 \u00b1 1%. The study included thirty-two patients diagnosed with glioma (<in</i = 5); adrenal cortex neuroendocrine tumor (<in</i = 1); and breast (<in</i = 21), lung (<in</i = 2), colorectal (<in</i = 1) and cervical (<in</i = 3) cancer. Patients with glioma had been evaluated with a previous cranial MRI scan and the rest of the patients had been involved in a [<sup18</supF]FDG PET/CT study. All oncological diagnoses were corroborated histopathologically. The patients underwent SPECT/CT brain imaging (glioma) or thoracoabdominal imaging 1 h after [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP administration (i.v., 735 \u00b1 63 MBq). The total lesions (<in</i = 111) were divided into three categories: primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III-IV gliomas and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma. Both [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP and [<sup18</supF]FDG detected 26 (100%) PT, although the number of positive LNm and Dm was significantly higher with [<sup18</supF]FDG [82 (96%)], in comparison to [<sup99m</supTc]Tc-iFAP imaging (35 (41%)).

Recently, we reported the preclinical evaluation and clinical biokinetics of a novel 99mTc-labeled FAP inhibitor radioligand ([99mTc]Tc-iFAP). This research aimed to evaluate [99mTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP was prepared from freeze-dried kits with a radiochemical purity of 98 \u00b1 1%. The study included thirty-two patients diagnosed with glioma (n = 5); adrenal cortex neuroendocrine tumor (n = 1); and breast (n = 21), lung (n = 2), colorectal (n = 1) and cervical (n = 3) cancer. Patients with glioma had been evaluated with a previous cranial MRI scan and the rest of the patients had been involved in a [18F]FDG PET/CT study. All oncological diagnoses were corroborated histopathologically. The patients underwent SPECT/CT brain imaging (glioma) or thoracoabdominal imaging 1 h after [99mTc]Tc-iFAP administration (i.v., 735 \u00b1 63 MBq). The total lesions (n = 111) were divided into three categories: primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma. Both [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG detected 26 (100%) PT, although the number of positive LNm and Dm was significantly higher with [18F]FDG [82 (96%)], in comparison to [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging (35 (41%)). Peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in a patient with recurrent colorectal cancer were only visualized with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. In patients with breast cancer, a significant positive correlation was demonstrated among [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake values (Bq/cm3) of PT and the molecular subtype, being higher for subtypes HER2+ and Luminal B HER2-enriched. Four different CAF subpopulations have previously been described for LNm of breast cancer (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1, which is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2 and triple-negative), confirming that FAP+ is a marker for poor disease prognosis. The results of this pilot clinical research show that [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT imaging is a promising tool in the prognostic assessment of some solid tumors, particularly breast cancer.1. IntroductionTumors are pathological complexes composed of tumor cells and the tumor stroma or tumor microenvironment (TME), which consists of cellular and acellular components, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), macrophages, blood vessels, pericytes, and extracellular matrices (ECM). In fact, CAFs induce a cancer phenotype and are responsible for the production of proteolytic enzymes, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components. CAFs contribute up to 90% of the macroscopic tumor mass, provide mechanical support to tumor cells and control their survival, metastasis, proliferation, and resistance to therapies. CAFs can have different origins, including adipose mesenchymal stem cells, resident tissue fibroblasts and epithelial/endothelial cells, and adipocytes and pericytes that transdifferentiate to mesenchymal cells; therefore, they represent a heterogeneous cell population within the TME.Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a membrane-anchored peptidase expressed by CAFs at the stromal level of various tumor entities and contributes to progression and a worse prognosis. FAP degrades denatured collagens and participates in tumor growth via a non-enzymatic mechanism.Diagnostic FAP inhibitor radiotracers under clinical evaluation use 18F and 68Ga linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine and cyclo-[benzene(trimethanethiol-DOTA)-Met-Pro-Pro-Thr-Glu-Phe-Met] (FAPI-2286) structures, which are radiotracers for PET (positron emission tomography), and only one work has reported 99mTc, also linked to quinolinoyl-cyanopyrrolidine for SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) imaging. Internationally, the amount of equipment available for molecular imaging studies is predominantly higher for gamma cameras (SPECT modality), and they represent more than 70% of the total. For SPECT images, the most-employed radionuclide is 99mTc. Therefore, the need for target-specific radiopharmaceuticals labeled with 99mTc is increasing within the field of oncology. Our group previously reported [99mTc]Tc-((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl) boronic acid ([99mTc]Tc-iFAP) as a new SPECT radioligand capable of specifically detecting FAP expressed by CAFs located in the cancer stroma and, to our knowledge, the first ligand based on 99mTc-labeled boron-Pro derivatives. Furthermore, the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP biokinetic\u2013dosimetric evaluation in healthy volunteers and three cancer patients diagnosed with breast, lung, and cervical cancer showed favorable biokinetics and uptake in primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases, achieving high-quality and high-contrast molecular images.This research aimed to evaluate [99mTc]Tc-iFAP for the tumor stroma imaging of six different cancerous entities and analyze them from the perspective of stromal heterogeneity.2. ResultsNo adverse events related to the diagnostic use of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP were observed. Table 1 shows the general characteristics of patients included in the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging evaluation. A detailed cancer staging of patients is shown in Table A1 (Appendix A). Patient imaging results were categorized into two groups. Patients with gliomas (n = 5), with which SPECT and SPECT/MR images were acquired, were identified as the first group. The second group involves all cases (n = 27) of breast, lung, colon, NET, renal cortex, and cervical cancer, in which SPECT/CT and PET/CT images were obtained.[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT brain imaging was positive in four high-grade WHO III\u2013IV gliomas (T/Bc range 6.3\u201313.9) (Table 2) and negative in one treatment-naive low-grade glioma (Figure 1). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP imaging resolution and contrast were good enough for the high-grade glioma, which could allow the performing of non-invasive diagnoses to differentiate between low- and high-grade gliomas based on their distinct FAP expression. For all cancer cases, a total of 111 lesions were evaluated, which were classified as primary tumors (PT)(n = 26), lymph node metastases (LNm) (n = 61), and distant metastases (Dm) (n = 24) (Table 3). All primary tumors were detected with both [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and [18F]FDG PET/CT (Figure 2 and Figure 3), which did not occur with LNm and Dm lesions (Figure 4 and Figure 5). That is, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT detected PT (100%), LNm (51%), and Dm (17%) in contrast to [18F]FDG PET/CT, which detected PT (100%), LNm (100%), and Dm (88%) (Table 3). The non-detection of LNm and Dm with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP could be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), including those not detected in NT and lung cancer, but not in 39% of the lesions with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Additionally, none of the Dm lesions detected by [18F]FDG in patients with triple negative and luminal B HER2+ molecular subtypes at the bone, liver, and lung exhibited [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake.These results are expected since FAP expression decreases once the cells succeed to invade. FAP is a protein that promotes metastasis; therefore, once the micrometastasis is established in a distant site from the PT, it loses its FAP expression. The signaling mediated by FAP/integrins/PI3K has a negative effect on IGF2 expression (associated with increased glucose uptake). This fact probably explains why as FAP uptake in Dm decreases, FDG uptake increases. As a unique feature of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP images, a very low background was achieved as previously reported (Figure 3). [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake was considerably lower regarding [18F]FDG in patients with cervical cancer and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the adrenal cortex, which agrees with their relatively low FAP expression in comparison to lung and breast cancer (Figure 2). In general, the Dm lesions detected with [18F]FDG did not show [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, except for peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions in recurrent colorectal cancer, which only showed [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake, but not [18F]FDG uptake (Figure 5). CAFs are abundant in mesothelial metastases, and, through the mesothelial-mesenchymal transformation mechanism, it is likely that in carcinomatosis there is a greater transdifferentiation of mesenchymal cells towards CAFs FAP+.When comparing the values obtained from the average tumor-to-background ratios of the different background sites [T/Bm (tumor/mediastinum), T/Bl (tumor/liver) and T/Bp (tumor/psoas muscle)] for all lesions, the highest values were T/Bp for both imaging methods (Figure 6). Although no statistically significant difference was found, the values of the T/Bp ratios were higher with [18F]FDG than with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (Figure 6). In the T/B data, the same trend is observed in terms of a higher uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the primary tumors compared to that obtained in the lymph node and distant metastases (Figure 6).In the case of breast cancer, [99mTc]Tc-iFAP showed a significant positive correlation between the T/Bp value of the primary tumors and the molecular subtype (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.8085), where HER2+ and Luminal B HER2+ enriched subtypes showed the highest T/Bp ratios (Figure 7). The [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake in HER2+ could be associated to the Erb2-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr654 of \u03b2-catenin, which promotes the activation of Wnt signaling pathways and the consequent promotion of the tumor invasive capacity (FAP expression) through a very common mechanism in breast cancer, the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, induced by the microenvironment, which infers the gain of invasive capacity and the arrest of the cell cycle, while, at the signaling level, it implies the repression of E-cadherin expression through snail/slug. In LN metastases, a decrease in T/Bp ratio was observed and there was no significant correlation among the molecular subtypes (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.4027) (Figure 7). 3. DiscussionThe expression of FAP is an indication that the cell is expressing an invasive phenotype associated with an intense process of differentiation, typical of the first stages of carcinogenesis. During this phase, there is an intense activation of signaling pathways aimed at promoting the differentiation of cell precursors towards the activated fibroblast phenotype. As the tumor evolves, the stroma changes genetically and epigenetically to generate the appropriate niche for its stage. Cellular plasticity allows cells to adapt to their microenvironment through reprogramming processes (phenotypic and genotypic modifications) for tumor progression. RNAs produce epigenetic modifications that alter transcription, activating stem cell transformation and EMT processes (including FAP expression), which are essential for invasion to occur. FAP is overexpressed by CAFs from various tumor entities, making it a promising biomarker and target for many medical interventions. CAF subpopulations (from CAF-S1 to CAF-S4) are classified depending on the expression of six markers: integrin b1/CD29, \u03b1-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin), PDGFR-\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), CAV1 (caveolin 1), and S100-A4/FSP1 (fibroblast-specific protein 1). The only subpopulation that expresses FAP is CAF-S1 (CAF-S1 FAP+).In their study, Kratochwil et al. demonstrated the elevated and selective uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-04 in the stroma of multiple tumors, including breast, lung, colorectal, and NET cancer. However, this research demonstrated the tumor stroma imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP as the first SPECT radioligand based on a boron-Pro derivative.The results showed that the detection of primary tumor lesions with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is consistent when compared with [18F]FDG. However, when detecting LNm and Dm, the superiority of [18F]FDG is clear. This fact can be attributed to the lower spatial resolution of the SPECT technique in 61% of the lesions (size < 8 mm), but not in 39% of the tumors with dimensions greater than 8 mm and associated to breast cancer. Thus, our findings are discussed from the perspective of tumor stroma heterogeneity in lesions with enough size to be detected by SPECT. As mentioned, the dynamics of differentiation in the tumor microenvironment are attributed to genetic and non-genetic changes in tumor cells, the composition of the extracellular matrix, cell\u2013cell interactions, and cell heterogeneity. Based on this, it is likely that the increased uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP by primary tumors due to the presence of increased amounts of CAF-S1 FAP+ indicates an active EMT process, which is known to happen in the early phases of carcinogenesis, through which the dissemination of cells from the primary mass to distant sites is promoted. EMT involves the regulation of both intercellular adhesions by decreasing E-cadherin and increasing N-cadherin, as well as substrate adhesions through integrin mediated primarily by TGF-B, \u03b2-catenin, and the Wnt signaling pathway.On the other hand, hypoxic and hypoglycemic tumor stroma synergistically promotes the EMT phenotype in carcinomas. Thus, tumors where GLUT1 expression is commonly increased will also have an inability to express an (invasive) EMT phenotype. Accordingly, it is likely that the lack of uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in LNm and Dm is related to the fact that in this type of lesion there is an increase in the expression of GLUT1 receptors that leads to an increase in glucose metabolism, which produces a rise in the uptake of [18F]FDG and, at the same time, inhibits EMT (including FAP expression). The neoplasm with the largest number of patients in this study was breast cancer, which showed a significant positive correlation in PT between the T/Bp value and the molecular subtypes, with the highest T/Bp ratios for the HER2+ and Luminal B subtypes HER2+. The T/Bp values in HER2+ breast cancer showed a significant decrease in the LN metastases regarding PT (Figure 7), which may be due to crosstalking (cross-regulation), which occurs between integrins and EGFR receptors, such as HER2. Additionally, it is known that the Wnt signaling pathway promotes the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells in a HER2-dependent manner. It was recently confirmed that the expression of HER2 in the cell membrane is heterogeneous and that the accumulation of HER2 occurs in regions where adhesion to the extracellular matrix is dynamic. Therefore, HER2 expression decreases in regions where focal adhesions are concentrated, and the relative local decrease in HER2 expression in LNm, compared to PT, is probably related to the metastatic process. As a relevant point, it is noted that the presence of CAFs in the tumor stroma of breast cancer is associated with resistance to immunotherapy, since the elements secreted by CAFs derived from HER2+ tumors regulate resistance to treatment in a paracrine way. Thus, the decrease in [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake by LNm could indicate greater sensitivity to trastuzumab treatment.Highly-relevant data have been reported on axillary LNm in breast cancer: (1) the stroma represents around 25\u201330% of the invaded areas (regardless of subtype); (2) the predominant CAF subpopulations are CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (the latter being the most abundant); (3) CAFs enrichments are different in LNm compared to PT; (4) the secretion of CXCL12\u03b2 by CAF-S1 and the expression of CXCR4 in cancer cells is involved in the initiation of EMT and in the distant metastatic process, particularly in lung and bone; and (5) the global stromal content in LNm provides a prognostic stratification of breast cancer patients and, therefore, the CAF-S1/CAF-S4 abundance status exhibits a prognostic value, since both present pro-invasive properties with different modes of action; however, CAF-S4 is known to have a greater impact on distant metastatic spread (Dm), particularly on the liver.CAF-S1 FAP+ promotes an immunosuppressive environment by secreting CXCL12\u03b2, promoting the presence of CD4+CD25+ T cells, increasing T cell survival, and promoting the cell differentiation into CD25+FOXP3+ cells. The ability of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to inhibit the proliferation of effector T cells is also enhanced by CAF-S1. CAF-S4 is highly contractile and induces cancer cell invasion in three dimensions through Notch signaling. CAF-S1 FAP+ is preferentially detected in aggressive subtypes (HER2+ and triple negative), confirming that FAP+ is a poor prognostic marker.Summarizing, the relatively low performance of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in detecting LNm and Dm may be related to the molecular biology of cancer and the proportion of the enrichment of CAF-S1 FAP+, which is not the most abundant in metastatic lesions (LN or distant) (Figure 8). Even when the FAP expression is associated with a phenotype that tends to transmigration and proliferation, attention must be placed on the fact that its expression is temporary and that it depends largely on the tumor microenvironment dynamics; thus, when the characteristics of the tumor stroma are modified, FAP expression and cancer prognosis can change.Our results differ from the work of K\u00f6mek et al., where they showed that PET/CT [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 is superior to [18F]FDG in the detection of primary mammary lesions and metastases (ganglionic and visceral) in twenty patients with breast cancer, both in primary and recurrent lesions, although the average size of the evaluated LNm was 10 mm. On the other hand, Backhaus et al. evaluated the use of PET/MRI with the ligand [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT in 19 women with breast cancer with evidence of high uptake in the primary lesions (mean diameter of 26 mm) and LNm (average diameter of 21 mm). Our results probably vary from the previous research carried out due to the heterogeneity of the sample with respect to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer, the image acquisition time, and the different image acquisition method (SPECT/CT vs. PET/CT vs. PET/MRI). The dynamic behavior of FAP is firmly associated with its functions in the progression phase during cancer evolution (tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix degradation, the promotion of tumor proliferation, and immunomodulation), which deserves to be used as a tool for the detection of the heterogeneity of the tumor stroma in the different stages of cancer through molecular imaging with specific radiotracers, such as [99mTc]Tc-iFAP. Therefore, additional clinical studies must be performed, including the results of the ex vivo FAP expression in tumors (immunohistochemical evaluation) to be correlated with the uptake of FAP inhibitory radiotracers. Today, CAFs is receiving considerable attention in the field of cancer biology. Targeted CAF therapy can potentially inhibit metastasis and cancer progression by reducing immunosuppression and remodeling the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic targeting of FAP has been described in different modalities, such as vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and nanoparticles. In preclinical studies, CAF-S1 FAP+ has shown to cause resistance to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and reduce antitumor immunity. CAFs from breast, ovarian, lung, pancreas, and colon cancer have shown expression of PD-L1 and/or PD-L2; particularly the CAF-S1 FAP+ subset. Additionally, the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation is an important source of CXCL12 secretion, which plays a crucial role in resistance to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies in pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer.Taking into account the deleterious effect of metastases on the survival of breast cancer patients, our data could heighten the interest in evaluating the abundance of the CAF-S1 FAP+ subpopulation, in vivo, in a non-invasive manner, by means of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT in axillary LNm during the initial clinical approach (staging) to determine the prognosis and the benefit of therapies, such as anti-FAP, anti-TGF\u03b2, anti-CXCR4, and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy, in combination with standard therapies (Figure 8). More prospective research is needed to enrich the information obtained so far and we believe that future research can be focused on the function of FAP ligands in different molecular and histological subtypes of breast cancer, as well as their potential in detecting relapse of the disease, in the evaluation of the response to therapy and the prognosis of the patient.Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a complication of various malignant tumors and is generally associated with a poor prognosis. The superiority of uptake by [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in peritoneal carcinomatosis, due to recurrent colon cancer observed in the patient included in this study, agrees with the findings previously described, demonstrating a greater sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 for the detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with various types of cancer.The findings observed in patients with glioma coincide with the data previously reported by R\u00f6hrich et al., where they showed little or no uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-02 and FAPI-04 in low-grade WHO II gliomas and high uptake in gliomas of high WHO III-IV grade, regardless of HDI status; therefore, its usefulness could lie mainly in the differentiation of tumor recurrence versus post-treatment changes and in surgical and/or radiotherapy planning, for which more prospective studies are needed in this regard.4. Materials and Methods4.1. ReagentsAn iFAP (boron-Pro ligand) lyophilized kit for 99mTc labeling was obtained from the National Institute of Nuclear Research (ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico) with GMP certification. [99mTc]TcO4Na was eluted from a generator (99Mo/99mTc GETEC, ININ, Ocoyoacac, Mexico). Other reagents were received from Millipore Co. (Burlington, MA, USA). 4.2. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP PreparationAfter the reconstitution of the iFAP lyophilized kit with a [99mTc]TcO4Na/0.2 M phosphate buffer (1:1 v/v, 2 mL, 740 MBq) solution and incubation in a block heater (92 \u00b0C, 15 min), the [99mTc]Tc-iFAP radioligand was obtained with a radiochemical purity (R.P.) greater than 98% (HPLC, Discovery C18 column, 5 \u00b5m particle size, I.D. of 0.46 cm, length of 25 cm; Supelco, Millipore, Burling-ton, MA, USA; coupled to a UV\u2013Vis detector and a radiometric detector), applying the following linear gradient: a flow rate of 1 mL/min, 0.1% TFA/water (A) (from 100 to 50%, over 10 min, maintained for 10 min, 30% over 5 min, and returned to 100% over 5 min) and 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile (B). As previously reported, the lyophilized formulation contains the HYNIC-iFAP (((R)-1-((6-hydrazinylnicotinoyl)-D-alanyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)boronic) ligand with a specific alignment to the corresponding regions of the FAP binding site, stannous chloride as a reducing agent, as well as ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) to complete the coordination sphere of the [Tc(V)]HYNIC core (Figure 9).The chemical characterization of the iFAP ligand included analysis by mass spectrometry (UPLC-mass), 1H\u2013NMR, UV\u2013Vis and FT-IR. Radiochemical characterization included reversed-phase radio-HPLC and ITLC-SG (instant thin layer chromatography-silica gel) with the following mobile phases: 2-butanone, 0.1 M sodium citrate, and ammonium acetate-methanol (1:1 v/v), as reported in detail previously.4.3. PatientsThirty-two patients (mean \u00b1 SD age, 50.8 \u00b1 16.7 years; 28 women and 4 men) with different types of cancer (breast cancer (n = 21), lung cancer (n = 2), adrenal cortex NETs (n = 1), colorectal cancer (n = 1), cervical cancer (n = 3) and gliomas (n = 5)) were included.The patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 (n = 5 gliomas) and Group 2 (n = 27 breast, lung, colon, renal cortex NET, and cervical cancer). The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 and with a detailed clinical description in Appendix A (Table A1). All oncological diagnoses were determined histopathologically (Table 2).The patients underwent SPECT/CT 1\u20133 h (with an average of 2 h) after the intravenous application of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5MBq). In Group 1, only of the brain region, and in Group 2, the thoracoabdominal region. The tumor/background ratio is optimal for diagnostic images from 30 min post-injection. However, it was decided 2 h after radiotracer administration to improve the contrast of the images (lesions vs. background). The acquisition protocol and the post-injection waiting time were the same for all types of cancer evaluated. However, in patients with cervical cancer or pelvic etiology, immediate image acquisition was performed post-micturition to reduce the artifact of radiotracer accumulation in the urine.All patients in Group 1 had previous cranial MRI (6 \u00b1 1 days interval) and patients in Group 2 had previous [18F]FDG PET/CT studies carried out (11 \u00b1 12.6 days interval).This research was performed in the Department of Nuclear Medicine of the National Cancer Institute (INCan), Mexico. The patients signed an informed consent declaration, and the protocol was approved by the institutional Nuclear Medicine Ethics Committee. 4.4. Image Acquisition[99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT images were acquired with a dual-head gamma camera (SPECT/CT, Symbia TruePoint, Siemens, Malvern, PA, USA), with low-energy, high-resolution collimators; parameters: window at 140 keV, matrix size of 128 \u00d7 128, with dispersion correction, 90 images of 8 s, rotation of 360 degrees. For the attenuation correction map, the low-dose CT parameters were obtained. A Butterworth filter (cutoff: 0.5, 5th order) and an iterative method (8 iterations /4 subsets) were used for the reconstruction of the raw data.SPECT/CT images were acquired 2 h after the intravenous administration of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP (735 \u00b1 63.5 MBq). The anatomical region studied in Group 1 was only the brain and in Group 2 it was thoracoabdominal. Activity in regions of interest was quantified, via 3D imaging, as Bq/cm3.All patients in Group 2 had undergone a prior PET/CT (Excel 20) scan (Siemens Medical Solutions), performed at 1 h after [18F]FDG administration (CT: slice thickness of 5 mm, 180 mAs and 120 kVp). Whole-body scans were obtained in 3D mode from the vertex to mid-thighs (2\u20133 min per bed position). PET images were reconstructed using a two-dimensional expectation algorithm of ordered subsets.4.5. Image AnalysisImages obtained with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP and [18F]FDG were examined on a Siemens VG60 multimodal workstation. Visual and semi-quantitative analyses were performed by two physicians with more than 9 years of experience in nuclear medicine and molecular imaging (workstation with processing software for volumetric analysis).Visual analysis was performed on both groups of patients. Uptake was compared with the morphology of the corresponding lesion using CT and/or MRI, depending on the patient group. The detected lesions were divided into three categories for study: primary tumor (PT), lymph node metastases (LNm), and distant metastases (Dm). The semiquantitative analysis of lesion uptake was obtained by calculating the tumor-to-background ratio (T/B) with spherical volumes of interest (VOIs) to homogenize the data obtained with both radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, in Group 2, the concordance of uptake between both radiotracers was compared by quantifying the number of lesions (PT, LNm, and Dm).4.6. Tumor Tissue SamplesAll patients underwent a biopsy of the primary tumor lesion. Histopathology was used to determine the existence of viable tumor tissue and to verify the diagnosis. The histopathological reports were interpreted by a certified and experienced pathologist.4.7. Statistical AnalysisThe Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the T/Bp [99mTc]Tc-iFAP values and the molecular subtypes of the patients with breast cancer; a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.5. ConclusionsThe results of this pilot study show that SPECT imaging with [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is a promising and potentially useful tool in the evaluation of the tumor microenvironment of multiple solid neoplastic entities. Within the different types of cancer that we included, we observed a potential panorama in the prognostic evaluation of recently diagnosed breast cancer, as well as its probable diagnostic superiority in peritoneal carcinomatosis in recurrent colon cancer. [18F]FDG was superior to [99mTc]Tc-iFAP in the detection of LNm and Dm. However, with the analyses carried out, we can establish that the role of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP is not to displace metabolic molecular imaging, but rather that it serves as a complement for an adequate prognostic evaluation.Further prospective [99mTc]Tc-iFAP clinical studies are needed to define the clinical impact of the non-invasive in vivo detection of FAP in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and its implication in determining candidates for immunotherapy and target therapy combined with conventional therapies.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization, G.F.-F., P.V.-A., E.A.-V. and M.L.-G.; methodology, P.V.-A., M.L.-G., P.C.-T. and B.S.-B.; formal analysis, P.V.-A., C.S.-C., G.F.-F., F.O.G.-P., B.O.-G. and E.A.-V.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.V.-A. and G.F.-F.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.F.-F.; funding acquisition, M.L.-G. and C.S.-C.

However, low-grade glioma (WHO II) did not show uptake.(a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and (b) [18F]FDG PET/CT images of the primary tumors of three different types of cancers.

(a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP MIP, (b) [18F]FDG MIP, (c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT, and (d) [18F]FDG PET/CT. All primary lesions show concordant uptake between both molecular imaging methods. [99mTc]Tc-iFAP uptake is decreased in pure hormonal molecular subtypes (Luminal A and B) and elevated in subtypes with HER2+ expression (Luminal B HER2+ and pure HER2+). The triple negative subtype shows moderate and heterogeneous uptake. MIP: maximum intensity projection.Lymph node metastases in breast cancer. (a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/T and (b) [18F]FDG PET/CT.

(a,c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT and (b,d) [18F]FDG PET/CT. All distant metastatic lesions are hypermetabolic; however, most of them (arrowhead) exhibit decreased or no uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP.

In LN metastases, a decrease in T/Bp is observed and there is no significant difference among the molecular subtypes (Pearson correlation coefficient: r = 0.4027).  mode and \u00b0 = outliers.CAF subpopulations as prognostic markers in breast cancer (in diagnosis). Four CAF subpopulations have been reported in the lymph node metastases of breast cancer (CAF-S1 to CAF-S4). The most relevant and predominant are CAF-S1 FAP+ and CAF-S4 FAP-. Pelon et al. established a model of clinical application to the knowledge generated from the different subpopulations, in such a way that a prognostic impact is proposed according to the predominance of CAFs as follows: if at the time of diagnosis the patient exhibits low content of CAF-S1 FAP+ in LNm, they present a low risk of late Dm ((a) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-), no uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal A breast cancer); on the other hand, if high levels of CAF-S1 FAP+ are demonstrated in LNm, the risk of distant metastasis increases ((b) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(+), uptake in left axillary adenopathy of Luminal B HER2+ breast cancer). Finally, in distant metastatic lesions, only CAF-S4 FAP- is expressed [(c) [99mTc]Tc-iFAP SPECT/CT(-) in lung Dm and extremely low uptake in some right axillary lymph nodes that exhibit hypermetabolism with [18F]FDG; likewise, (d) multiple lung and liver metastases did not exhibit uptake of [99mTc]Tc-iFAP].

        "content": "In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), signaling from stromal cells is implicated in metastatic progression. Tumor-stroma cross-talk is often mediated through extracellular vesicles (EVs). We previously reported that EVs derived from cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts (CAFs) that are abundant in annexin A6 (ANXA6<sup+</sup EVs) support tumor cell aggressiveness in PDAC. Here, we found that the cell surface glycoprotein and tetraspanin CD9 is a key component of CAF-derived ANXA6<sup+</sup EVs for mediating this cross-talk. CD9 was abundant on the surface of ANXA6<sup+</sup CAFs isolated from patient PDAC samples and from various mouse models of PDAC. CD9 colocalized with CAF markers in the tumor stroma, and CD9 abundance correlated with tumor stage. Blocking CD9 impaired the uptake of ANXA6<sup+</sup EVs into cultured PDAC cells. Signaling pathway arrays and further analyses revealed that the uptake of CD9<sup+</supANXA6<sup+</sup EVs induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activity, cell migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Blocking either CD9 or p38 MAPK signaling impaired CD9<sup+</supANXA6<sup+</sup EV-induced cell migration and EMT in PDAC cells. Analysis of bioinformatic datasets indicated that CD9 abundance was an independent marker of poor prognosis in patients with PDAC. Our findings suggest that CD9-mediated stromal cell signaling promotes PDAC progression.",
