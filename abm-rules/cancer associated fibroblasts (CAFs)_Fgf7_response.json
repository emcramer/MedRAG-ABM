    "## Potential Rules for Fgf7 in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) Here are some potential rules for Fgf7 in CAFs, based on the provided documents, formatted as requested: **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Fgf7 increases proliferation. **Justification:** FGF7 is a potent mitogen for a variety of cell types, including fibroblasts. Several studies have shown that FGF7 can promote fibroblast proliferation, including in the context of cancer. (Document [13], Document [24], Document [33], Document [43], Document [62]) **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Fgf7 increases migration speed. **Justification:** FGF7 has been shown to promote fibroblast migration in various contexts, including in the tumor microenvironment. (Document [13], Document [24], Document [33], Document [43], Document [62]) **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Fgf7 increases ECM production. **Justification:** FGF7 can stimulate the production of extracellular matrix (ECM) components by fibroblasts. This is particularly relevant in the context of cancer, where CAFs contribute to ECM remodeling and tumor progression. (Document [13], Document [24], Document [33], Document [43], Document [62]) **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Fgf7 increases the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors. **Justification:** FGF7 can stimulate the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors by fibroblasts, such as VEGF. This contributes to the formation of new blood vessels, which is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. (Document [13], Document [24], Document [33], Document [43], Document [62]) **Rule 5:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Fgf7 increases the expression of FGFR2. **Justification:** FGF7 is a ligand for FGFR2, and its binding can lead to increased expression of the receptor. This creates a positive feedback loop, amplifying the effects of FGF7 signaling. (Document [24], Document [33], Document [43], Document [62]) **Rule 6:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, TGF-\u03b2 decreases Fgf7 secretion. **Justification:** TGF-\u03b2 is a potent regulator of fibroblast function, and it has been shown to suppress the expression of FGF7 in fibroblasts. This suggests that TGF-\u03b2 signaling can counteract the effects of FGF7 in the tumor microenvironment. (Document [24], Document [33], Document [43], Document [62]) **Rule 7:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, high levels of Fgf7 are associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype. **Justification:** FGF7 is a potent pro-tumorigenic factor, and its overexpression in CAFs has been linked to increased tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. (Document [13], Document [24], Document [33], Document [43], Document [62]) **Rule 8:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, high levels of Fgf7 are associated with a lower response to EGFR TKIs. **Justification:** FGF7 can activate FGFR2, which can bypass EGFR signaling and promote resistance to EGFR TKIs. (Document [24], Document [33], Document [43], Document [62]) These rules are based on the available information in the provided documents. However, it is important to note that these are just potential rules and further research is needed to validate them. The specific effects of Fgf7 in CAFs may vary depending on the specific tumor type, the genetic background of the cells, and the presence of other signaling molecules in the tumor microenvironment. "
