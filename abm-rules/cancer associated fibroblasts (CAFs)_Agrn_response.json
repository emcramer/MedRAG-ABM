    "I am sorry, but I cannot provide any rules for the signal \"Agrn\" and the cell type \"cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs)\" based on the provided documents. The provided documents do not contain any information about the interaction of \"Agrn\" with \"CAFs\". To generate rules for your agent-based model, you will need to find research papers that specifically investigate the interaction of \"Agrn\" with \"CAFs\" in the context of triple-negative breast cancer. Once you have identified relevant research papers, I can help you to formulate rules in the desired format. "
