    "I apologize, but I cannot provide any rules for the signal \"Lair1\" and the cell type \"cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs)\" based on the provided documents. The reason is that the provided documents do not contain any information about the signal \"Lair1\" or its interaction with CAFs. The documents focus on other signals and their effects on CAFs, such as: * **miR-9:** This microRNA is secreted by TNBC cells and promotes the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAF-like cells (Document [1] and [10]). * **TGF-\u03b2:** This growth factor is secreted by both cancer cells and CAFs and promotes fibrosis and cancer progression (Document [6] and [19]). * **IFN-\u03b3:** This cytokine can suppress the proliferation of M2 macrophages and enhance the phagocytosis of dead cells by M1 macrophages (Document [1]). * **COX-2:** This enzyme is expressed by TNBC cells and alters the structure and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the number of CAFs (Document [3]). * **HGF:** This growth factor is secreted by CAFs and activates MET receptor tyrosine kinase in TNBC cells, promoting invasiveness and EMT (Document [20]). * **FGF2:** This growth factor is secreted by CAFs and stimulates breast cancer cell progression by activating Akt (Document [21]). * **IL-1\u03b2:** This cytokine is upregulated by hypoxia and promotes aggressive features in both TNBC cells and CAFs (Document [9]). * **miR-222:** This microRNA is upregulated in CAFs and controls CAF-like expression profiles (Document [13]). * **miR-4516:** This microRNA is downregulated in CAF-derived exosomes and is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression (Document [15]). * **Biglycan:** This secreted protein is upregulated in CAFs and is a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Document [7]). * **CXCL12:** This chemokine is secreted by CAFs and promotes resistance to docetaxel in TNBC cells (Document [5]). * **CXCL5:** This chemokine is secreted by CAFs and promotes resistance to paclitaxel in TNBC cells (Document [12]). * **EFEMP1:** This ECM glycoprotein is a target of miR-9 and its downregulation contributes to the acquisition of pro-tumoral properties in normal fibroblasts (Document [10]). * **LBR:** This protein is a direct target of miR-222 and its knockdown phenocopies miR-222 overexpression (Document [13]). * **ITGB4:** This integrin is overexpressed in TNBC cells and induces BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs (Document [17]). * **S100A4:** This protein is upregulated in CAFs and is associated with poor prognosis in TNBC (Document [27]). * **FOSL1:** This protein is a target of miR-4516 and its overexpression promotes TNBC proliferation (Document [15]). * **STAB1 and TREM2:** These proteins are expressed by a lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (Document [12]). Therefore, I need more information about \"Lair1\" and its potential role in CAFs to generate any rules. Please provide additional context or research papers that mention this signal and its interaction with CAFs. "
