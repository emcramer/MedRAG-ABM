    "## Potential Rules for CAFs and Ptprc (CD45) Signal: **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Ptprc (CD45) decreases transform to activated from 0 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** CD45 is a pan-leukocyte marker, and CAFs are not immune cells. Therefore, the presence of CD45 would indicate contamination with immune cells, which could potentially activate CAFs. This rule reflects the suppression of CAF activation in the presence of immune cells. [Document 5] **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Ptprc (CD45) decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** The presence of immune cells, indicated by CD45, could potentially trigger a response in CAFs, such as increased migration towards the source of the signal. This rule reflects the potential for CAFs to become less motile in the presence of immune cells. [Document 5] **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Ptprc (CD45) increases transform to M1 from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10. **Justification:** Macrophages, a type of immune cell, are often found in the tumor microenvironment and can be polarized towards the M1 phenotype, which is associated with anti-tumor activity. This rule reflects the potential for CAFs to be re-educated towards the M1 phenotype upon encountering immune cells. [Document 5] **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Ptprc (CD45) decreases transform to M2 from 0.01 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** M2 macrophages are associated with immunosuppression and tumor promotion. This rule reflects the potential for CAFs to shift away from the M2 phenotype in the presence of immune cells. [Document 5] **Rule 5:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Ptprc (CD45) increases pro-inflammatory factor secretion from 0 towards 10 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** The presence of immune cells, indicated by CD45, could trigger a pro-inflammatory response in CAFs. This rule reflects the potential for CAFs to secrete pro-inflammatory factors in response to immune cell presence. [Document 5] **Rule 6:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Ptprc (CD45) decreases anti-inflammatory factor secretion from 10 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the potential for CAFs to suppress anti-inflammatory factor secretion in the presence of immune cells, potentially contributing to a more pro-inflammatory environment. [Document 5] **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific research question and the specific triple-negative breast cancer model you are using. "
