    "## Potential Rules for CAFs and Cd55: **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Cd55 decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** While the documents provided don't directly mention Cd55's effect on CAF migration, Document [2] highlights the role of CAFs in promoting an immunosuppressive environment. Cd55, also known as decay-accelerating factor (DAF), is a complement regulatory protein that inhibits the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) on cell surfaces. The MAC is a key component of the complement system, which is a part of the innate immune system. Therefore, it's plausible that increased Cd55 expression on CAFs could lead to a decrease in their migration speed, as they may be less susceptible to complement-mediated lysis and thus less likely to be eliminated by the immune system. This would allow them to remain in the tumor microenvironment and continue to promote tumor growth and immunosuppression. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Cd55 increases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [10] discusses the role of CAFs in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which can accelerate tumor progression. Cd55, as a complement regulatory protein, can protect cells from complement-mediated lysis. This protection could allow CAFs to survive and proliferate in the tumor microenvironment, potentially leading to their activation and further promotion of tumor growth. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), Cd55 decreases secretion of inflammatory factors from 10 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Document [2] mentions that CAFs can promote an immunosuppressive environment by attracting and retaining CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes. Cd55, as a complement regulatory protein, can protect cells from complement-mediated lysis. This protection could allow CAFs to survive and proliferate in the tumor microenvironment, potentially leading to a shift towards a more immunosuppressive phenotype, characterized by reduced secretion of inflammatory factors. **Note:** These rules are based on plausible connections between Cd55 and CAF behavior, but further research is needed to confirm their validity.
