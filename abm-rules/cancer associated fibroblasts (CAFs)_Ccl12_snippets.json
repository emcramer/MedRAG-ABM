        "title": "Mechanism of GPER promoting proliferation, migration and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells through CAF.",
        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

This microenvironment provides all the necessary stimuli for tumour survival, growth, and invasiveness. Inflammatory cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines they produce are essential components of this microenvironment.Monocytes originating from blood differentiate into either M1 or M2 subtype macrophages, depending on the environmental stimuli they receive. Human M1 macrophages demonstrate elevated expressions of CD14, CD16, CD64, CD86, and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR\u03b1; whereas, CD163 and CD206 are markers associated with M2 macrophages. In breast cancer, macrophages represent up to 50% of the tumour mass and there exists a correlation between the number of tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) and poor prognosis. Macrophages have roles in almost all stages of tumour progression. In the primary tumour, they stimulate angiogenesis and facilitate invasion. During metastasis, macrophages prepare the pre-metastatic site and promote tumour cell dissemination as well as growth. They also generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment by disrupting natural killer (NK) and T cell functions. TAMs usually resemble M2 macrophages. During tumour development, tumour-infiltrating M1-polarized macrophages are generally identified by an IL-12high IL-10low phenotype and they enhance immune reactions that display anti-tumour effects. During late-stages of tumour progression, TAMs generally skew to an M2-like phenotype that is characterized by an IL-12low IL-10high phenotype and diminished tumouricidal activity. The identification of molecules driving macrophage plasticity in the cancer microenvironment could provide a basis for macrophage-focused diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Fibroblasts are one of the most abundant cell types found in the tumour stroma. Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. As tumours are described as \u201cwounds that never heal\u201d, CAFs are very similar to myofibroblasts, which are spindle shaped activated fibroblasts. Although there is no specific marker that is exclusively expressed by CAFs, alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) is widely used as a CAF marker. CAFs not only play an active role in tumour initiation and progression, but also sculpt the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as regulators of immune cell recruitment as well as functions. Studies in breast cancer investigating the effects of stromal fibroblasts on monocytes/macrophages are very limited. In this study, we report for the first time that CAFs obtained from invasive breast cancer differentiated monocytes to M2-like pro-tumoural macrophages in terms of both phenotypic features and functions, in contrast to fibroblasts obtained from normal breast. We also demonstrated that CAFs were very effective in recruiting monocytes. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) were found to be crucial monocyte chemotactic cytokines that were secreted from stromal cells.ResultsCAFs, which are \u03b1-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to NFs, effectively recruit monocytesCAFs are \u03b1-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to NFs. CAFs and NFs were cultured in 8-well chamber slides, then stained for vimentin (A,D), pan-cytokeratin (B,E) and \u03b1-SMA (C,F). Both CAF and NF cells were positive for vimentin and negative for pan-cytokeratin. However, CAFs were positive for \u03b1-SMA, unlike NFs. Sup. Figure\u00a01 displays immunocytochemical stainings for fibroblast activation protein (FAP). One representative figure for each cell type is shown (\u00d7100).CAFs were isolated from breast cancer tissues obtained from patients undergoing mastectomy. As healthy counterparts, we used normal fibroblasts (NFs) isolated from normal breast tissues obtained from patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty. Primary cultures of both of those isolated fibroblasts were established. All fibroblasts utilized in the experiments were characterized by vimentin, pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-SMA expressions by immunocytochemistry. They differed in their expressions of \u03b1-SMA, which was consistently negative in NFs (n\u2009=\u20093) and positive in CAFs (n\u2009=\u20094). Representative figures of NFs and CAFs are shown in Fig.\u00a01.CAF and MDA-MB-231 cells effectively recruit monocytes. Monocytes isolated from healthy donors were serum starved and then were allowed to migrate for 5\u2009h toward CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) Representative microscopic views of each condition are shown (i: Standard Medium, ii: CM from NFs, iii: CM from CAFs, iv: CM from MDA-MB-231 Cells). (B) CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in monocyte migration more than NFs did. The presence of CXCR4 (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml) or MCP-1 (130\u2009\u00b5g/ml) blocking antibodies diminished monocyte recruitment. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. standard medium, #p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. each corresponding control. Arrows demonstrate migrated/counted monocytes.In order to evaluate the effects of CAFs and breast cancer cells on monocyte recruitment, we performed cell migration assays. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy humans. Conditioned mediums (CMs) collected from CAFs, NFs, and breast cancer cells were used in a Boyden migration assay, in which monocytes migrate toward CM in the bottom chamber. Our results demonstrated that CAFs as well as breast cancer cells recruited monocytes effectively (Fig.\u00a02A,B).Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by MCP-1 as well as SDF-1 cytokinesIn order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying monocyte recruitment by CAFs, we focused on MCP-1 and SDF-1 cytokines. Our results showed that inhibiting MCP-1 or SDF-1 activity through MCP-1 or CXCR4 (a chemokine receptor specific for SDF-1) blocking antibodies, respectively, reduced monocyte migration, significantly. Although both SDF-1 and MCP-1 are relevant for monocyte recruitment mediated by both CAF and breast cancer cells; SDF-1 seems to be more important for CAF-induced monocyte recruitment, while MCP-1 is more prominent for breast cancer cell mediated monocyte migration (Fig.\u00a02B).CAFs induce a pro-tumoural phenotype, which resembles M2 macrophages like TAMs, in monocytes/macrophages in contrast to NFsCAF and MDA-MB-231 cells induce monocytes to differentiate into a M2 phenotype similar to TAMs. CD14+ PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured with CMs from NFs (NF-educated monocytes), CAFs (CAF-educated monocytes), MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes) or standard culture medium DMEM (control monocytes) for 7 days, then were analysed using flow cytometry. (A) The expression levels of PD-1, CD163, and CD206 were significantly higher in CAF-educated monocytes than in NF-educated monocytes. The expression levels of HLA-DR and CD14 were significantly lower in CAF-educated monocytes than in NF-educated monocytes. Representative histograms of each molecule are shown. (B) Data are presented as relative fold changes to control IgG in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.We established an in vitro model utilizing CD14+ cells isolated from healthy donors and CMs obtained from CAFs, NFs, and breast cancer cells in order to investigate the effects of the tumour stromal cells as well as the tumour cells on monocyte differentiation. Following 7 days of culture, the expressions of CD163 and CD206, which are mostly associated with M2 macrophages, were higher in CAF-educated cells than in NF-educated cells. In addition, the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was higher in CAF-educated cells than in NF-educated cells. In fact, NF-educated cells\u2019 expressions of PD-1, CD163 and CD206 were similar to control monocytes. On the other hand, the expression of CD14 was much higher in NF-educated cells than in CAF-educated cells. In addition, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR) expression of CAF-educated cells is much lower than that of NF-educated cells as well as breast cancer cell-educated monocytes. The expressions of CD86 were comparable between the groups (Fig.\u00a03).CAF-educated monocytes exhibit strong immunosuppressionCAF-educated monocytes suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation more than NF-educated monocytes did. CAF-educated monocytes, NF-educated monocytes, MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes, control monocytes were co-cultured with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelled and autologous CD4+ T cells that were activated by CD3/CD28 magnetic beads for 96\u2009hours. (A) The proliferation of T cells was suppressed by CAF-educated monocytes more strongly than control and NF-educated monocytes. Suppression of T-cell proliferation by CAF-educated monocytes is E:T dependent (normalized percentage of suppression of T-cell proliferation considering respective control monocytes are 40.1% and 53.3% for 1:4 and 1:2 E:Ts, respectively). (B) Representative histograms of the proliferation of T cells (monocytes:CD4+ T cells, 1:4). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.We investigated whether CAF-educated monocytes could inhibit T-cell proliferation. For this purpose, human autologous CD4+ peripheral T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads were co-cultured with control monocytes, NF-, or CAF-educated monocytes. As shown in Fig.\u00a04, CAF-educated monocytes markedly suppressed T-cell proliferation in effector-cell-to-target-cell-ratio (E:T) dependent manner; since a higher E:T seems to result in a more prominent immunosuppression (Fig.\u00a04B).CAF-educated monocytes enhance the motility of breast cancer cellsCAF-educated monocytes induce increased motility of MDA-MB-231 cells. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for 24\u2009hours. (A) Representative microscopic views of tumour cells that show invasion are shown (i: Standard Medium, ii: CM from Control Monocytes, iii: CM from CAF-educated Monocytes, iv: CM from NF-educated Monocytes, v: CM from MDA-MB-231-educated Monocytes). (B) Tumour cells that show invasion were counted and presented in bar graphs. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. standard medium. Arrows demonstrate counted tumour cells that show invasion.CAF-educated monocytes modify the expressions of EMT-related proteins and genes. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for 24\u2009hours. (A\u2013D) The effects of NF-, CAF- or MDA-MB-231-educated monocyte CMs on the EMT of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were analysed by Western blot analysis of vimentin and E-cadherin proteins. Densitometry shows relative protein expression normalized for GAPDH (n\u2009=\u20093). (E\u2013G) The effects of NF-, CAF- or MDA-MB-231-educated monocyte CMs on the EMT of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR of Snail, Slug and Twist gene expressions (n\u2009=\u20093). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. **p\u2009<\u20090.01. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001. ns: not significant.In order to investigate the effects of CAF-educated monocytes on the motility of breast cancer cells, we treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with CMs from CAF-, NF-, or MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes. The invasion of breast cancer cells was enhanced by the effects of CAF-educated monocytes (similar to MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes), whereas the invasion of breast cancer cells was not significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of control monocytes (Fig.\u00a05). In addition, we investigated the changes in expressions of EMT-related proteins of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes. For this reason, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with CMs from CAF-, NF-, or MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes. Vimentin expression was found to be increased and E-cadherin expression was found to be decreased in breast cancer cells by the effects of CAF-educated monocytes. On the contrary, neither vimentin nor E-cadherin expression was significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of control monocytes (Fig.\u00a06A\u2013D). Real-time qPCR results showed that CAF-educated monocytes induce breast cancer cell expressions of Snail, Slug and Twist genes; which are EMT-related genes, both compared with control monocytes and with NF-educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a06E\u2013G).CAFs re-direct differentiated M1 macrophages to M2-like macrophagesCAF and MDA-MB-231 cells induce M1 macrophages to differentiate into M2-like macrophages. (A) M1 macrophages were subsequently cultured with CMs from CAFs or MDA-MB-231 cells. After 48\u2009hours, cells were analysed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of CD163 and CD206 were significantly higher in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages than in M1 macrophages alone. Representative histograms of each molecule are shown. (B) Data are presented as relative fold changes to control IgG in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. (C) M1 macrophages were cultured alone or with CMs from CAFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells for 48\u2009hours and the levels of IL-12 or IL-10 were measured by ELISA. Levels of IL-12 was decreased in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages compared with that in M1 macrophages alone. In contrast, levels of IL-10 increased in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages compared with that in M1 macrophages alone. *p\u2009<\u20090.05.We then set out to explore whether CAFs were able to induce the differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. For this reason, we cultured M1 macrophages with CMs of CAFs as well as breast cancer cells. After 2 days, the expression of CD163 significantly increased in M1 macrophages treated with CMs of either CAFs or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; as a result, resembling the surface expression of M2 macrophages (Fig.\u00a07). Even though CD206 expressions of CAF- or breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages slightly increased, such increases were not found to be statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07B); whereas, CD206 expression of CAF-educated monocytes was shown to increase significantly (Fig.\u00a03B). In addition, we determined IL-10 and IL-12 cytokine levels in culture supernatants. IL-12 cytokine levels decreased in the supernatants of both CAF- and breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages. On the other hand, IL-10 cytokine levels seem to have slightly increased in the supernatants of both CAF- and breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages, although this increase was not found to be statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07C).High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in breast cancer tissue samplesCorrelation between the number of macrophages positive for CD163, and CD206 as well as \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts in breast tumour stroma with clinical and pathological features.\tNo. of cases\tCAF grade\u2021\tCD163+ macrophages*\tCD206+ macrophages*\t \tLow (n\u2009=\u200927)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200923)\tp value\u2020\tLow (n\u2009=\u200925)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200925)\tp value\u2020\tLow (n\u2009=\u200928)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200922)\tp value\u2020\t \tAge\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u226450\t27\t16\t11\t0.57\t16\t11\t0.25\t13\t14\t0.26\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>50\t23\t11\t12\t\t9\t14\t\t15\t8\t\t \tGrade\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\t8\t6\t2\t0.26\t7\t1\t0.04\t3\t5\t0.27\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\t42\t21\t21\t\t18\t24\t\t25\t17\t\t \tKi-67 index#\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u22645%\t4\t4\t0\t0.02\t4\t0\t0.03\t3\t1\t0.60\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>5%\t25\t8\t17\t\t9\t16\t\t13\t12\t\t \tLymph node involment\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Negative\t26\t13\t13\t0.58\t13\t13\t1.00\t16\t10\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Positive\t24\t14\t10\t\t12\t12\t\t12\t12\t\t \tTumor size\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u22642\u2009cm\t17\t13\t4\t0.03\t13\t4\t0.01\t9\t8\t0.77\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>2\u2009cm\t33\t14\t19\t\t12\t21\t\t19\t14\t\t \tMolecular subtypes\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ER/PR(+)\t16\t10\t6\t0.66\t9\t7\t0.09\t8\t8\t0.44\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HER2(+)\t11\t6\t5\t\t8\t3\t\t8\t3\t\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Triple negative\t23\t11\t12\t\t8\t15\t\t12\t11\t\t \t*The median values of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophage numbers in stroma within the areas were used to divide the patients into high and low grade groups.\u2021The grades of CAF area in stroma were used to divide the patients into two groups (low and high grade).#Ki-67 index was evaluated in 29 tissue samples.\u2020Data were analysed by Fisher\u2019s exact test and chi-squared test, and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.We analysed the presence of macrophages positive for CD163 and CD206 as well as \u03b1-SMA positive fibroblasts in 50 human breast cancer samples using immunohistochemistry. We divided the sample group into high and low grade groups based on the median number of CD163+ macrophages (64; range 18\u2212151), and CD206+ macrophages (15; range 2\u201350). We then analysed the associations of TAM grade with clinical and pathological features (Table\u00a01). High level of infiltration of stromal CD163+ macrophages was associated with higher histologic grade, higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. High CAF grade was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume (Table\u00a01).High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in breast cancer tissue samples. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD163, CD206, \u03b1-SMA, and Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) in breast cancer samples are shown. \u03b1-SMA (A), CD163 (B), CD206 (C), and H&E (D) were stained in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissue sample. \u03b1-SMA (E), CD163 (F), CD206 (G), and H&E (H) were stained in a HER2+ breast cancer tissue sample. \u03b1-SMA (I), CD163 (J), CD206 (K), and H&E (L) were stained in an ER+PR+ breast cancer tissue sample (\u00d7400; scale bar, 50\u2009\u00b5m).

Indeed, we found that high grade CAF tissues harboured higher numbers of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophages (Fig.\u00a08A\u2013D and Table\u00a02). In addition, low CAF grade was associated with lower numbers of CD163+or CD206+ macrophages (Fig.\u00a08I\u2013L, Table\u00a02).CAF-educated monocytes increased the proliferation of breast cancer cellsCAF-educated monocytes induce increased proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF or CAF cells. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. (A) Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were evaluated with MTT assay after 48\u2009hours of treatment with corresponding CMs and normalized cell numbers are shown (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, n\u2009=\u20093).

Normalized cell index (22:26:25, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) as a measure for cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells that were treated with NF- (blue) or CAF-educated (red) monocyte CMs is shown.

On the other hand, the proliferation of breast cancer cells was not significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a09A). Similar findings concerning the effects of NF- and CAF- educated monocytes on breast cancer cell proliferation were observed in real-time and label-free analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with the xCELLigence system (Fig.\u00a09B).DiscussionIt is now clear that there is a continual crosstalk not only between tumour cells and immune cells but also between stromal cells such as CAFs and immune cells. This crosstalk has an important role on development and progression of tumours. CAFs have recently been implicated in regulation of immune cell recruitment and function. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of cancer associated fibroblasts, compared with normal fibroblasts and breast cancer cells, on monocyte recruitment and polarization in breast cancer.The perspective concerning adult tissue macrophages being solely derived from bone marrow precursor cells have been recently abandoned. In fact, it has been shown that most tissue resident macrophages originated from yolk sac precursor cells. On the other hand, macrophages found in pathogen associated inflammation mostly originate from bone marrow monocytes. It has recently been show that most TAM sub-populations emerge from the Ly6C+ population of circulating mouse monocytes in grafted tumours, primary mouse mammary tumours and in lung metastases. Therefore, investigating the factors associated with monocyte recruitment to tumour tissues has utmost importance. Previous studies have shown that CAFs secrete large amounts of SDF-1. We found that CAF derived SDF-1 was crucial for monocyte recruitment, which underlines the key importance of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis for progression of several cancers. Previous studies have also shown that MCP-1 was able to induce infiltration of blood monocytes into CAF spheroids and to recruit monocytes into mammary tumours. Even though CAF-induced monocyte migration decreased with MCP-1 inhibition in our study, this decrease was not as prominent as that seen with SDF-1 inhibition. This finding demonstrated that SDF-1 is more significant in CAF-induced monocyte chemotaxis than MCP-1.Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that is upregulated on activated T cells for the induction of immune tolerance. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have been shown to be effective against several types of cancer. In a very recent study, Gordon et al. have shown that PD-1 is also expressed by both mouse and human TAMs in addition to activated T cells. They also characterized PD-1+ TAMs and showed that almost all PD-1+ TAMs express an M2-like surface profile. In light of this important study, we investigated whether CAFs might have a role in inducing such immunosuppressive PD-1+ TAMs. The role of CAFs in the induction of PD-1 expression on TAMs have not been investigated before. We found that CAF-educated monocytes demonstrated high PD-1 expression as well as CD163 and CD206 expressions. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that CAFs are able to induce a PD-1+ TAM phenotype by themselves, even without the presence of tumour cells. In addition, our findings prove that CAFs are as potent as tumour cells in terms of inducing such PD-1 expressions (Fig.\u00a03). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that PD-1+ TAMs are relevant for breast cancer in addition to colorectal cancer. In line with these findings, we suggest that CAFs may recruit monocytes and induce these recruited monocytes to differentiate into PD-1 expressing M2-like macrophages, instead of M1 macrophages. Therefore, PD-1 axis might be crucial in CAF induced immune suppression in vivo in several types of cancer including breast and colorectal tumours.In the current study, we also showed that CAF-educated monocytes exhibited increased expression of CD206 and CD163. Immune functions of CD206 (C-Type Mannose Receptor 1) has not yet been fully understood. It has been shown that the lack of CD206 results in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production during endotoxemic lung inflammation in mice and increased serum levels of inflammatory proteins, suggesting that it may have a role in the resolution of inflammation by decreasing inflammatory molecules in the blood. CAF mediated induction of higher expression of CD206, which has anti-inflammatory effects, on monocytes may also demonstrate another indirect mechanism of immune suppression by CAFs. CD163 is a haptoglobin-hemoglobin scavenger receptor and it correlates with known prognostic factors (e.g. poor differentiation (Grade 3), ER negativity and ductal type which are associated with bad prognosis). As one would expect, CAFs induced a very high CD163 expression on monocytes compared with NFs (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, we found that breast cancer cells induced high CD163 and CD206 expressions on monocytes as well as MHC class II (HLA-DR) expression; whereas CAFs did not induce HLA-DR expression on monocytes. HLA-DR is well known to be associated with M1 macrophages. The induction of HLA-DR expression on monocytes by breast cancer cells may seem controversial; however, the study by Edin et al. has shown that colorectal cancer cells induce TAMs of a \u201cmixed\u201d M1/M2 phenotype, which in turn could contribute to a \u201cgood inflammatory response\u201d. Moreover, Helm et al. have demonstrated that HLA-DR and CD163 double positive cells were detectable by immunohistochemical stainings in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues. We propose that CAF-mediated down regulation of MHC class II expression on monocytes may demonstrate a mechanism of immune escape via decreased antigen presentation, in addition to confirming the notion that CAFs are not implicated in any types of \u201cgood inflammatory response\u201d. On the other hand, it should also be noted that NF-educated monocytes expressed both CD14 and HLA-DR, which are associated with M1 macrophages, more than CAF-educated monocytes. This finding shows that activated tumour stroma may have explicit functions in terms of macrophage polarization. In line with our findings, Zhang et al. demonstrated that the number of CD68+CD163+ macrophages was higher in breast cancer tissues than in normal breast tissues.Several studies showed that TAMs promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis by releasing a variety of cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrated that CAF-educated monocytes increased breast cancer cell invasion as well as the expressions of EMT-related genes and vimentin protein significantly, while decreasing E-cadherin protein expression; in contrast to NF-educated monocytes. Our in vitro migration assay findings and gene/protein expression results display that CAF-educated monocytes enhance the motility of breast cancer cells. In a very recent study by Linde et al., CD206+ macrophages were shown to downregulate E-cadherin junctions in breast cancer cells, which may facilitate EMT. Thus, our findings support the notion that CAFs promote EMT, invasion and metastasis; via inducing M2 macrophages. We then investigated whether CAF-educated monocytes have immunosuppressive features. CAF-educated monocytes significantly suppressed T cell proliferation in contrast to control or NF-educated monocytes. CAFs were known to directly inhibit proliferation of T lymphocytes. In the current study, we showed that CAFs also exert immunosuppressive effects, indirectly, by differentiating the monocytes into M2-like TAMs.Activation status of M1/M2 macrophages in tumour tissues is transient, which gives them a functional plasticity. Our results suggest that CAFs may re-direct M1 macrophages to M2-like macrophages in the tumour tissue. The differentiation of macrophages from anti-tumoural M1-like to pro-tumoural M2-like macrophages is a crucial event in the establishment of the tumour microenvironment. Thus, investigating the factors that drive the trans-differentiation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in tumour tissues has great importance in terms of targeted therapies. We observed that CAF-educated M1 macrophages showed increased secretion of IL-10 and decreased secretion of IL-12 in addition to phenotypic changes (i.e. increased expression of M2 markers). Even though our results demonstrated that CAF-educated M1 macrophages seem to display increased expressions of both CD163 and CD206, the increase in the expression of CD206 did not reach statistical significance (Fig.\u00a07B). Given our results showing that CAF-educated monocytes show significantly increased expressions of both CD163 and CD206 (Fig.\u00a03B), CD206 expression change of CAF-educated M1 macrophages seems interesting. In fact, our studies with human breast cancer tissue samples also demonstrated that higher number of CAFs is correlated with higher numbers of not only CD163+ but also CD206+ macrophages (Table\u00a02). CD206 was reported to be more associated with M2a-like macrophages, while CD163 is prominent on the surface of M2c-like macrophages. In addition, Mantovani et al. reported that M2a macrophages are associated with TH2 type immune responses and elimination of parasites, while M2c macrophages are more implicated in immunoregulation and tissue remodelling. Therefore, CAFs may be inclined to polarize the M1 macrophages more into the M2c phenotype that is associated with immune suppression than M2a. Such a predilection seems reasonable considering tumours are known as wounds that do not heal and thus require a chronic wound healing/tissue remodelling process instead of an allergic response or killing of parasites. This might explain our results about CAF-educated M1 macrophages and our findings suggest that CAFs may be influencing M1/M2 trans-differentiation. It has been shown that IL-4, which is secreted from tumour cells and T lymphocytes, as well as colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which are secreted from tumour cells, take part in pro-tumoural differentiation of macrophages. In line with these studies, we suggest that CAFs may also prove to be important players in this re-polarization process.Since the number of \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts was found to be significantly higher in the tumour stroma compared with that in benign breast tissue and the number of TAMs was higher in tumour stroma than in tumour nest, we analysed the tumour stroma to evaluate both of these cells rather than the tumour nest. We found that the number of CD163+ TAMs significantly correlated with high tumour grade, high Ki-67 proliferation index and high tumour size. In line with such findings, CAF-educated monocytes were found to increase breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro (Fig.\u00a09). The infiltration of CD163+ TAMs seemed to be the highest in triple negative, and the lowest in ER+PR+ breast cancer samples (Fig.\u00a08), although such findings were not statistically significant.The copresence of CAFs and TAMs inside a tumour was considered to be a potential prognostic feature in colorectal cancer patients. In the current study, we showed that there exists a significant correlation between the number of TAMs and the CAF grade in breast cancer. It was recently reported that CAF-derived Chitinase 3-like 1, which is implicated in inflammatory disorders, contributed to tumour growth in breast cancer and this contribution is accompanied by a high infiltration of M2-polarized macrophages and TH2 type immune responses. Therefore, our finding of increased infiltration of breast tumour tissues with TAMs might be a direct result of the presence of high number of CAFs in those tumours; since we also demonstrated that CAFs recruit monocytes and induce M2 type polarization.In this study, we examined the relationship between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and monocytes/macrophages in breast cancer using human ex vivo cellular systems and tissues samples obtained from breast cancer patients as well as in vitro cell lines. Even though our studies were not performed using in vivo systems, our results demonstrate that CAFs promote monocyte migration and enhance their differentiation to M2-like macrophages; based on phenotype, cytokine and functional features. In addition, our studies with human breast cancer patient tissue microarrays (TMAs) showed some translational promise. Future in vivo experiments will shed further light on such new mechanistic insights and provide broader implications, as such systems would simulate all the elements of the tumour microenvironment, as well as demonstrating the effects of cell-to-cell contact in addition to the cross-talk mediated via soluble factors demonstrated in our study. Accordingly, in vivo experiments in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice can be used to prove that human monocytes co-injected s.c. with tumour cells acquire a stronger protumoural effect if preconditioned with CAFs in contrast to NFs.Materials and MethodsIsolation of fibroblasts from normal and cancerous breast tissueNormal breast tissues were obtained from 3 patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty and breast cancer tissues were obtained from 4 patients undergoing therapeutic mastectomy. All fibroblasts were isolated using a previously described protocol that utilizes Collagenase I (1\u2009mg/mL) and Hyaluronidase (125 U/mL) enzymes followed by differential sedimentation and plating. Enzymatically digested tissues were then cultured in high serum media conditions which select for fibroblast growth (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium [DMEM] supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum at 37\u2009C, 5% CO2). All human breast tissues for all of the experiments were obtained in accordance with the laws and institutional guidelines, as approved by the institutional review board of Hacettepe University (Approval numbers: GO 16/64 - 20 and GO 17/380 - 31). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.Characterization of fibroblasts with immunocytochemistryCharacterizations of fibroblasts were performed by immunocytochemistry stainings with vimentin, pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-SMA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells (7\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/300\u2009\u00b5L in each well) were cultured in eight well chamber slides and immunocytochemical / morphological analyses were performed when the cells reached a surface confluency of >80%. A biotin/streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase detection system was utilized and binding of the antibody was demonstrated with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. The images were captured by Olympus BX50 microscope.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM)CMs were obtained from CAFs, NFs and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. When the aforementioned cells reached to a confluency of >80%, they were serum starved. After 48\u2009h, CMs were collected from cell supernatants and clarified by centrifugation.Isolation and culture of peripheral CD14+ monocytesPBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers\u2019 peripheral blood using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077. Separation of CD14+ monocytes from PBMCs was accomplished by using a magnetic bead based positive selection protocol with a purity of >95%. CD14+ monocytes were cultured alone as control monocytes or with CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (CM:RPMI, 1:1) for 7-days.Phenotypical analyses with flow cytometryCD14+ PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured with CMs from NFs, CAFs, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as well as in standard medium for 7 days, then analysed using flow cytometry. M1 macrophages were cultured with CMs from CAFs or MDA-MB-231 cells for 48\u2009hours, then analysed by flow cytometry.Cultured monocytes or macrophages were detached using Accutase cell detachment solution, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were stained with antibodies against CD206, CD163, HLA-DR, CD14, and PD-1. All antibodies were conjugated to Phycoerythrin (PE) or Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Respective isotype-matched antibody controls were used as negative controls.Isolation of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cellsPBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers\u2019 peripheral blood using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077. Separation of CD4+ T-cells from PBMCs was accomplished by using a magnetic bead based negative selection protocol with a purity of >95%. CD4+ T-cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 2.1 mM L-glutamine, 100\u2009U/mL penicillin and 100\u2009mg/mL streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2.CFSE proliferation assaysIn order to assess the effects of CAF-, NF- and MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes on CD4+ T lymphocytes, we performed functional analyses with flow cytometry. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelled CD4+ T-cells were activated by CD3/CD28 magnetic beads (except the negative control group). Activated T-cells were cultured with either control monocytes or with monocytes that had been cultured with CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 cells for 7 days. After 96\u2009hours, proliferation of CFSE labelled CD4+ T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry.Evaluation of cell migrationIn order to evaluate the effects of CAFs, NFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells on monocyte recruitment, we performed in vitro migration assays. Monocyte cells were seeded into the upper compartment in serum-free medium (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 200\u2009\u00b5l). The 5\u2009\u00b5m Transwell chambers were placed into 24-well culture wells containing CMs from CAFs, NFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells. After 5\u2009h incubation, non-migrated cells were removed by cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted in five different fields of polycarbonate filter under a microscope (magnification x100).Evaluation of EMT-related protein expressions by Western BlotMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured for 24\u2009hours prior to CM treatments. The cells were then treated with CMs from NF-, CAF-, MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes or from control monocytes for 48\u2009hours. At the end of this period, cells were lysed in RIPA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). E-cadherin (primary antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; #3195) and vimentin (primary antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 5741) protein expressions in samples were examined by the Western blot method. GAPDH (primay antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, #5174) was used as the Western blot loading control. The membranes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL) and densitometry analyses of the protein bands were performed.Evaluation of EMT-related gene expressions by quantitative real-time PCRMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured for 24\u2009hours prior to CM treatments. The cells were then treated with CMs from NF-, CAF-, MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes or from control monocytes for 48\u2009hours. At the end of this period, RNA isolation from the cells was performed according to the Zymo Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit protocol. Complementary DNA was synthesized with Thermo Scientific RevertAid First Strand cDNA Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time qPCR was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The qPCR data were analysed using the Livak model (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct). Snail (Snail_reverse 5\u2032-CTGCTGGAAGGTAAACTCTGGA-3\u2032, Snail_forward 5\u2032-CGAGTGGTTCTTCTGCGCTA-3\u2032), Slug (Slug_reverse 5\u2032-TTCTCCCCCGTGTGAGTTCTAA-3\u2032, Slug_forward 5\u2032-CACTGCGATGCCCAGTCTA-3\u2032), and Twist (Twist_reverse 5\u2032-CCCACGCCCTGTTTCTTTGA-3\u2032, Twist_forward 5\u2032-GCCGGAGACCTAGATGTCATT-3\u2032) gene expressions were evaluated. \u03b2 -actin was used as the reference gene.Evaluation of cell invasionMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion was evaluated by using Transwell inserts in vitro. Monocytes were differentiated for 7 days using CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009h and corresponding supernatants were then collected. MDA-MB-231 cells in serum-free medium were seeded into upper compartments of Transwell inserts which were pre-coated with Matrigel (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 200\u2009\u00b5l). The lower compartment contained the aforementioned supernatants, which were obtained from monocytes. After 24\u2009hours, non-migrated cells were removed by cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted in five different fields of polycarbonate filter under a microscope (magnification x200).Induction of M1/M2 polarization of macrophagesCD14+ monocytes were cultured in medium containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (50\u2009ng/ml) for 7 days to obtain M0 macrophages. In order to acquire M1 macrophages, M0 macrophages were further cultured in medium containing interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) (100\u2009ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (10\u2009ng/ml) for 2 more days. On the other hand, M0 macrophages were further cultured in medium containing IL-4 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 2 more days in order to obtain M2 macrophages.Assessment of soluble factors by ELISAIn order to evaluate the levels of IL-12 and IL-10 cytokines in the culture supernatants of M1 and M2 macrophages, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We cultured M1 or M2 macrophages alone (as negative control) or with CMs from CAFs, or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells for 2 days. After this period, the cells were further cultured for additional 2 days in serum-free medium. Culture supernatants were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until the assays were performed.Measurement of cell proliferation by MTT assayMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation was evaluated via MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After about a day of incubation, CMs obtained from CAF- or NF-educated-monocytes were added to the wells and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferations were analysed after an additional 48\u2009hours (72\u2009hours in total) by adding 25\u2009\u03bcl MTT reagent (final concentration: 1\u2009mg/ml) in each well. 4\u2009hours after adding the MTT reagent, the precipitate was solubilized by 80\u2009\u03bcl detergent reagent. The plates were then left overnight in the dark and the absorbances were recorded at 570\u2009nm.Real-time and label-free analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with the xCELLigence systemIn order to assess the real-time effects of CAF- and NF-educated monocytes on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation, we performed functional analyses with the RTCA xCELLigence System (ACEA, San Diego, CA, USA). This system utilizes gold biosensor microelectrodes to measure electrical impedance. The background impedance of the microelectrodes were first measured with cell culture medium. Then, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were added to each well of the E-plate. After about a day of incubation, CMs obtained from CAF- or NF-educated-monocytes were added to the wells and the cell indices were measured by electrical impedance over an additional period of 48\u2009hours (72\u2009hours in total).Tissue samples and immunohistochemical stainingsA total of 50 human invasive breast cancer tissue samples were investigated. Patients who had received preoperative/adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. Clinical and pathological variables including age, tumour grade and size, lymph node involvement, Ki-67 staining as well as ER, PR and HER2 status were evaluated.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples were used for tissue microarrays (TMAs). Blocks were made utilizing a 4.0\u2009mm tissue cylinder through a histologically representative area of each donor tumour block. From each donor block, 1\u20132 cores were cut and 8 TMA blocks were prepared. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD163 (Biocare, Clone 10D6, 10\u2009min EDTA, 1:100), CD206 (Abcam, ab64693, 20\u2009min EDTA, 1:200) and \u03b1-SMA (Neomarkers, Clone 1A4, 1:1000) as well as Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) were performed on the 4-\u03bcm thick sections taken from the tissue microarrays using Leica Bond Max III Autostainer, following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Concentrations and antigen retrieval methods were optimized for each antibody using appropriate positive and negative controls.TAM and CAF grade evaluationsAll tissue microarray slides stained with anti-CD163 or anti-CD206 were analysed to identify areas with the highest levels of TAM infiltration. For each case, three hot spots in the tumour stroma (40x objective) were selected for counting TAMs. The median values of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophage numbers in stroma within the areas were used to categorize the patients into high and low grade groups. The intensity of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA positive spindle-shaped fibroblasts) was classified into 2 grades, using a modification of a method previously described: negative to scanty (low grade) or abundant (high grade) in a blinded analysis performed by 2 of the authors (K.K., and B.G.Y.).Statistical analysesThe Mann-Whitney U test, Student\u2019s t-test, chi-squared test, and Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to examine differences in continuous and categorical variables. A 5% type-I error level was used to infer statistical significance. All statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Software version 23.ConclusionsOur results propose that CAFs recruit monocytes and induce TAMs which might be suppressing the immune system via the PD-1 axis. We herein demonstrated that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration in order to increase the effectiveness of conventional therapies as well as immunotherapies against breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Betul Gok Yavuz and Gurcan Gunaydin contributed equally.Electronic supplementary materialSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1038/s41598-019-39553-z.Author ContributionsB.G.Y., G.G., M.E.G. and K.K. performed the experiments.

        "content": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a critically important mediator of inflammation that significantly influences tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. We investigated the role of COX-2 expressed by triple negative breast cancer cells in altering the structure and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 downregulation effects on ECM structure and function were investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy of tumors derived from triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and a derived clone stably expressing a short hairpin (shRNA) molecule downregulating COX-2. MRI of albumin-GdDTPA was used to characterize macromolecular fluid transport in vivo and SHG microscopy was used to quantify collagen 1 (Col1) fiber morphology. COX-2 downregulation decreased Col1 fiber density and altered macromolecular fluid transport. Immunohistochemistry identified significantly fewer activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in low COX-2 expressing tumors.

We investigated the role of COX-2 expressed by triple negative breast cancer cells in altering the structure and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 downregulation effects on ECM structure and function were investigated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy of tumors derived from triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and a derived clone stably expressing a short hairpin (shRNA) molecule downregulating COX-2. MRI of albumin-GdDTPA was used to characterize macromolecular fluid transport in vivo and SHG microscopy was used to quantify collagen 1 (Col1) fiber morphology. COX-2 downregulation decreased Col1 fiber density and altered macromolecular fluid transport. Immunohistochemistry identified significantly fewer activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in low COX-2 expressing tumors. Metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells were infrequent, smaller, and contained fewer Col1 fibers.COX-2 overexpression studies were performed with tumors derived from triple negative SUM-149 breast cancer cells lentivirally transduced to overexpress COX-2.

Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

Here, we characterize four CAF subsets in breast cancer with distinct properties and levels of activation. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF-S1, CAF-S4) accumulate differentially in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC).

Finally, in contrast to CAF-S4, CAF-S1 enhances the regulatory T\u00a0cell capacity to inhibit T effector proliferation.

Clinically, BC has different histological forms, which may lead to different treatment regimens and prognosis. Although early diagnosis and treatment strategies, such as endocrine agents, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and biological targeting agents, have been improved in recent decades, the prognosis of BC remains poor, especially of patients with recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, establishing molecular biomarkers that can detect early metastasis of BC is necessary for BC patients.It has been shown that the interaction between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer. The interactions between cancer cells and tumor microenvironment are mediated through direct or indirect mechanisms, which involve in deposited substances, stromal cells, or secretion of proteins. The activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to be the most enriched cells in tumor stroma and promote tumor growth and metastasis by secreting a variety of soluble factors, directly interacting with tumor cells, regulating immune-response, and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Studies comparing co-culture of BC cells with or without fibroblasts showed increased proliferation, anti-apoptosis, metastasis, metabolism, and chemoresistance when they were co-cultured. Interestingly, not only CAFs within tumor but also CAFs immediately adjacent to tumor promoted cancer progression.Chemokines are a family of cytokines or signaling proteins exerting their biological effects by interacting with G-protein-coupled receptors, initiating an intracellular signal cascade that facilitates migration to chemokine source. There are increasing evidences that chemokines and chemokine receptors directly affect the survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and metastasis of many cancer cells, including BC cells, which express chemokine receptors and respond to specific chemokines. C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is an important chemokine receptor for BC progression that is expressed in BC and correlated with a poor survival outcome of BC patients. The ability of CAFs to influence tumor growth was partly dependent on their ability to induce angiogenesis by CAF derived C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), a ligand of CCR4. C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) is another ligand of CCR4 that is highly expressed by thymus and other cells such as fibroblasts, and CCL17/CCR4 signaling promotes lung metastasis of BC. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the CCL17/CCR4 signaling mediated by CAFs in BC progression remain elusive.The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, including the well-known mediator extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), regulates matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) expression. MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that play a role in cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, tissue repair, and immune-response and affect bioactive molecules on the cell surface, suggesting that they play important roles inside and outside of ECM degradation. MMP13 is known to promote BC cell invasion and metastasis and is associated with overall survival of BC patients. ERK1/2, as well as its downstream signaling effector MMP13, is some of the mechanism by which CXCL12/CXCR4 or CCL17/CCR4 regulates cell invasion and migration of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and bladder cancer. However, how CCL17 regulates ERK1/2 pathway directly or indirectly remains unclear. MAP kinase phosphatase enzymes (MKPs) belong to the family of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), inactivating different MAPK proteins, including ERK1/2. Among these, DUSP6 displays a high specificity for ERK1/2 and has been found to regulate BC cell migration and invasion.Hence, the correlation of clinicopathological characteristics with CCL17 expression, the functional effect of CAFs on BC progression, and the potential mechanisms by which CCL17 promotes tumor were clarified. In the present study, we found that CCL17 expression is increased in BC tissues and CAFs and associates with lymph nodes, TNM stage, and tumor size of BC patients. CCL17 produced by CAFs promotes migration and invasion of BC cells through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Therefore, our findings emphasize an important role for CCL17 in controlling BC development, which is helpful to identify potential therapeutic targets for its treatment.Materials and methodsTissue samples and isolation of primary fibroblastsHuman BC tissues and the corresponding adjacent-normal breast tissues as well as peripheral blood samples were obtained from 140 BC patients who underwent surgery at Sichuan Cancer Hospital between 2016 and 2018. These adjacent-normal breast tissues were resected within at least 5 cm of the tumor margin when the patients underwent definitive surgery. The healthy control groups included 140 healthy women who underwent mammary gland examination prior to peripheral blood sample collection. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described previously. Briefly, tumor and adjacent-normal tissues were digested with 2% collagenase II (1 mg/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 30 mins at 37\u00b0C, then cultured in DMEM containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37\u00b0C in an incubator, and the fibroblasts derived from tumor and adjacent-normal tissues were defined as CAFs and NFs, respectively. The medium was changed every 2 days. In the present study, low-passage-number primary fibroblasts (<4) were used and characterized by strong immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and negative immunohistochemical staining for CK19 (Figure S1), using anti-CK19 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; ab52625) or anti-vimentin antibody (Abcam; ab8978).Ethical approvalAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration. This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan Cancer Hospital. Written informed consents were provided prior to enrollment of patients.Cell cultureHuman BC cell lines MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation, Rochester, MI, USA) and MDA-MB-231 (EG&G Mason Research Institute, Worcester, MA, USA) were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified air atmosphere in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin mixture (Solarbio).Transfection and lentivirus infectionThe RNAi (RNA interference) sequences targeting position 227\u2013245 (shRNA-1; 5\u02b9-GCTGCCTGGAGTACTTCAA-3\u02b9), position 366\u2013384 (shRNA-2; 5\u02b9-GCTGCCTGGAGTACTTCAA-3\u02b9) or position 379\u2013397 (shRNA-3; 5\u02b9-GCAGTTAAATACCTGCAAA-3\u02b9) of the human CCL17 gene were cloned into the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA). For lentiviral production, HEK-293T cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of the lentiviral vectors for 4 hrs. After incubation for 48 hrs, viral particles in cell culture medium were collected and infected CAFs. CCL17 or DUSP6 overexpression was constructed by cloning full-length human CCL17 or DUSP6 into the pLVX-Puro lentiviral expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and then transfected into 293T cells as above described and used to infect NFs or MCF-7 cells. Cells transduced with pLKO.1-scramble shRNA (shNC) or blank pLVX-Puro (Vector) were used as negative controls.Cafs/nfs and MCF-7/MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultureCAFs with pLKO.1-CCL17-shRNA or shNC infection and NFs with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank vector infection were digested with trypsin and resuspended in DMEM with the cell density of 5\u00d7104/mL. 0.1 mL cell suspension (5\u00d7103 cells per well) in each group was added into the upper well of the transwell inserts containing polycarbonate filters with 3-\u03bcm pores (Corning, Madrid, Spain). The lower chamber was inoculated with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells at a density of 5\u00d7103 cells per well and cultured in the incubator of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. After co-culture for 48 hrs, the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were collected for the following experiments.Cell proliferationCells (3\u00d7103/well) were seeded into 96-well plate and maintained overnight prior to conduction of experiments. After 12, 24, and 48 hrs, cells were incubated with 10% Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) solution (SAB Biotech., College Park, MD, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Optical density at wavelength 450 nm (OD450) was determined using a microplate reader.Transwell assayCells (3\u00d7105/well) were seeded onto 24-well plates and maintained overnight prior to conduction of experiments. After treatment, cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs, following which 3\u00d7105 cells/well in 300 \u03bcL serum-free DMEM were placed in the upper chamber at 37\u00b0C. The DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (700 \u03bcL) was added into the lower chamber. After 24 hrs incubation, the cell invasion and migration were determined in Transwell inserts (Millipore) containing polycarbonate filters with 8 \u03bcm pores coated with or without Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) as detailed previously.RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCRRNA was extracted from BC cell lines or tissues using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and reverse transcription reaction on RNA was carried out using PrimeScript reagent kit (Takara Biomedical Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Real-time Quantitative PCR for CCL17, CCR4, and DUSP6 was performed using an ABI Prism 7,500 sequence detection PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Shanghai, China). The primer sequences were shown subsequently: CCL17 (Homo sapiens), 5\u02b9-GTCTTGAAGCCTCCTCAC-3\u02b9 (forward), 5\u02b9-CATGGCTCCAGTTCAGAC-3\u02b9 (reverse); CCR4 (Homo sapiens), 5\u02b9-CCTTCCTGGCTTTCTGTTC-3\u02b9 (forward), 5\u02b9-CATCTTCACCGCCTTGTTC-3\u02b9 (reverse); GAPDH (Homo sapiens), 5\u02b9-AATCCCATCACCATCTTC-3\u02b9 (forward), 5\u02b9-AGGCTGTTGTCATACTTC-3\u02b9 (reverse). Gene expression was determined by normalizing to GAPDH and calculating by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)CCL17 content in peripheral blood or fibroblast supernatants was measured by Human TARC ELISA Kit (CCL17) (Abcam; ab183366) and MMP13 content in BC cell supernatants was measured by MMP13 Human ELISA Kit (Abcam; ab100605), following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction.Western blotWestern blotting was conducted as previously described. Proteins were analyzed with the following antibodies: anti-CCL17 (Abcam; ab182793; 1:300), anti-CCR4 (Abcam; ab83250; 1:1,000, anti-DUSP6 (Abcam; ab181088; 1:1,000), anti-MMP13 (Abcam; ab84594; 1:1,000), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 9102; 1:1000), anti-p-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology; 9,101; 1:1,000), anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology; 5,174; 1:2,000) and the secondary antibodies (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China; A0208; 1:1000).Statistical analysesAll experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times. The results represent the mean \u00b1 SD where applicable. The numerical data were statistically analyzed with GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA). Differences between the groups were determined with one-way ANOVA analyses followed by Dunnett\u2019s test, two-way ANOVA analyses followed by Tukey post-test or Student\u2019s t-test when only two groups were compared. Correlations between CCL17 and DUSP6 expression levels in BC tissues were assessed by Pearson correlation. Values of P<0.05 were considered to be of statistical significance.ResultsCCL17 expression is up-regulated and correlates with tumor progression in BC patientsCCL17 expression was increased in BC patients.

CCL17 expression was increased in tumor BC tissues compared with corresponding adjacent-normal tissues as well as in peripheral blood from BC patients compared with healthy controls (Figure 1A and B). Moreover, CAFs in the microenvironment are essential for tumor progression in BC. To know the role of CCL17 in CAFs, CCL17 expression is also measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1C and D, CCL17 expression was also increased in CAFs compared with NFs.Correlation of CCL17 expression with clinicopathological features of BCClinicopathological parameter\tCCL17 expression\tP-value\t \tHigh (n=98)\tLow (n=42)\t \tAge (years)\u2003<57\u2003\u226557\t5543\t2814\t0.2445\t \tTumor size (cm)\u2003<3\u2003\u22653\t5147\t3012\t0.0333\t \tTNM stage\u2003I/II\u2003III/IV\t6137\t348\t0.0299\t \tLymph nodes\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t6236\t1329\t0.0004\t \tHistologic grade\u2003I\u2003II\u2003III\t293138\t111219\t0.7158\t \tHistological type\u2003Ductal\u2003Non-ductal\t5840\t1824\t0.0756\t \tER status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t4850\t2220\t0.7122\t \tPR status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t5543\t2913\t0.1526\t \tHER2 status\u2003Positive\u2003Negative\t5741\t2715\t0.4980\t \tNote: Differences between groups were done by the Chi-square test.Abbreviations: BC, breast cancer; ER, estrogen receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor type 2. To further analyze the correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and CCL17 expression, the 140 BC patients were divided into two groups according to the mRNA level of CCL17 measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR comprising a CCL17 high expression group with fold change >1.5 (n=98, 70%) and CCL17 low expression group with fold change <1.5 (n=42, 30%) (Table 1). The age, histologic grade, histological type, ER status, PR status, and HER2 status of the patients were not significantly associated with the expression of CCL17. A statistically significant association of CCL17 was observed with tumor size, TNM stage, and lymph nodes. These data suggest that high CCL17 expression is closely correlated with tumor progression in BC patients. CCL17 regulates CCR4 expression and the proliferation of fibroblastsCCL17 expression regulated the proliferation of fibroblasts. CAFs were transduced with pLKO.1-CCL17 shRNA or shNC, and NFs were transduced with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank pLVX-Puro (vector). (A, C) CCL17 content was measured by ELISA; (B, D) CCR4 expression was measured by Western blot; and (E, F) cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; NFs, normal fibroblasts; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To investigate the pivotal role of CCL17/CCR4 signaling in fibroblasts, CCL17 was knockdown and overexpression in CAFs and NFs, respectively, and CCL17 and CCR4 expression level in cell lysate and cell supernatant was measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR, Western blot and ELISA analysis. As shown in Figure S2A and B, CCL17 shRNA-1, shRNA-2, and shRNA-3 significantly decreased the mRNA levels of CCL17 by 74.6%, 81.6%, and 65.6% and the protein levels of CCL17 by 75.3%, 70.7%, and 66.4% in CAFs compared with shNC, respectively. CCL17 overexpression significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of CCL17 by 4.3-fold and 3.9-fold in NFs compared with blank vector, respectively (Figure S2C and D). Meanwhile, CCL17 shRNA-1 and shRNA-2 also significantly decreased the CCL17 release and CCR4 expression in CAFs (Figure 2A and B), while CCL17 overexpression markedly increased the CCL17 release and CCR4 expression in NFs (Figure 2C and D). Moreover, our data showed that CCL17 knockdown markedly decreased the cell proliferation of CAFs by approximately 17% at 48 hrs, while CCL17 overexpression markedly increased the cell proliferation of NFs by 15.6% at 48 hrs (Figure 2E and F). These data suggest that CCL17/CCR4 signaling involves in the proliferation of fibroblasts.CCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibits BC cell invasion and migrationCCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibited BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs. (A, B) Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8, and (C\u2013E) invasion and migration were measured by Transwell assay. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer. To explore the important role of CAFs in invasion and migration of BC cells, MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CAFs with CCL17 knockdown, and the CCK-8 and Transwell assay were performed. As shown in Figure 3A and B, CAFs could increase the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells by 19.8% and 21.7% at 48 hrs, which were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs. Moreover, CAFs also increased the migration and invasion of MCF-7 by 2.04-fold and 2.0-fold and that of MDA-MB-231 cells by 2.78-fold and 3.02-fold, which were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs (Figure 3C\u2013E).CCL17 knockdown in CAFs inhibited CCL17, CCR4, MMP13, and p-ERK1/2 but promoted DUSP6 expression in BC cell lines. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, and the expression of (A, B) CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, (A, C) p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting. MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, and the expression of (E, F) CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, (E, G) p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 knockdown-induced CAFs. (D, H) The MMP13 concentration was measured by ELISA. *P<0.05, \u00a0**P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer.To further determine the importance of CCL17/CCR4 signaling in BC cell invasion and migration, the expression of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, DUSP6, and MMP13 was measured by Western blotting. We found that CAFs not only induced the expression of CCL17 and CCR4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, but also increased the expression of MMP13 and p-ERK1/2 and decreased the DUSP6 expression. However, these CAFs-mediated protein expressions were significantly inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs (Figure 4A\u2013H). These data suggested that CAFs with CCL17 knockdown suppressed BC cell migration and invasion.CCL17 overexpression in NFs promotes BC cell invasion and migrationCCL17 overexpression in NFs promotes BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MCF-7 cells were co-cultured with CCL17 overexpression-induced NFs. (A) Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8; (B, C) migration and invasion were measured by Transwell; (D\u2013F) expression of CCL17, CCR4, DUSP6, MMP13, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Western blotting; and (G) MMP13 concentration was measured by ELISA. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.Abbreviations: NFs, normal fibroblasts; BC, breast cancer; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We further examined the effect of NFs with CCL17 overexpression on BC cell migration and invasion. We found that co-culture with NFs increased MCF-7 cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and the expression of CCL17, CCR4, MMP13, and p-ERK1/2 and decreased the DUSP6 expression, which was significantly enhanced by CCL17 overexpression in NFs (Figure 5A\u2013G).DUSP6 overexpression inhibited BC cell invasion and migrationDUSP6 overexpression inhibited BC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. (A\u2013C) MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of recombinant CCL17 protein (rCCL17; 50, 100, and 200 ng/mL), and the expression of CCR4 and DUSP6 was measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR and Western blot. MCF-7 cells were transduced with pLVX-Puro-CCL17 or blank pLVX-Puro (vector) in the presence or absence of recombinant CCL17 (100 ng/mL). (D, E) Cell migration and invasion were measured by Transwell; (F) expression of MMP13, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 was measured by Transwell, Western blot; and (G) MMP13 concentration was measured by ELISA. ***P<0.001.Abbreviation: ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.To further examine the function of CCL17 in BC cell invasion and migration, MCF-7 cells were treated with different concentrations of recombinant CCL17 protein (50, 100, and 200 ng/mL), and the expression of CCR4 and DUSP6 was measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR and Western blot. It was found that recombinant CCL17 protein significantly increased the CCR4 expression and decreased the DUSP6 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A\u2013C). These results suggest that DUSP6 may involve in CCL17-mediated BC progression. To confirm our hypothesis, MCF-7 cells with DUSP6 overexpression were treated with recombinant CCL17 protein (100 ng/mL), and the cell invasion, migration, and the expression of p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and MMP13 were measured. The results showed that DUSP6 overexpression inhibited recombinant CCL17 protein-induced cell migration, invasion, and the expression of MMP13 and p-ERK1/2 in MCF-7 cells (Figure 6D\u2013G). Previous study demonstrated that DUSP6 is a key ERK-specific phosphatase that induces dephosphorylation of ERK1/2, negatively regulating the ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, it suggests that ERK1/2 signaling may associate with CCL17-induced BC cell migration and invasion.Correlation analyses in BC tissuesCorrelation analysis between DUSP6 and CCL17 in BC tissues. (A) DUSP6 mRNA levels in BC tissues (n=140) and corresponding adjacent-normal tissues (n=140) were measured by Real-time Quantitative PCR. (B) Pearson correlation scatter plots in BC tissues (n=140). ***P<0.001.Abbreviation: BC, breast cancer. We next investigate DUSP6 expression by Real-time Quantitative PCR in tumor tissues from BC patients. DUSP6 expression was decreased in tumor tissues compared with their corresponding adjacent-normal controls (Figure 7A). Pearson correlation analysis showed that DUSP6 mRNA expression was negatively correlated with the mRNA expression of CCL17 in BC tissues (Figure 7B). These data further supported the findings in BC cell lines.DiscussionThere are reports shown that development of cancer is not only dependent on tumor cells, but also co-mediated by the tumor microenvironment. CAFs, the most common stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment, significantly contribute to tumor initiation, proliferation, invasion, migration, metastasis, and drug resistance in various types of cancers, including BC. It has been well established that chemokines and their receptors are participated in the cross-talk of fibroblasts and cancer cells. Here, we focused on the function of CAF-associated CCL17 in cell invasion and migration of BC via a clinical exploration and in vitro investigation. In this study, we showed that CCL17 levels were significantly up-regulated in BC tissues, peripheral blood, and CAFs compared with their corresponding controls, respectively. CCL17 expression was correlated with lymph nodes, TNM stage and tumor size of BC patients. CAFs or NFs-derived CCL17 may promote BC cell invasion and migration through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway.It is worth noting that the CCL17 plays an important role in promoting cancer progression. In fact, our clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that high CCL17 expression was correlated with advanced TNM stage, larger tumor size and increased lymph node metastasis, indicating that CCL17 is associated with the aggressiveness of BC. Consistent with our findings, CCL17 expression was found increased in BC tissues in comparison to normal tissues. CCL17 recruits CCR4 positive regulatory T cells and promotes lung metastasis of BC. Moreover, CCR4 positively correlates with lymph node metastasis in BC patients, supporting our result of higher expression of CCL17 in BC patients with positive lymph nodes. However, CCL17 mRNA expression was correlated with races and HER2 status, but age and stage were not found to be correlated with CCL17 expression in BC. Weide et al, reported that serum CCL17 level was lower in melanoma patients compared with healthy controls. Similar finding in our study was that of a statistically significant increase of CCL17 content in peripheral blood in BC patients compared with healthy controls, and CCL17 may therefore as differentiation maker between BC and healthy women.Many groups have identified that CAFs significantly contributed to cancer progression. For example, CAFs-derived interleukin 32 (IL32) promotes BC cell invasion and metastasis via integrin \u03b23-p38 MAPK signaling. CAFs promoted hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis by CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, and CXCL16 through hedgehog and TGF-\u03b2 pathways. CAFs promoted integrin \u03b21 clustering and invasiveness in gastric cancer through activating CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Our study showed that CAFs-induced BC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and CCR4 expression were significantly reversed by CCL17 down-regulation in CAFs, while the tumor-promoting effects of NFs on BC were markedly strengthened by CCL17 up-regulation in NFs. Since CCL17 activates ERK1/2 signaling and CCR4 acts as a downstream target of ERK1/2/NF-\u03baB pathway, we indicate that CCL17 positively regulates CCR4 protein levels through activating ERK1/2 signaling. CCL17/CCR4 signaling is of great importance in CAFs/NFs-induced BC metastasis. In line with our findings, CCL17 originating from CXCL14-activated fibroblasts that display phenotypes similar to CAFs can markedly increase migration and invasion abilities of BC cells and is potentially associated with EMT, which is markedly inhibited by CCR4 down-regulation. Moreover, CCR4 enhances the chemotactic response of BC cells to CCL17, promotes BC cell growth and metastasis in vivo, but has no effect on BC cell proliferation in vitro. It is acknowledged that normal fibroblasts are often considered to be tumor suppressive. Meanwhile, NFs also have no effect on regulating cancer cells in the co-culture system. Therefore, the role of NFs in tumorigenesis needs to be further investigated.Previous study also showed that CXCL14 secreted by BC cells activated mammary fibroblasts through the ERK1/2 pathway, and activated CAFs promoted the cell migration and metastasis of BC through the CCL17/CCR4 axis. In the present study, CAFs or NFs-induced ERK1/2 activation and its downstream signaling effector MMP13 in BC cells were inhibited by CCL17 knockdown in CAFs and strengthened by CCL17 overexpression in NFs, respectively. DUSP6 is an effective phosphatase that reverses ERK1/2 phosphorylation and is therefore a negative regulator of MAPK activity, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role of DUSP6 via pivotal negative feedback regulation of the ERK1/2 in diverse cancers. Treatment of BC cells with recombinant CCL17 significantly increased CCR4 while decreased DUSP6 expression in a dose-dependent manner. DUSP6 overexpression markedly inhibited cell invasion, migration, MMP13 expression and the ERK1/2 activation in MCF-7 cells with recombinant CCL17. These findings suggest DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway may involve in BC invasion and migration induced by CAFs-derived CCL17. MMP13 is known to promote BC cell invasion and metastasis and be associated with overall survival of BC patients. Stimulation of regulatory T cells with CCL17/CCR4 can phosphorylate ERK1/2, and CCR4 up-regulates MMP13 expression through ERK1/2 in colorectal cancer. Similarly, Zhao et al, also reported that CCL17/CCR4 axis can induce the metastasis of bladder cancer cells by promoting ERK1/2 signaling and MMP13 expression. CXCL12/CXCR4 promoted laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis through MMP-13-dependent invasion via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Since DUSP6 undergoes highly specific interaction with ERK1/2, which leads to the DUSP6 inactivation, we suggest that CCL17 may regulate the DUSP6 levels through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, contrary to a tumor-suppressive role of DUSP6 in cancers, DUSP6 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated decreased cell migration and invasion. Therefore, DUSP6 may play its functions depending on the histological subtypes of the cells.ConclusionIn conclusion, our study elucidated that regulation of CCL17 expression in CAFs promoted cell invasion and migration of BC through DUSP6-dependent ERK1/2 pathway. These findings suggest that CAFs-derived CCL17 could be potential therapeutic targets for BC metastasis, although the further mechanistic study is warranted.Supplementary materialsDisclosureThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.ReferencesMFG-E8 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patientsPlasma chemokine CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 concentrations as diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer patientsAndrogen receptor in triple negative breast cancer: a potential target for the targetless subtypeThe chemokine receptor CCR4 promotes tumor growth and lung metastasis in breast cancerBioinformatics analysis revealing prognostic significance of RRM2 gene in breast cancerKRT19 and CEACAM5 mRNA-marked circulated tumor cells indicate unfavorable prognosis of breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-derived IL32 promotes breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis via integrin beta3-p38 MAPK signallingPhenotypic and functional heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast within the tumor microenvironmentTGF-beta receptor type-2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts regulates breast cancer cell growth and survival and is a prognostic marker in pre-menopausal breast cancerDown-regulation of miR-29b in carcinoma associated fibroblasts promotes cell growth and metastasis of breast cancerCancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated in cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and in the peritumoural skinCXCL12/CXCR4 activation by cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes integrin beta1 clustering and invasiveness in gastric cancerThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerCCL17/TARC and CCR4 expression in Merkel cell carcinomaBreast cancer lung metastasis requires expression of chemokine receptor CCR4 and regulatory T cellsAJUBA promotes the migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells through upregulation of MMP10 and MMP13 expressionBiochemical and biological attributes of matrix metalloproteinasesZinc finger protein 143 expression is closely related to tumor malignancy via regulating cell motility in breast cancerCCL17-CCR4 axis promotes metastasis via ERK/MMP13 pathway in bladder cancerCXCL12/CXCR4 promotes laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma metastasis through MMP-13-dependent invasion via the ERK1/2/AP-1 pathwayDUSP6/MKP3 is overexpressed in papillary and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and contributes to neoplastic properties of thyroid cancer cellsSilencing of DUSP6 gene by RNAi-mediation inhibits proliferation and growth in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells: an in vitro studyLncRNA expression signatures of twist-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in MCF10A cellsCullin3 promotes breast cancer cells metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting BRMS1 for degradationDeubiquitinase USP47/UBP64E regulates beta-catenin ubiquitination and degradation and plays a positive role in Wnt signalingDual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6): a review of its molecular characteristics and clinical relevance in cancerRecent advances in understanding tumor stroma-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancerCC chemokines are differentially expressed in breast cancer and are associated with disparity in overall survivalIncreased CCL17 serum levels are associated with improved survival in advanced melanomaCancer-associated fibroblasts promote hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through chemokine-activated hedgehog and TGF-beta pathwaysCorrection: CCR4 promotes metastasis via ERK/NF-kappaB/MMP13 pathway and acts downstream of TNF-alpha in colorectal cancerHIC1 deletion promotes breast cancer progression by activating tumor cell/fibroblast crosstalkBiological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between carcinoma-associated fibroblasts and their paired normal fibroblasts in human breast cancerTumor suppressor dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) impairs cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated phenotypeDual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) is an ETS-regulated negative feedback mediator of oncogenic ERK signaling in lung cancer cellsSelective deregulation in chemokine signaling pathways of CD4+CD25(hi)CD127(lo)/(-) regulatory T cells in human allergic asthmaThe nuclear factor NF-kappaB pathway in inflammationDUSP6/MKP-3 inactivates ERK1/2 but fails to bind and inactivate ERK5"

Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined.

Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

Tumors of the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer (TNBC; generally corresponding to the \u201cBasal/Basal-like\u201d subtype of patient datasets, determined by PAM50 gene signatures) lack the expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1, progesterone receptor and HER2, are highly aggressive and are most likely to recur. Unlike the luminal-A tumors that are characterized by better survival, or the HER2+ tumors, TNBC/basal tumors cannot be treated by receptor-targeted therapies and demonstrate high relapse rates following chemotherapy.As with other malignancies, breast tumors develop and progress within an intimate tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies indicate that stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key regulators of tumor progression in cancer. In general, MSCs enrich the TME with tumor-promoting factors, and endow the tumor cells with improved abilities to invade and generate metastases; MSCs also undergo transition to CAFs that promote breast cancer/TNBC progression. Particularly in TNBC, MSCs contribute to higher aggressiveness by promoting the expression of angiogenic factors and pro-metastatic chemokines such as the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts). The axes established by these chemokines and their receptors are well-known for their pro-tumorigenic roles, including in TNBC [e.g., ].Tumor-educated MSCs evolve within a TME enriched with inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which generally promote breast cancer progression. Two such pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). It was demonstrated that despite its potential anti-tumor cytotoxic activities, chronic presence of TNF\u03b1 in tumors has led to tumor progression. Joined with the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory activities of IL-1\u03b2, the two cytokines were identified as pro-metastatic factors in many tumor types. In TNBC, sequencing, serum-profiling and immunohistochemistry studies of small patient cohorts provided initial evidence to relevance of high expression of the two cytokines or of their signaling components to metastasis in TNBC patients; in parallel, studies in animal models have demonstrated causative tumor-promoting roles for TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also connected with pro-malignancy activities of MSCs and CAFs in TNBC. Specifically with regards to chemokines, we and others have shown that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 elevated the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts) by MSCs [; the degree of increase depended on assay conditions], thus promoting the pro-inflammatory and pro-malignancy phenotype of these stromal cells.However, to date, we still lack understanding of the interactions that are established between TNBC cells, stromal cells and their intimate pro-inflammatory TME, and we do not have enough information on the way such interactions affect disease course. Specifically, it is not known whether the pro-metastatic characteristics of the TME and of the tumor cells are increased when TNBC cells interact with MSCs/CAFs in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Thus, the aim of our present study was to identify the influence of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage on the content of pro-metastatic chemokines as proxies for potential pro-malignancy activities that enrich the TME of TNBC tumors, as well as on angiogenesis and on the migratory, invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells.In view of their high relevance to tumor progression in TNBC, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were selected as representatives of the pro-inflammatory TME in our study. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of TNBC:stroma co-cultures by these two cytokines has led to increased pro-metastatic activities at multiple levels, including: expression levels of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, cancer cell morphology, tumor cell migration and tumor cell invasion. Importantly, we found that CXCL8 was a key regulator of the pro-metastatic activities that came into play in the TNBC-stroma-inflammation networks, including angiogenesis, metastasis-related morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Moreover, the tumor-stroma-inflammation network has promoted the metastatic potential of TNBC cells and has led to elevated metastasis in vivo. Parallel in-culture studies that were performed with tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with luminal-A cells demonstrated that in general they were less potent or differently active than those established with TNBC cells.Thus, our findings set the pro-inflammatory inputs acting at the tumor:stroma interface, and their pro-metastatic outputs, as targets for improved therapy in TNBC. Since inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are used vastly in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, our findings suggest that these two cytokines may be considered as novel therapeutic modalities in TNBC. Such an approach, combined with the use of chemokine receptor inhibitors [e.g., of the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2; ], may prevent tumor-stroma interactions that increase metastasis in TNBC.Materials and MethodsAnalyses of Patient DatasetsRNAseq-based gene expression analyses of breast cancer patient data were performed with the TCGA dataset. Subtypes were defined based on the PAM50 annotation file provided within the dataset: Basal (often overlapping the term TNBC): 141 patients; Luminal-A: 421 patients. Gene expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were determined. In all analyses, log2-transformed expression values of the genes were presented. Statistical analyses were performed following Shapiro-Wilk test, determining the normality of distribution for each gene by individual subtype. Comparisons of gene expression levels between the two clinical subtypes were presented in boxplots. p-values were determined by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The distribution of gene expression levels in basal and luminal-A patients was presented in histograms, where statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. In studies correlating the expression levels of the different genes, correlation coefficients and p-values were analyzed using Spearman correlation. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Breast Tumor Cell Lines and Stromal CellsThe human TNBC cell lines (all from ATCC) included: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells that were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Life technologies, Grand island, NY); BT-549 cells that were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Biological Industries); for BT-549 cells, recombinant human (rh) insulin (10 mg/ml; #I9278; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the medium. The human luminal-A cell lines MCF-7 (from ATCC) and T47D [provided by Dr. Keydar who generated the cell line ] were grown in culture in the same medium as MDA-MB-231 cells. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial ST1.6R cells (HPMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Unger and Dr. Kirkpatrick, Institute of Pathology, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. These cells were grown as described in Krump-Konvalinkova et al., with minor modifications.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from Lonza (#PT-2501; Walkersville, MD), which validated them as MSCs based on cell markers and differentiation potential. Routine growth of MSCs took place in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (#PT-3001; Lonza) or in MesenCult (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) and they were used for up to 10 passages. In this study, MSCs of four different healthy donors were used. Patient-derived CAFs from a primary breast tumor (used in ELISA and their accompanying signaling experiments) and from a lung metastasis (used in tumor cell invasion assays) were kindly provided by Dr. Bar, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel). The cells were grown, identified and immortalized as described in Katanov et al..TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Concentrations Used in Different AnalysesTitration studies were initiated by determining the ability of rhTNF\u03b1 (#300-01A, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and rhIL-1\u03b2 (#200-01B, PeproTech) to elevate in MDA-MB-231 cells and/or MSCs/CAFs the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and/or CCL5 to levels that enabled us to perform the required comparisons between different cell combinations in ELISA studies (concentrations studied - TNF\u03b1: 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2: 20, 100, 250, 350, 500, 750 pg/ml). The selected concentrations of 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2 were appropriate also for MSC and CAF experiments. Therefore, in all MDA-MB-231 studies, alone or with MSC/CAF, these selected concentrations were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments.In parallel, titration studies indicated that the above selected concentrations were not optimal for ELISA responses of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cells; thus, based on additional analyses, the concentrations of cytokines were raised in these two cell types: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. These selected cytokine concentrations were used in all studies of MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells, alone or with MSCs.The effects of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 on morphological changes, angiogenesis, migration and invasion with MCF-7 cells were determined in the same concentrations as used for MDA-MB-231 cells (10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2). In ELISA studies (and their accompanying signaling experiments) in MCF-7 and T47D cells cytokine concentrations were raised to 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. Although published data [e.g., ] and our past studies indicated that lower TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (as in MDA-MB-231 cells) induce signaling and up-regulate the levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 in MCF-7 and T47D cells, we expected that these cytokine concentrations will not enable us to clearly distinguish \u201cintermediate\u201d levels of chemokine induction in ELISA assays. Thus, cytokine concentrations were increased, as described above.Western Blot StudiesBased on kinetics analyses (Data not shown), cells were stimulated for 15 min by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle (similar for both cytokines), in medium containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, followed by conventional Western blot (WB) procedures. The following antibodies (Abs) were used: Phosphorylated (P)-p65 [#3033; Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA]; Total (T)-p65 (#8242; CST); P-JNK (#4668; CST); T-JNK (#9258; CST). Abs directed against GAPDH (#ab9485; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) served for loading controls. The membranes were reacted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (#111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (#20-500, Biological Industries).Cell Stimulation in Co-culture ExperimentsTNBC or luminal-A cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs/CAFs (10:1 ratio) in 6-well plates (#3516, Corning, Kennebunk, ME). When relevant, \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures were grown in similar plates, in which the two cell types were separated by an insert of 0.4 \u03bcm permeable polycarbonate membrane (#3412, Corning). In parallel, each cell type was grown individually in the same cell numbers as in co-cultures, in similar plates. The cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS for 12 h, and were then treated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle for 7 h in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Then, media were replaced by cytokine-free media (with 0.5% FBS) for additional 60 h. Cell conditioned media (CM) were removed and taken for ELISA assays. When indicated, CM and cell lysates were produced from cells that were subjected to gene down-regulation by siRNA, as detailed below. Cell lysates were produced from cells grown in larger vessels 7 h or 15 min after the beginning of cytokine stimulation and were used in quantitative real-time PCR analyses (qRT-PCR) or in WB studies.ELISA AssaysCM obtained from different stimulatory conditions were cleared by centrifugation, followed by determining the expression levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 by ELISA. Standard curves at the linear range of absorbance were produced with rhCXCL8, rhCCL2 and rhCCL5 (#200-8M, #300-04 and #300-06, respectively; PeproTech). The following Abs were used (all from PeproTech, unless otherwise indicated): For CXCL8 - Coating Abs: #500-P28; Detecting Abs: #500-P28Bt. For CCL2 - Coating Abs: #500-M71; Detecting Abs: #500-P34Bt. For CCL5 - Coating Abs: #500-M75; Detecting Abs: #BAF278 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (#016-030-084; Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories) was added, followed by the substrate TMB/E solution (#ES001; Millipore, Temecula, CA); then, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To provide data on the contents of chemokines generated in each of the treatments and to clearly denote the differences in chemokine production between the different conditions, the findings are presented in ng/ml.In reversibility experiments, MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 for 67 h or exposed to vehicle control. Media were replaced and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in TNF\u03b1-free media. CM that were collected following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal, were subjected to ELISA analysis of CXCL8 expression as described above.qRT-PCR AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted using the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400; Biological Industries). Using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX), first-strand cDNA was generated from RNA samples. cDNA targets were quantified by qRT-PCR on Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science, Concorde, NSW, Australia). Absolute Blue qPCR SYBR Green ROX mix (#AB-4163/A; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect transcripts, according to manufacturer's instructions. Two pairs of specific primers were used (Supplementary Table 1), designed to span different exons. Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Dissociation curves for each primer set indicated a single product, and \u201cno-template\u201d controls were negative after the 40 cycles used for analysis. Quantification was performed by standard curves, within the linear range of quantification.Endothelial Cell Migration and SproutingTo generate CM for functional in vitro angiogenesis assays, MDA-MB-231:MSC and MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10:1 cell ratio in each) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 7 h; in parallel, CM were produced from tumor cells that were treated by vehicle, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1, or from tumor cells grown with MSCs only. Media were removed and the cells were cultured for additional 60 h in TNF\u03b1-free medium (with 0.5% FBS). CM were collected, cleared by filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane, and loaded in the lower part of migration transwells (#3422, Corning) with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes. The migration of HPMEC cells in direction of the different CM was determined after up to 90 min. At the end of the experiments, cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes, the membranes were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained by Hemacolor (#1.11661; Merck). Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple bright fields were counted.In parallel, CM were also used in sprouting assays of mCherry-expressing HPMECs out of 3D multicellular spheroids (all generated by the same cell number) that were formed in hanging drops for 24 h and embedded into collagen type I (1.3 mg/ml; #354236; Corning). Sprouting of endothelial cells in response to CM was visualized by fluorescent microscopy after 10 days, and was determined quantitatively in multiple spheroids by mCherry signals of cells that sprouted out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ.Tumor Cell Morphology, Migration and InvasionIn morphology assays, \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-expressing tumor cells - MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 - and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 67 h; in parallel, mCherry-tumor cells were grown with vehicle, with TNF\u03b1 only or with MSCs only. Then, tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy at x100 magnification, in multiple fields. In reversibility experiments of MDA-MB-231 cells, media were replaced in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures after 67 h, and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in cytokine-free medium. Morphology was determined following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal.Migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in transwells with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes (#3422, Corning). In these assays, mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were added to the upper part of the chambers, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. The same number of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in parallel transwells, in the presence of vehicle control or of TNF\u03b1 alone. Migration was performed for 12 h toward medium containing 10% FBS [containing TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, as appropriate]. The numbers of migrating tumor cells were determined by staining with rabbit Abs to RPF (recognizing mCherry; #PM005; MBL, Woburn, MA), followed by DyLight 550-conjugated Donkey Abs recognizing rabbit IgG (#ab96920, Abcam). Cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Based on DyLight 550 signals and Hemacolor staining used in preliminary analyses (Data not shown), we validated that close to 100% of migrating cells were the tumor cells. Photos of multiple high power fluorescent fields were taken at \u00d7 100 magnification. Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple fluorescence fields were counted.Migration of Hoechst-labeled MCF-7 cells was determined by using the same experimental groups as in TNBC studies. MCF-7 cells are known as having a relatively low basal migratory potential, thus appropriate conditions were set, based on published studies and preliminary analyses in our lab. Thus, the membranes were coated with fibronectin for 1 h (20 \u03bcg/ml; #03-090-1, Biological Industries), cells were loaded to the upper part and after 21 h photos were taken. Hoechst-expressing tumor cells that migrated to the lower side of the membranes were counted in multiple fields.Tumor cell invasion assays were performed using 3D multicellular spheroids that were generated for 72 h in hanging-drops [, with minor modifications]. Spheroids of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, consisting of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs/CAFs (ratio 10:1) were embedded into matrigel (9\u201310.5 mg/ml; #356234, Corning) and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Spheroids were also formed with mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells alone, and treated by TNF\u03b1 or by vehicle (same number of cells as in co-cultures). Invasion of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells was determined 48 h after the addition of cytokine stimulation (or vehicle). Multiple spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields at x40 magnification. The invaded area was determined by the mCherry signals of cells that invaded out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ. Invasion of MCF-7 cells was determined in a similar manner after 96 h, using mCherry-MCF-7 cells and patient-derived CAFs, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or its vehicle control. Spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields 96 h after the addition of stimulation, at \u00d7 40 magnification.CXCL8 Down-Regulation by siRNAKnock-down of CXCL8 expression by transient siRNA transfections was performed in both MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs, using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (#56531; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGET plus siRNA CXCL8 SMART pool and non-targeting control siRNA pool (siCTRL) were used (#L-004756-00 and #D-001810-10, respectively; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The efficacy of CXCL8 down-regulation was validated by qRT-PCR or ELISA [Data not shown; 80\u201390% as in ] and the cells were used in assays, as necessary.Tumor Growth and Metastasis\u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs (10:1 ratio) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or vehicle control, in 0.5% FBS-containing medium for 67 h. In each group (Group 1: Co-culture with TNF\u03b1; Group 2: Co-culture with vehicle), the same amount of live co-cultured cells was mixed 1:1 with matrigel (final concentration 4.5 mg/ml; #356234; Corning). The cells were administered orthotopically to the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (#NUDE242; Envigo RMS, Jerusalem, Israel). During the experiment, tumors of Group 1 were supplemented every 3 days by CM taken from MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures; these CM were generated as follows: The co-cultures were stimulated for 7 h with TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), after which the cytokine was removed, and CM were collected after additional 60 h of growth in cytokine-free and serum-free medium. These CM were filtered, concentrated \u00d7 10, and administered in proximity to tumors. Cytokine- and serum-free media that were put in parallel flasks have undergone similar procedures, and were administered to tumors of Group 2. At the endpoint of experiments (when tumors reached detectable sizes and had to be removed prior to necrosis), approximately 30 days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were sacrificed and primary tumors and lungs were excised. Tumor weights were determined, and tumor volumes were calculated based on caliper measurements. Lung metastases were determined ex vivo by the CRi Maestro non-invasive intravital imaging system. The total number of mice that were included in two biological repeats were 12 in Group 1, and 11 in Group 2. Statistical analyses of primary tumor weight and volume were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. The proportions of mice bearing lung metastases were compared by Fisher's exact test. Procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines and policies.Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysesThe statistical analyses of TCGA analyses and in vivo experiments were described in their respective sections. In vitro experiments were performed in n \u2265 3 independent experimental repeats, with MSCs from \u22652 different donors, as indicated in respective figure legends. The results of ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, HPMEC sprouting and tumor cell migration and invasion assays were compared by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling the FDR at 0.05. All the significant results remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity, except for some of the WB results. It these latter cases lack of significance was due to high variance between the intensities of effects of the experimental repeats of the test, despite the fact that they all demonstrated the same trend. Thus, in presentation of WB analyses we demonstrate not only the average and standard deviations (SD) of the experimental repeats but also the level of effect in each experiment.ResultsHigh Expression Levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Are Noted in Tumors of Basal Patients and Are Significantly Coordinated With High Expression Levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5To identify the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating tumor-stroma interactions in TNBC, we have extended currently-available studies on TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients and compared the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in two subtypes of breast tumors: (1) Basal tumors, corresponding to the TNBC subtype, which has a most aggressive phenotype; (2) Luminal-A tumors having the best prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes.Here, by using the TCGA breast cancer dataset we found that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were expressed in significantly higher levels in basal tumors than in luminal-A tumors (Figures 1A1,B1). Distribution analyses (Figures 1A2,B2) demonstrated a larger proportion of basal patients with high TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels, than luminal-A patients. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, chosen as proxies for pro-tumorigenic factors that may be enriched in basal patients due to pro-inflammatory signals. These studies demonstrated significantly higher levels of the three chemokines in basal patients than in luminal-A patients (Figures 1C\u2013E).The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their chemokine targets are significantly higher in basal patients than in luminal-A patients. The Figure demonstrates gene expression analyses, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) TNF\u03b1, (B) IL-1\u03b2, (C) CXCL8, (D) CCL2, (E) CCL5.

(A2\u2013E2) Histograms demonstrating the distribution of expression levels of each of the factors in basal and luminal-A patient tumors. RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Moreover, as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are key inducers of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 expression [e.g., ] we also determined the correlation between the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and each of the three chemokines in basal patients. The findings of Figure 2 indicate that the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly correlated and coordinated with the presence of CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 in basal tumors.In basal patients, the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are significantly coordinated with the expression levels of their chemokine targets. The Figure demonstrates correlation analyses of gene expression in basal patients, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) CXCL8 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (A1) and IL-1\u03b2 (A2). (B) CCL2 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (B1) and IL-1\u03b2 (B2). (C) CCL5 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (C1) and IL-1\u03b2 (C2). RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Pro-metastatic Chemokines Reach Their Highest Expression Levels When TNBC:Stroma \u201cContact\u201d Co-cultures Are Stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2To follow up on the above findings, we asked how the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 regulate TNBC:MSC interactions that may lead to elevated release of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. First, we validated that the two cytokines could activate transcription pathways that typically induce the expression of these chemokines, namely NF-\u03baB/p65 and JNK/AP-1. Indeed, these pathways were rapidly activated by a brief TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of 15 min (time point and cytokine concentrations were determined by preliminary analyses) in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and in MSCs (Figure 3A).CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK, determined by WB in MSCs and in human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells upon 15 min stimulation by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle control (based on kinetics and titration studies. Information on cytokine concentrations is given in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). GAPDH was used as a loading control. (A1) A representative experiment and (A2) averages \u00b1 SD of p65 and JNK activation (fold induction) in n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. ***p < 0.001, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between the values obtained for cytokine-stimulated cells and control non-stimulated cells. Dashed line stands for the value of 1 given to control cells. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels were determined in TNBC:MSC co-cultures or each of the cell types grown alone, with or without TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs were generated in \u201cTranswell\u201d and \u201cContact\u201d conditions and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (350 pg/ml) or vehicle control (similar for both cytokines) for 7 h. After change of media and growth for additional 60 h, the extracellular expression of CXCL8 in TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-free CM was determined by ELISA. ***p \u2264 0.001, **p \u2264 0.01, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between TNF\u03b1- or IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells and vehicle-treated cells, within each group. #p-values were <0.01 or <0.001 (in most cases) in comparisons of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments, as well as in comparisons of \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments. The results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.Then, to determine if CXCL8 is regulated by tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures were plated in \u201cContact\u201d conditions that enabled direct physical contacts between the two cell types or in \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions that allowed only for the exchange of soluble factors between tumor cells and stromal cells. These co-cultures and each cell type alone were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (or their vehicle) for 7 h (Cytokine concentrations were selected based on titration assays, as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d); the cytokines were removed and cytokine-free CM were collected 60 h later. These experiments revealed that the highest levels of CXCL8 were produced when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B1), and that they were higher than in all other conditions including non-stimulated co-cultures and individual cell types treated with either cytokine. CXCL8 protein levels were elevated also in cytokine-stimulated \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions; however, their total levels (ng/ml) were significantly lower than in cytokine-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 3B1). Accompanying qRT-PCR analyses indicated that CXCL8 induction was regulated at the transcription level (Supplementary Figure 1A), and that increased CXCL8 levels in cytokine-stimulated co-cultures did not result of elevated proliferation of the cells under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 2). Accordingly, we did not detect any substantial cell death or proliferation of any of the cell types due to cellular interactions or cytokine stimulation (Data not shown).Additional experiments revealed similar regulatory modes for CCL2, demonstrating its highest expression levels in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures, obtained partly in a contact-dependent process (Figure 3B2). With CCL5, absolute dependence on TNBC:MSC contacts was revealed, and its expression was further elevated when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B3). As with CXCL8, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 by elevating their mRNA levels (Supplementary Figures 1B,C).Additional analyses performed with TNBC cells that interacted with breast cancer patient-derived CAFs revealed similar regulatory patterns to those described above with MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures: TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation in CAFs (Figure 4A) and elevated all three pro-metastatic chemokines to their highest levels of expression when tumor-stroma-inflammation interactions took place (Figure 4B); moreover, CXCL8 and CCL2 up-regulation depended partly on cell-to-cell contacts whereas induction of CCL5 was fully dependent on direct physical contacts between the tumor cells and the CAFs, and was further induced by stimulation with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:CAF \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, using similar cytokine concentrations. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.In view of the high heterogeneity of TNBC tumors, we asked if similar regulatory patterns exist in co-cultures of other human TNBC cells - MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 - with MSCs. The findings of Figure 5A indicate that in both cell lines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation and that the highest CXCL8 expression levels were produced when these TNBC cells physically interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5B). Of interest, the elevation in CXCL8 levels following cytokine stimulation of MDA-MB-468:MSC co-cultures partly depended on physical contacts between the two cell types (Figure 5B1), as was seen in MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures (Figure 3B1). In parallel, in BT-549:MSC co-cultures, CXCL8 elevation in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells depended on cell-to-cell contacts, while TNF\u03b1 did not have much of an impact under \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 5B2).Increased production of CXCL8 is a general characteristic of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with TNBC cells. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with human TNBC MDA-MB-468, BT-549 cells and MSCs. Cytokine concentrations: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. \u2227In panel 5B1, this value was significant in 2 out of 3 experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.To follow up on the data of Figure 1, indicating that the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their targets - CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 - were significantly lower in luminal-A patients than in basal patients, we determined how these three chemokines are affected by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of luminal-A:MSC co-cultures. Despite the fact that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced potent p65 and JNK activation in T47D and MCF-7 luminal-A cells (Figures 6A, 7A), CXCL8 levels were not increased but rather were decreased when the tumor cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figures 6B1, 7B). In parallel, CCL2 and CCL5 levels were increased by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated T47D:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (Figures 6B2,B3), but their expression levels were, in general, much lower than those obtained by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures (Figures 3B2,B3). Further studies with MCF-7 luminal-A cells demonstrated elevations in the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 in some of the assays under \u201cContact\u201d co-culture conditions following TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation; however, the expression levels of these chemokines were often too low to provide clear-cut results (Data not shown).CXCL8 expression is down-regulated in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated luminal-A (T47D): MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with T47D cells and MSCs.

(B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels. \u2227In panel B2, comparisons to non-stimulated MSCs were non-reproducible.

To this end, in the TNBC part we focused on the MDA-MB-231 cells because of their high metastatic potential. In luminal-A studies we chose to investigate MCF-7 cells because of our previous research indicating that they expressed more robust metastasis-related properties than T47D cells when stimulated by pro-inflammatory signals; additional investigations by our group also indicated that MCF-7 cells responded vigorously to TNF\u03b1-containing TME signals in in vivo metastasis studies.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Established With TNBC Cells Lead to Elevated AngiogenesisTo determine the functional consequences of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, we first determined the ability of factors released by TNBC:MSC co-cultures stimulated by TNF\u03b1 to promote processes involved in angiogenesis. Here, endothelial cells (HPMEC) sprouting assays demonstrated conclusive evidence to higher angiogenesis-supporting potential of TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC (Supplementary Figure 3) compared to CM obtained from control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, these studies did not reveal concrete information on the angiogenic potential of CM obtained from tumor cells + MSCs or from tumor cells + TNF\u03b1. Thus, additional studies were designed to provide another level of information on the ability of CM derived from the different groups to induce the migration of HPMEC in response to CM derived from different conditions. This assay enabled us to clearly demonstrate that the highest levels of endothelial cell migration were achieved when MDA-MB-231 cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 8A). Moreover, our findings emphasized the contribution of TNF\u03b1 to the angiogenic potential revealed by tumor cells grown in the presence of stromal cells.The pro-angiogenic activities of factors released by tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are promoted by TNF\u03b1 in TNBC but not in luminal-A cells.

Photos and their quantifications are representatives of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.We then performed parallel studies with luminal-A MCF-7 cells and found that CM of \u201cContact\u201d MCF-7:MSC co-cultures had strong angiogenic activities as with TNBC cells (Figure 8B); however, in contrast to our studies with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8A), in studies of MCF-7 cells TNF\u03b1 did not push the angiogenic response induced by CM of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures any further.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Promote the Migratory and Invasive Properties of TNBC CellsNext, we determined the effects of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network on tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. First, we found that in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, the tumor cells acquired very elongated morphology (Figure 9A1) which is typical of cells that express high motility capabilities. The morphology of the tumor cells under this condition was robustly different from the morphology of tumor cells grown alone, of tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and of tumor cells grown with MSCs only (Figure 9A1). These studies were followed by migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells, known as having an aggressive phenotype which is manifested by a relatively high basal migratory potential. Despite their high basal motility, the interactions of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 have led to significantly higher migratory capacity of the tumor cells compared to tumor cells grown alone (Figure 9A2). Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells grown in the presence of MSCs only or with TNF\u03b1 alone did not migrate as well as tumor cells grown with MSCs and TNF\u03b1 (Figure 9A2). Supplementary Figure 4 demonstrates representative photos of MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated in the different study groups, identified by fluorescent staining.TNBC cells, and less so luminal-A cells, acquire migration-related characteristics upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1.

In all sections of Part (B), the Figures demonstrate representative experiments of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of \u22652 different donors.In parallel, experiments performed with MCF-7 cells indicated that their morphology was modified by TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 9B1) toward a metastasis-relevant phenotype [in line with our findings in ]. MCF-7 cells that grew in contact with MSCs also demonstrated modifications in their morphology, different than those induced by TNF\u03b1 stimulation. However, in contrast to our findings with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A1), when TNF\u03b1 was added to MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, no additivity was found between TNF\u03b1 and the MSCs in inducing more robust morphological changes in the tumor cells (Figure 9B1). Of note, the TNF\u03b1-stimulated MCF-7 cells that grew in co-culture with MSCs acquired elevated migratory capacity compared to control cells (Figure 9B2; Supplementary Figure 5). However, the overall migratory potential of MCF-7 cells at the tumor-stroma-inflammation setting (Figure 9B2) was much lower of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A2), although the two cell types were plated in same numbers in migration transwells. The relatively low migratory capacities of MCF-7 cells were noted despite the fact that they were given the proper conditions to support their migration (fibronectin coating of membranes and longer migration time than MDA-MB-231 cells).To follow up on these findings, we investigated the ability of TNBC cells to invade out of 3D spheroids, a process requiring migration and invasion through extracellular proteins. We noted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells when they interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 10), compared to all other cell combinations. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells exerted significantly increased invasion also when they interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the context of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 11A; Please see \u201cNote\u201d in the legend of Figure 11A). In contrast to the TNBC cells, MCF-7 luminal-A cells that interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 demonstrated very minor, if any, invasive properties (Figure 11B), even after longer invasion time compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (96 h for MCF-7 cells; 48 h for MDA-MB-231 cells).TNBC cells acquire elevated invasive properties upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1. The Figure demonstrates tumor cell invasion out of 3D spheroids that were formed by mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) alone or by tumor cells in \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs. The spheroids were imbedded into matrigel and then stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle for 48 h. (A) Representative photos. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.

Bar, 200 \u03bcm.TNBC-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Lead Through CXCL8 Activities to Increased Angiogenesis, as Well as to Elevated Migration and Invasion of TNBC CellsThe findings demonstrated so far indicated that tumor-stroma-inflammation networks can lead in TNBC to (1) increased production of pro-metastatic chemokines such as CXCL8 and (2) elevated angiogenesis, tumor cell migration and invasion. To connect between these two processes, we asked if CXCL8 - selected because of its robust pro-angiogenic activities and pro-metastatic effects at the levels of TME and the tumor cells alike - was involved in mediating the functional properties of TNBC cells when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established.To this end, we generated TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in which CXCL8 was down-regulated in high efficiency by siRNA in the tumor cells and in the MSCs simultaneously [80\u201390% efficiency was found in CXCL8 down-regulation by the siRNA, similar to our findings in our parallel study; that study also demonstrates which of the cells contributed more to CXCL8 production when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established with MDA-MB-231 cells]. The findings of Figure 12 clearly indicate that CXCL8 played significant roles in driving forward all metastasis-related alterations that were induced by the tumor-stroma-inflammation network in TNBC. Here, we found that in the absence of CXCL8 expression, endothelial cell migration in response to CM of TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures was significantly reduced (Figure 12A). Moreover, upon CXCL8 down-regulation, the migration-relevant morphology of the tumor cells was partly reversed (Figure 12B), and the migration and particularly the invasion potentials of the tumor cells were significantly reduced (Figures 12C,D).Tumor-stroma-inflammation networks lead through CXCL8 activities to increased angiogenesis, invasion-related tumor cell morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) and MSCs were both transfected by siCXCL8 or siCTRL. Parallel studies indicated that the efficiency of CXCL8 down-regulation was high [80\u201390% in most experiments, as in; Data not shown]. The cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml); then, the cells or their CM were assayed in the following tests: (A) Endothelial cell migration (Procedures as in Figure 8A). ***p < 0.001; (B) Tumor cell morphology (Procedures as in Figure 9A1).

Yet, they have not directly determined the impact of the pro-inflammatory signals on tumor growth and metastasis when TNBC:stroma interactions are established. Our above findings motivated us to determine whether the pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 to TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in vitro would potentiate tumor growth or metastasis in an animal model system.The ability of TNF\u03b1 to potentiate the in vivo aggressiveness of TNBC cells grown with MSCs requires that the in vitro advantages given to the tumor cells by their 3-day exposure to MSCs and to the cytokine, will persist in vivo (the cytokine is removed prior to injection to mice); Thus, we first determined whether the increased pro-metastatic capabilities endowed on the tumor cells by their co-culturing with stromal cells in the presence of TNF\u03b1 withhold when TNF\u03b1 is removed. To this end, TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were established for 67 h with TNF\u03b1 stimulation, leading to high CXCL8 levels and clear changes in tumor cell morphology (Figures 13A,B); then, TNF\u03b1 was removed and the growth of TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures was continued in TNF\u03b1-deprived medium for ~2 weeks. The findings of Figure 13 demonstrate that the effects of TNF\u03b1 were reversible: ~2 weeks after TNF\u03b1 removal the elevation in CXCL8 was completely abolished (Figure 13A) and the elongated cell morphology was almost entirely diminished (Figure 13B).TNF\u03b1 promotes the metastatic potential of TNBC cells grown in contact with MSCs. (A,B) Reversibility of TNF\u03b1-induced tumor-promoting phenotypes, generated in vitro in \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures following TNF\u03b1 removal. mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 67 h (termed \u201c~3 days of TNF\u03b1 stimulation\") (A1,B1). Then, vehicle-treated and TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSCs co-cultures were re-cultured without further TNF\u03b1 stimulation for additional 10\u201314 days (termed \u201c~3 days of stimulation + ~2 weeks W/O TNF\u03b1 stimulation) (A2,B2). At both time points (~3 days and ~2 weeks), extracellular CXCL8 levels were determined in cell supernatants by ELISA (A) and tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy (B). ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant. Bar, 50 \u03bcm. In all panels of section (A,B), the results are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. (C,D) mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, for 67 h (~3 days). Then, co-cultured cells were injected to the mammary fat pad of nude mice in 2 independent experiments (For additional experimental details please see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Total mice numbers were: (1) In the group of mice administered with TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures: n = 12; (2) In the group of mice administered with vehicle-exposed co-cultures: n = 11. At the end of the experiment (~30 days post injection), primary tumor size was determined by volume (C1) and weight (C2). ns=non-significant. (D) Metastases in lungs were detected by mCherry signals using the Cri Maestro fluorescence imaging system. \u2227p = 0.095.Taking into account these findings on reversibility of TNF\u03b1-mediated effects, proposing that the benefits that were provided by TNF\u03b1 stimulation to TNBC:MSC co-cultures may not persist in vivo, we proceeded to the animal system setting. Here, we introduced an experimental design that will enable us to directly assess the impacts of TNF\u03b1 on the metastatic potential of TNBC cells when they interacted with stromal cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 for 67 h, and were compared to vehicle-exposed MDA-MB-231:MSC cultures, serving as controls. The cells were then administered to the mammary fat pads of female mice. To strengthen in vivo the possible effects of TNF\u03b1 when it acted on MDA-MB-231 and MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, CM containing factors released by TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (but deprived of TNF\u03b1 itself) were injected in proximity to tumors generated by TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures; in parallel, control media were administered to tumors arising from injection of vehicle-treated co-cultures. The findings of Figure 13C indicate that the sizes and weights of primary tumors were similar in the two groups of mice; however, most importantly, the metastatic potential of the tumor cells that interacted with MSCs was increased by in-culture TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 13D). This effect was revealed by the elevated incidence of mice carrying lung metastases following MDA-MB-231 co-culturing with MSC under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in vitro, compared to the control group in which the co-cultured cells were not exposed to TNF\u03b1 (Figure 13D).DiscussionThe fundamental roles of the TME in promoting cancer progression are now well-appreciated, with stromal cells and pro-inflammatory elements being key contributors to disease development and metastasis. In the complex milieu that exists in tumors, cross-talks between the different TME players and the tumor cells eventually establish intricate networks whose roles in dictating disease course are still poorly defined and characterized.In the present study, we were particularly interested in elucidating the roles of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks in regulating tumor progression in TNBC, a most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In our study, we have used potent and most clinically relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines - TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 - that are expressed in breast tumors and have pro-metastatic functions in TNBC. Our study provides novel findings indicating that interactions between TNBC cells and MSCs/CAFs in the presence of such pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to significantly enhanced pro-metastatic phenotypes of the TME and of the tumor cells themselves. This was illustrated by increased expression of pro-metastatic chemokines, by elevated ability to induce angiogenesis, as well as by higher migratory and invasive capabilities of the tumor cells. Ultimately, the end result of the activities of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was a higher metastatic potential of TNBC cells in vivo.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network was found in our study to strongly induce the expression of the pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. These chemokines are pro-inflammatory factors and as such contribute to cancer inflammation by recruiting myeloid inflammatory cells, as well as immune-suppressive cells, to tumors and metastases. In addition, of the three chemokines, particularly CXCL8 but also CCL2, are potent angiogenic factors that contribute to TNBC progression. Moreover, direct activities of the chemokines on tumor cells have led to increased invasion in TNBC cells.As part of their pro-metastatic roles in TNBC, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors - for example, CXCR2 for CXCL8 and CCR2 for CCL2 - contributed to the pro-tumorigenic activities of stromal cells in TNBC mouse model systems. MSC/fibroblast-derived chemokines, including murine CXCL1 and CXCL2 (counterparts of human CXCL8), CCL2 and CCL5 were associated with recruitment of neutrophils, tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to TNBC tumors, where they promoted disease course. CXCL8 and CCL5, produced by bone marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs were prime inducers of metastasis in TNBC, acting by elevating the proliferation and invasive properties of the tumor cells, and their resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, MSC-derived CCL2 has attracted macrophages to TNBC tumors, activating them to secrete CXCL8, thus leading to an overall increase in tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells.The above studies strengthen the relevance and importance of our observations on the strong induction of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 when TNBC cells interacted with MSCs/CAFs in the context of pro-inflammatory stimuli, introduced by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. As noted above, both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were found to be responsible for increased aggressiveness in TNBC, and in several studies were connected to increased pro-malignancy functions of MSCs/CAFs. For example, the findings by Shi and colleagues indicated that TNF\u03b1-activated MSCs promoted via CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands the metastatic ability of murine TNBC cells. TNF\u03b1-primed MSCs were also found to reprogram neutrophils to acquire immunosuppressive functions. Other studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-231-derived CM elevated IL-1\u03b2 release by MSCs, increasing their pro-inflammatory nature. In parallel, MSC-derived IL-1\u03b2 increased the proliferation and chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.However, these studies did not address the wider scope of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network, and did not identify the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating TNBC-stroma interactions. Here, our current study provides novel findings, emphasizing the need for both TNBC:MSC cross-talk and pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, in order to achieve the most substantial levels of pro-metastatic activities: high levels of pro-metastatic chemokines, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, our findings suggest that previous studies on TNF\u03b1-treated MSCs that induced anti-tumor activities in TNBC tumors may have overlooked the actual setting that takes place in vivo, when TNBC cells interact with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation.Of major importance in this context is the fact that CXCL8 was revealed in our current study as a key player in mediating the pro-metastatic functional effects of the inflammation-driven tumor-stroma networks in TNBC: angiogenesis, migration-related morphology of the tumor cells, as well as cancer cell migration and invasion. The effects of CXCL8 down-regulation on these pro-metastatic functions in TNBC was pronounced, and our results suggest that it can probably act in cooperativity with other factors that are produced under these network conditions to promote the aggressiveness of TNBC cells that interacted with stromal cells in the context of the pro-inflammatory TME.Here, it is interesting to note that the tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established by luminal-A cells were less potent or differently active than those generated in TNBC, in all aspects: chemokine production, angiogenesis, and tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. These findings may reflect the fact that TNBC cells and luminal breast tumor cells interact differently with fibroblasts. They also agree well with our TCGA results demonstrating lower expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and of the three chemokines in luminal-A patients compared to basal patients. Ultimately, these findings may provide a partial explanation to the more aggressive clinical course of TNBC tumors compared to luminal-A tumors.Overall, our observations suggest that at the TME of TNBC tumors, which is enriched with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the two pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate tumor-stroma interactions that occur at the tumor site, and that under these conditions the in vivo aggressiveness of the tumor cells is increased. It would be interesting to establish similar systems with murine TNBC cells and investigate the possible effects of similar tumor-stroma-inflammation networks and of specific corresponding mouse chemokines on the immune and inflammatory contextures of mice tumors and metastases. Such systems may also enable further analyses that correlate the extent of stroma cell presence with the extent of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as with patterns of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network identified in our study suggests that inhibiting the activities of TNBC-typical pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 would halt tumor-stroma interactions that stand in the basis of TNBC progression. Indeed, inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are in clinical use in inflammatory diseases and were found to inhibit the aggressiveness phenotype of TNBC cells. Obviously, implementation of inhibitory modalities to these cytokines in the in vivo and even more so in the clinical setting would require improved understanding of the entire context of their activities; for example, the activation and regulatory networks of TNF\u03b1 and its TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors take place at multiple regulatory levels that need improved understanding.These considerations emphasize the relevance of the metastatic chemokines that are elevated due to the activity of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage, particularly CXCL8, to therapy. Inhibitors of the axes of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors are also available, suggesting that treatments of TNBC cancers with combination therapies of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may provide novel treatment options for TNBC patients.Ethics StatementAll procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policies.Author ContributionsYL generated all data, and was extensively engaged in study design and manuscript preparation.

It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

Conclusion The current study identified CAF subtypes based on gene expression profiles and found that CAF subtypes have significantly different overall survival, immune cells, and immunotherapy response rates.1. IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

Cancer tissues consist of various cells include cancer cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, immune cells and various bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. Fibroblasts are the most enriched cells in tumor stroma. The activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the cancer niche build a permissive and supportive microenvironment for tumor development. Fibroblasts play important roles in cancer progression including metabolism, metastasis, proliferation, anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis and chemo-resistance by interaction with cancer cells or other cells. Fibroblasts could affect behaviors of cancer cells by activating signal pathways, microRNAs (miRNAs), and soluble molecules and so on.MiRNAs are a type of non-coding small RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at a posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3\u2032 UTR of its target genes. More and more research focus on the roles of miRNAs in fibroblasts. Fibroblasts secrete a variety of chemokines, growth factors, cytokines, which can be regulated by miRNAs. Down-regulation of miR-149, miR-21, miR-409, miR-26b, miR-205, miR-31 and up-regulation of miR-34b and miR-34c expression could transform resident fibroblasts to carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The reported miRNAs could regulate gene expression in fibroblasts and then control cancer development and progression by regulating cytokines or chemokines. Chemokines are critical signaling mediators, which involve in the communication between the cancer cells and fibroblasts through binding to their receptors. Cell survival, proliferation, stem cell properties, ECM attachment, adhesion, metastasis in tissues or to other organs including proteolysis of the basement membrane, locomotion and colony formation will be changed according to the signals from the CAFs.Our previous screening data showed that miR-29b is one of the significant down-regulated miRNAs in CAFs. Our study is to determine how miR-29b influences chemokine secretion of CAFs and its role in the regulation of proliferation, drug resistance and metastasis of breast cancer cells.RESULTSMiR-29b expression down-regulates in CAFsCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the tissues of breast cancer. \u03b1-SMA is the most common marker of CAFs, and it was significantly up-regulated in CAFs than in NFs using immunofluorescence assay (Figure 1A). The markers of CAFs including MCT1, MCT4, \u03b1-SMA and FSP1 were examined by western blotting. It was found that MCT1, MCT4, \u03b1-SMA and FSP1 protein levels were higher than them in NFs, but CAV-1 was significantly down-regulated in CAFs (Figure 1B). Cell proliferation was assayed for SKBR3 with conditioned medium (CM) from NFs or CAFs treatment by colony formation assay (Figure 1C). The results indicated that CAFs were different from NFs, and CAFs showed the features of the activated fibroblasts. It was also shown that CAFs promoted cell migration of SKBR3 cells (Figure 1D\u20131E).Lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs(A) \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs and NFs by immunofluorescence assay.

MiR-29b is one of the down-regulated miRNA in CAFs (Supplementary Table 1). It was also found that miR-29b including miR-29b-1-5p (miR-29b-1) and miR-29b-2-5p (miR-29b-2) were down-regulated in CAFs compared to NFs (Figure 1F\u20131G). These indicated that miR-29b may play a suppressing role in CAFs.CAFs with miR-29b inhibits breast cancer cellular growthTo further investigate the role of miR-29b in CAFs on breast cancer cells, CAFs cells were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 and their expression increased (Supplementary Figure 1). Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. It was found that miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 could inhibit cell survival in three breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7 and SKBR3 (Figure 2A\u20132B). Next, colony formation assay was used for evaluate cell survival ability. It was shown that miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression in CAFs reduced the number of colonies of breast cancer cells, specially, in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2C\u20132D). Cell cycle, reflecting the cell proliferation, was analyzed by flow cytometry in breast cancer cells after co-culturing CAFs with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression. The result showed that miR-29b-1 and miR-29b-2 could decrease the ratio of G1, G2/M phase and increase S phase in MCF-7 and SKBR3 cells (Figure 2E\u20132F). Breast cancer models were set up using nude mice injected with MCF-7 cells and used to verify the effect of miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 on cell growth in vivo. It was found that MCF-7 cells mixed with CAFs could accelerate tumor growth than MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells mixed with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpressed CAFs attenuated tumor growth (Figure 2G). There was a similar result in breast cancer models using BT474 cells (Figure 2H). These data suggested that CAFs with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression suppressed breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.CAFs enhances breast cancer cellular viability by down-regulation of miR-29b(A-B) CAFs were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 mimics for 24h and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells.

To know whether miR-29b regulates the expression of the predicted targeted cytokines, activated CAFs and Hs578Bst fibroblasts (Hs578BstCM) were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 and the mRNA levels of endogenous cytokines were measured by real time RT-PCR. The results showed that CCL11 and CCL18 mRNA decreased when CAFs and Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-1, and the mRNA levels of CXCL9, CXCL14 and CXCL17 were slightly decreased (Figure 3A). CCL11 and CXCL14 mRNA decreased when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-2, but mRNAs of CCL4L1 and CCL4L2 were not changed significantly (Figure 3B).MiR-29b regulates CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in fibroblasts(A) miR-29b-1 restoration down-regulated CCL11 and CCL18 mRNA in CAFs and Hs578Bst fibroblasts treated with conditioned medium from cancer (Hs578BstCM).

(I) Cells were transfected with miR-29b-1, miR-29b-2 or miR-control for 48 hours, then collected for western blotting. The data were shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *:p<0.05, **: p<0.01.Next, to confirm that CCL11 and CCL18 were the target genes of miR-29b-1 and CCL11 and CXCL14 were the target genes of miR-29b-2, plasmids with 3\u2032 UTR of CCL11, CCL18 and CXCL14 were constructed. CAFs and Hs578BstCM were transfected with CCL11, CCL18 or CXCL14 3\u2032 UTRs and miR-29b, and luciferase activities were assayed. The results showed that the luciferase activities of wide types of CCL11 and CCL18 3\u2032 UTR in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-1 were much lower than miRNA controls (Figure 3C\u20133D). The luciferase activities of wide types of CCL11 and CXCL14 3\u2032 UTR in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-2 were much lower than miRNA controls (Figure 3E\u20133F). CCL11, CCL18 protein levels decreased significantly when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-1(Figure 3G\u20133H). CCL11, CCL14 protein levels decreased significantly when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-2 (Figure 3G\u20133H). CCL11 and CXCL14 protein decreased in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-2 transfection by western blotting (Figure 3I). When miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 was suppressed in MCF-7 cells, CCL11 and CXCL14 were inhibited at mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Figure 4). So, the data clearly indicated that CCL11 and CXCL14 were the direct target genes of miR-29b in CAFs or Hs579BstCM.MiR-29b restoration in CAFs inhibits breast cancer cellular viability and metastasis by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14To further investigate the role of miR-29b in fibroblasts on breast cancer cells, CAFs cells were transfected with miR-29b and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells exposed to CCL11 and CXCL14 (10ng/ml) for 24h. Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. It was found that miR-29b could inhibit breast cancer cell survival and also suppressed cell growth by CCL11 and CXCL14 stimulation (Figure 4A\u20134B). MiR-29b could inhibit breast cancer cell migration via CCL11 or CXCL14 from CAFs (Figure 4C\u20134D). Breast cancer cell invasion ability was also inhibited by miR-29b, which could suppress CCL11 and CXCL14 enhanced invasion (Figure 4E\u20134F). When the cells were transfected miR-29-1 or miR-29-2 inhibitors, cell survival ability and migration were enhanced (Supplementary Figure 5).MiR-29b restoration in CAFs inhibits breast cancer cellular viability and metastasis by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14CAFs were transfected with miR-29b mimics or treated with CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24h and then co-cultured with breast cancer cells.

Here, to know whether there are differences of miR-29b down-regulation on drug resistance of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14. The cell survival rates were examined using colony formation assay. The results indicated that CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 could lead to breast cancer cells growing more slowly than breast cancer cells with CM-CAFs treatment, which had higher survival ability than the parent cells (Figure 5A\u20135B). Cell apoptosis was also examined in the MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 with paclitaxel or CCL11 or CXCL14 treatment for 24 hours. It was shown that MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 showed more apoptosis rates than the cells with CM-CAFs treatment (Figure 5C\u20135D).CAFs with miR-29b down-regulation regulates breast cancer cell drug resistance by targeting CCL11 and CXCL14(A-B) MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and then exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24 hours. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates for two weeks and cell survival ability was evaluated using colony formation assay. (C-D) MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and then exposed to paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14 for 24 hours. Cells were labeled with AnnexinV and apoptosis was assayed by flow cytometry.

We found that p38 was activated in MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs treatment, however, in the CM-CAFs/miR-29b or STAT1 is one of down-stream transcriptional factor of p38 and it was also inhibited in the breast cancer cells with CM-CAFs/miR-29b or CM-CAFs/miR-29b treatment. CM-CAFs/miR-29b treated cells decreased the activated p38 (Figure 6A and 6B). Other down-stream gene such as ELK1 and PAX6 were also changed.MiR-29b down-regulation in CAFs activates p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells(A) p38 and p38 down-stream gene expression in MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 and CCL11 treatment.

The data are shown as means\u00b1s.d. collected from three independent experiments. *: p<0.05, **: p<0.01, and -: no significance.To know whether STAT1 involves in the chemokine expression of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were transfected with STAT1 siRNA or treated with STAT1 inhibitor, CCL11 and CXCL14 were assayed by ELISA. The results showed that inhibition of STAT1 could reduce the levels of CCL11 and CXCL14 (Figure 6C). When the cells were transfected with STAT1 siRNA and treated with CCL11 or CXCL14, cell proliferation enhancement by CCL11 or CXCL14 was inhibited in the cells with STAT1 down-regulation (Figure 6D). The results from MTT assay indicated that inhibition of STAT1 suppressed the cell survival ability significantly in MCF-7 cells.DISCUSSIONAlthough the stromal cells in the tumor environment including fibroblasts are not malignant, their altered gene expression profiles influence the cellular function and signal pathways of stroma cells, tumor cell behaviors by the communication between tumor cells and stroma. Fibroblasts are the most common cell type found in the tumor microenvironment and usually activated to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) due to the signals from the microenvironment, which are responsible for the synthesis of proteins involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as secretion of growth factors that regulate tumor cell proliferation, survival and dissemination. In the present study, we identified that miR-29b was the important molecule for the regulation of chemokines' expression in CAFs.MiRNAs have been implicated in the activation of fibroblasts. There are reports showed that miR-31, miR-148a and others are down-regulated in activated fibroblasts. Previous study showed that miR-29b is down-regulated in prostate cancer and breast cancer. Our study showed that miR-29b was down-regulated in CAFs, when miR-29b was introduced into CAFs, the characteristics of CAFs were like NFs (not shown). MiR-29b acts as a tumor suppressor in most cancer types. Our results supported that miR-29b plays a suppressor role in tumor stroma.There are reports shown that fibroblasts involve in the cross-talk of cancer cells and fibroblasts by secreting CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL6, CXCL12, IL6, CXCL16 and others. In the study, we identified that CCL11 and CXCL14 were the target genes of miR-29b in fibroblasts. When miR-29b expression is downregulated in CAFs or activated fibroblasts, CCL11 and CXCL14 expression were significantly higher than the normal fibroblasts. CCL11 and CXCL14 could secret to the outside of the cells and they mainly exist in the extracellular microenvironment. MiR-29b was shown as a negative regulator of CCL11 and CXCL14, but not other chemokines predicted listing in Figure 2. When the CAFs or activated fibroblasts were transfected with miR-29b mimics, CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in the culture media were suppressed. CCL11 and CXCL14 from the CAFs will exert on breast cancer cell and then promotes cell proliferation and metastasis. Further molecular mechanism exploration indicated CCL11 and CXCL14 could active p38-STAT1 pathway in breast cancer cells. Our findings showed that lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs could promote CCL11 and CXCL14 expression, which activate p38 and then promote cell proliferation and metastasis.The selected significant miRNAs from the CAFs and NFsCAFs/NFs>2 meant that miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in CAFs. CAFs/NFs<0.5 meant that miRNAs were significantly down-regulated in CAFs.\t \tIn a conclusion, as shown in Figure 6E, our study elucidated that lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs could promote cellular viability and metastasis by activating p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells by up-regulation of CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in CAFs. STAT1 could promote CCL11, CXCL14 and CCL2 production and then accelerate cell proliferation. This is a positive feedback process. There need more studies to evaluate the function of other miRNAs aberrantly regulated in CAFs and their network. Revealing the molecular mechanisms involved in CAFs-mediated cancer growth and progression may be beneficial for finding new cancer therapy targets.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and cultureThe breast cancer cell lines were originally purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100\u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Fibroblasts Hs578Bst were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Hybri-Care Medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) with 30 ng/ml EGF, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100\u03bcg/mL streptomycin. All the cell lines were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Isolation and culture of cancer-associated fibroblastsCarcinoma associated fibroblasts were isolated referred to the previously reports from five breast cancer tissues, which were diagnosed with mammary ductal carcinoma. The experiment was obtained the agreement from the Institutional Review Board of our hospital.

The tissues were cutted into about 2 mm fragments and then digested overnight at 37\u00b0C with 0.1% collagenase III (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) in DMEM and 10% FBS. The following day, the epithelial cells were separated by centrifuge. The stromal cells were washed in PBS and cultured. All experiments were performed before the 10th passage. In addition, normal fibroblasts (2cm from breast cancer tissues) were isolated according to the CAFs isolation.Co-culturing of breast cancer cells and fibroblasts and conditioned medium preparationCAFs and NFs were co-cultured with breast cancer cells with the ratio at 1:1. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 media with 10% FBS supplemented with 10% FBS in a 37\u00b0C humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air for 24 hours, and then washed for three times with PBS and finally cultured in 3ml serum free DMEM/F12 media for 2 hours.

The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford Coomassie blue method (Pierce Chemical Corp.). Whole-cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with various primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase\u2013labeled secondary antibodies. The signals were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Promega).ShRNA lentivirus vector constructionShRNA lentiviral particle delivery system was used to generate STAT1 siRNA, and STAT1-silenced tumor cell lines were done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The lentiviral particles were purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). After selection under puromycin (1\u03bcg/ml), the knocking down effect in the drug resistant cells was evaluated by western blot.Cell proliferation assayCells were cultured in 24-well plates with low-glucose (1g/L), low-serum (0.5% FBS) medium (0.5 mL/well) at 37\u00b0C. Following the indicated treatments, 10 mg/mL methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added (50 \u03bcL/well), and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 hours. The cells were then lysed with a lysis buffer (500\u03bcL/well) containing 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in dimethyl formamide/H2O (1:1, v/v; pH 4.7) at 37\u00b0C for at least 6 hours. The relative number of surviving cells in each group was determined by measuring the optical density (OD) of the cell lysates at an absorbance wavelength of 570 nm.Cell colony formationThe cells were harvested, sparsely plated, and were cultured under the normal condition. The medium underwent the replacement at three-day intervals. And then the cells were fixed in 90% ethanol, stained with crystal violet and colonies consisting of at least 50 cells so they were counted ten days later.Cell cycleIn 2ml culture medium 2\u00d7105 cells/well (6-well plate) were seeded, and cultured for the indicated time before collection.

In addition to its role in cell cycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytoskeleton. The role of p21 in breast cancer development and progression has not been fully investigated. While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does not fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor. Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not common in human cancers. Furthermore, in vivo studies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of p21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells to undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these animals developed normally. Intriguingly, p21 is often overexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix. Together these observations suggest that the role played by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially thought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle regulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in promoting carcinogenesis.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in the metastatic process and are regulated by numerous tumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microenvironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell migration and invasion. Among these tumor-secreted factors, TGF\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting tumor metastasis. The TGF\u03b2 family regulates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination during embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on reproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth, bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout adult life. The effects of TGF\u03b2 in breast cancer are complex. TGF\u03b2 is thought to play a dual role in breast cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in normal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in aggressive carcinoma. The growth inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2 are known to be mediated through transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene and induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1 arrest. During tumor progression, however, the loss of TGF\u03b2 growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to defects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGF\u03b2. Meanwhile, other TGF\u03b2 responses prevail, unrelated to growth inhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 induces degradation of the ECM, inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete increasing quantities of TGF\u03b2, which in turn alter the stroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosuppression, thus further contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Together these studies highlight an important role for TGF\u03b2 in advanced breast cancer. However, the function for p21 downstream of TGF\u03b2 has not been described in breast cancer.In this study, we found that high p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The expression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo. Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like triple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to physically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyltransferase p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2 and identified p21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also showed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21 and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carcinomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF as critical regulators of cell migration and invasion downstream of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast cancer.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25 cells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9) and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

For stable cell line generation, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and pools of stable cells were selected with 10 ng/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). SUM159PT cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs in the absence of insulin and hydrocortisone before TGF\u03b21 stimulation.Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitationCells were lysed in cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin hydrochloride, 10 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin and 10 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Protein content was measured using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal protein was analyzed by Western blot using mouse anti-p21 (F5), mouse anti-c-myc, mouse anti-p15, rabbit anti-Smad2/3 (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-cofilin and cofilin antibodies (1:1,000 dilution, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and followed by secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse or rabbit. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4\u00b0C using antibodies against p300/CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (Abcam\u00ae, Cambridge, MA, USA) and p21. Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was added for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C, and washed four times with cold lysis buffer. The immunocomplexes were boiled with 2\u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting.Histone proteins extractionTotal histone proteins were extracted as previously described. Briefly, 80% confluent of SCP2 cells from a 100-mm tissue culture plate were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 or 1 \u00b5M trichostatin A (TSA). SCP2 cells were harvested and resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors, 1 \u00b5M TSA and 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cell lysates were rotated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 minutes. The supernatants were discarded and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 400 \u00b5l of 0.4 N H2SO4 and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and supernatants containing histones were transferred into a fresh tube. A total of 132 \u00b5l trichloroacetic acid was added drop by drop to the histone solution, inverted several times and then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The histone precipitates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone and the histone pellets were air dried for 20 minutes. Total histone proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an acetylated lysine antibody (Millipore).DNA affinity precipitation assaySCP2 cells transiently transfected with the indicated siRNAs were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes.

A total of 500 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides (IDT) was added and incubated with cell lysates for two hours at 4\u00b0C. Streptavidin-agarose beads (65 \u00b5l; Sigma) were added, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and then washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The streptavidin-agarose beads containing biotinylated oligonucleotides and protein complex were boiled with 2\u00d7 SDS Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting. The sequences of biotin labeled double-strand oligonucleotides (IDT) were previously described.

Transfected cells were then stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured (EG & G Berthold luminometer, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity.Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of total RNA using random primers was carried out using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCRs were carried out using SsoFast\u2122EvaGreen\u00ae Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI Lab Equipment, Montreal Biotech Inc. Kirkland, PQ, Canada). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 20 s).

After two days, 25 \u00b5l 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for two hours. A total of 200 \u00b5l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well and mixed well. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a plate reader.Cell cycle analysisSCP2 cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 0, 2, 6 and 24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml RNase (Sigma), and stained with 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA content was determined using a FACScan flow cytometry analyzer.Kinetic cell migration assayCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in Essen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of ImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of the wound are automatically taken at the exact same location by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cells were then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell layers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to generate approximately 800 \u00b5m width wounds. After wounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and stimulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of TGF\u03b2. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into IncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for 24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence or relative wound density automatically measured by the IncuCyte software.Matrigel invasion assayFor the Transwell assays, 30 \u00b5l of growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled H2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell invasion plate (8-\u00b5m pore size; BD Biosciences) and incubated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2 or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded on Transwell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the upper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers contained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT cells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM'S medium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded through GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were photographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscope and total cell numbers were counted and quantified by Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated with anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one hour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00ae Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysisTissue sections (5 \u00b5m) from breast carcinoma microarray slides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1 (Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry staining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam), phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detection of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were then counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. All images were scanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a pathologist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was scored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25% tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells stained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moderately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21 were examined by the Pearson correlation test using SPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations between these protein expressions and lymph node status were assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-value (two-sided) <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Mammary fat pad and intratibia injections of nude miceFour- to six-week old female Balb/c nude mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as a model for primary mammary tumor formation and local invasion. The animal study was approved by the ethics committee and all the experimental animal protocols were in accordance with the McGill University Animal Care. Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7 105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) with a 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size was measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume was determined according to the formula: tumor volume = shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice (eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injection to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the end of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding fat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u00b5m thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the tumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left tibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography of the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the osteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no lesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant lesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone surface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break in peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).Statistical analysesStudent's t-test was used and differences between groups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.Resultsp21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patientsPrevious studies have suggested that higher expression of cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. To further explore the correlation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently published gene profiling database of breast cancer patients to assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the median, upper and lower quartile expression levels of p21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and DMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left panels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated with poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7; 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to 3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17; 0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels showed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P = 0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20 years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metastasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a better survival rate. Although the prediction did not show statistically significant results in the median expression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR, 1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical significance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the relationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in patients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot rule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in the stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these data demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated p21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor progression.High p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. A-C, The relationship of higher p21 expression and breast cancer outcome was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The survival rates were analyzed using three different and separate splits of the patients, based on p21 expression levels (A, median; B, upper quartile; C, lower quartile). For each split, the patients were then divided into high and low groups with respect to p21 expression. Overall survival (left panels) and distant metastasis-free survival (right panels) correlate with p21 gene expression. Number of breast cancer patients at risk with higher expression (red) and lower expression (black) of p21 at the indicated time points.Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro To investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation and progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-metastatic cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to as MDA) cells. We first assessed the effect of suppressing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably transfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells. Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21 protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells (Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in the rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size between animals injected with parental or p21-deficient cells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in tumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21 depletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for early tumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with the overlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed by a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by determining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the surrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tissue), as previously described. As shown in Figure 2C (left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group displayed no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and were deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast, tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor mass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure 2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an important role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed in vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited both cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E, respectively).Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion. A, Total lysates from parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for the protein levels of p21 and \u03b2-tubulin. B, Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were injected into the mammary glands of four- to six-week-old female Balb/c nude mice. The size of mammary tumor was measured from two sets of mice (eight per group; error bars indicate SEM). C, Representative photographs show hematoxylin and eosin staining of the mammary gland (tumor and fat pad) of 12- to 15-month-old mice. D and E, Transwell cell migration (left panel) and GFR-Matrigel invasion assay (right panel) of parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were performed. Graphs show total migrated and invaded cell number counted by Image J (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare parental vs. shRNA p21 SCP2 groups. Differences were considered significant at *P < 0.05.As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the animals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells (eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat pad developed any bone lesions after two months, the date at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor size. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor cells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the later stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its involvement in the development of bone osteolytic lesions using an intratibia injection model of parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice. By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experimental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell metastasis and survival in the bone marrow. As shown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following X-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice developed secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to acquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to the earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cellsp21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling pathways. Among these and of particular interest is the TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, we examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on the expression levels of p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarcinoma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25), an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter referred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with anaplastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carcinoma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived SUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from metastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal carcinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315). As shown in Figure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGF\u03b2 strongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these cell lines. Interestingly, TGF\u03b2 showed no regulatory effect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regulatory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent with a loss of the TGF\u03b2 growth inhibitory responses in these cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor, the TGF\u03b2-induced increases in p21 protein levels did not translate into growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in these breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investigated the mechanisms by which TGF\u03b2 regulates p21 protein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGF\u03b2-induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGF\u03b2 regulation of p21 expression is mediated through the TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found this effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as TGF\u03b2 induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to induce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of Smad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these data indicate that TGF\u03b2 potently induces p21 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell growth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-type breast cancer cells.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cells. A, Real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA level of p21 gene (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments) for the indicated cell lines. B, Cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. C, Total cell lysates were analyzed for c-myc, p15 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. D, SCP25 cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5M TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor (SB431542) or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 minutes and then stimulated with TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. E, MDA cells were transfected with 40 nM Scrambled (Scr), Smad2 or Smad3 siRNAs in response to TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for Smad2/3, p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migrationTGF\u03b2 is an important modulator of cell motility in breast cancer. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could act downstream of TGF\u03b2 to promote cell migration. We first examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122). Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A, B, TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2 and SUM149. As a negative control, we also used SUM1315 in which TGF\u03b2 did not regulate p21 expression. As expected, there was no effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migration. A, Representative images of phase contrast and wound mask of indicated cell lines stimulated with TGF\u03b2 in scratch/wound healing assay. The initial wound mask (black) and wound closure (grey) were measured using the Essen Instruments Scratch Wound Module. B, The time course of cell migration for the indicated cell lines was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNAs and then stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin by Western blotting. D, Representative images of phase contrast (top panels) and wound mask (bottom panels) of transfected SCP2 cells with the indicated siRNAs in scratch/wound healing assay. E, The time course of transfected SCP2 cell migration was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression using two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics by the scratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C, TGF\u03b2 induced p21 expression in both mock and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected cells, while this effect was blocked in cells transfected with either p21 siRNAs, confirming the specificity and efficacy of our p21 siRNAs. Importantly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in mock and Scr siRNA transfected SCP2 cells, this effect was completely blocked in cells in which p21 expression was depleted (Figure 4D, E). The effect of p21 siRNAs on TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration was similar to that observed when cells were transfected with a siRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control (Figure 4D, E). We also confirmed that these effects on cell migration were not secondary to changes in cell growth, as silencing of p21 expression had no effect on cell growth and proliferation (Figure S4C). These results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration of human breast cancer cells is dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasionTo examine the role of p21 in TGF\u03b2-induced tumor cell invasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr siRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive potential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel Transwell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and Scr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGF\u03b2 significantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and this effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect of the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the p21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells in which endogenous p21 expression was silenced were transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA (Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21 overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level (Figure 5C) as well as TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion through the GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect is specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limitation of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the pro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing or blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not alter their growth in response to TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found SUM159 to be highly responsive to TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpression of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was observed in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells are dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGF\u03b2 signaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum and EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure S6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory role in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the strong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell invasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasion. A, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2. GFR-Matrigel coated Transwell invasion assay was performed and images of the invading cells were photographed. B, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with a Scr or p21 siRNA as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA in the presence or the absence of TGF\u03b2. p21 protein levels were then analyzed by Western blotting. D, Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. The number of invaded cells was counted by Image J (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). E, Cell invasion of transfected SUM159 was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. F, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments).p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity and downstream genes involved in cell invasionIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regulates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting ROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migration in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells in response to TGF\u03b2. As shown in Figure S7A (Additional file 8), TGF\u03b2 has no effect on the phosphorylation of cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate cofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under the stimulation of TGF\u03b2. Treatment with TGF\u03b2 caused accumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGF\u03b2-induced and p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell cycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact with multiple transcription factors to selectively inhibit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in distinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair, survival and ECM components. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could interact with the Smad proteins to regulate the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effects. Smad/p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in Figure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced association between Smad2 and p21, we found TGF\u03b2 to clearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and p21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the p21/Smad3 interaction on TGF\u03b2 signaling, we then examined the effect of p21 on TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking down p21 did not affect TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. However, using a TGF\u03b2/Smad transcriptional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad transcriptional activity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silencing abolished TGF\u03b2-induced luciferase activity of the Smad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc activity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overexpressing p21 in response to TGF\u03b2. These results indicate that TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between p21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the earlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphorylation), it is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated Smad transcriptional activity.p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity. A, HEK293 and SCP2 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. Transfected cells were stimulated TGF\u03b2 for 8 hrs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and p21 antibodies. B, Transfected MDA cells were immunoblotting by phospho-Smad3 (p-Smad3), Smad2/3 and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies in response to TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. C, SCP2 cells were co-transfected with either mock, Scr siRNA, p21 siRNA or flag-tagged p21 construct (p21 cDNA) and SBE promoter construct (CAGA12-luc). Transfected cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). D and E, SUM159 and SCP2 cells were treated with or without TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).We next performed gene profiling experiments in parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently transfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21 shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum of two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes, among which were selected those known to be associated with the tumor metastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate target genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), plasminogen activator (PLAU) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9). To confirm that these genes were TGF\u03b2 downstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 and mRNA levels for these target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGF\u03b2 significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2, PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines.To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional regulation of these genes by TGF\u03b2, we examined the effects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing p21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2 to induce expression of these target genes. The same results were obtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not shown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these cell lines potentiated the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional effects on these target genes. As a negative control and to ensure specificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of silencing p21 on the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA. TGF\u03b2 regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21 (Figure 7B).p21 regulates TGF\u03b2-induced downstream genes involved in cell invasion. A, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNA as well as p21 cDNA. Cells were then treated with or without TGF\u03b2 and the mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). B, SUM159 cells transfected with Scr siRNA and p21 siRNA were treated with TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA level of TGFBI gene was measured by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. D, Total cell number was counted by Image J and number of invaded cells was quantified (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To address the contribution of these identified p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their gene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Figure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While depletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antagonized the TGF\u03b2 response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8 showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examination of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated that IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggesting that they may be specifically required for the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of MMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion suggesting that these target genes have a broader effect on cell invasion, not limited to the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Together, these results indicate that even though all five genes are important for TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to cell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predominant roles.p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 DNA bindingp21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcription by associating with various transcription factors, but also regulates estrogen receptor-\u03b1-dependent gene expression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP). Gene transcription downstream of TGF\u03b2 signaling is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member of another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-acetyl transferases. Thus, we examined whether p21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2. Interestingly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce association between p21 and p300/CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21 and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer cells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 occupancy on SBE. A, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were treated with TGF\u03b2. Cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, as indicated. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA. Transfected cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for eight hours. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and flag antibodies. C and D, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p/CAF siRNAs as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA, treated with or without TGF\u03b2. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). E, SCP2 cells transfected with Scr and p/CAF siRNA were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2. Cell invasion was quantified by relative TGF\u03b2 fold induction (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). F, Transfected SCP2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting p/CAF and \u03b2-tubulin. G, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad3, myc-Smad2 and p/CAF. Immunoprecipitated Smad2/3 using an anti-myc antibody was subjected to Western blotting. H, DNA precipitation (DNA IP) was performed using biotinylated control and 4\u00d7 CAGA SBE oligonucleotides, following by streptavidin precipitation. Western blotting of Smad3 and p/CAF is shown. I, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 or p/CAF siRNAs. Samples were subjected to DNA IP and immunoblotting of Smad3. J, Transfected SCP2 cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicated SEM; n =3 independent experiments).A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds to Smad3. As we have shown that TGF\u03b2 induces complex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also required for Smad3 association with p21. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to block expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in Figure 8B, TGF\u03b2 induced complex formation between p21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly, depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interaction, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for Smad3 interaction with p21.To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regulation of p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 downstream target genes, SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged p21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF siRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to verify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR (Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction of IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGF\u03b2. However, these effects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene expression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required for p21-dependent gene expression of the TGF\u03b2 targets (Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of TGF\u03b2 was further investigated using the Transwell Matrigel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF gene expression significantly impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western blotting (Figure 8F).Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene transcription by acetylating histones and transcription factors, we then assessed whether TGF\u03b2 could induce global changes in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For this, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells, treated or not with TGF\u03b2 and subjected to immunoblotting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Figure S8 (Additional file 9), TGF\u03b2 had no effect on global histone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels. This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF recruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more directed towards acetylation of specific targets rather than global histone modifications. To address this, we examined whether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads. Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interacting with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acetylation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the acetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not show any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not shown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be required for its DNA binding activity. Thus, this led us to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with DNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA IP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad binding element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the Figure 8H, we found TGF\u03b2 to specifically induce binding of both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we found that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siRNAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I), suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we then assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on Smad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc reporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results clearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity.Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF, further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Furthermore, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity, highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGF\u03b2 target gene transcription.High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated with lymph node positivityLymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes. High expression of TGF\u03b21 is correlated with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis. To examine the association among active TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immunohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of serine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21 and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF protein expression in tumor cells was graded and described in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2 as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of 3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As shown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients showed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expressions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3 (68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P = 0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish between tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic cells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Additional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher level in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We also examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels and p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels, using the Pearson's correlation test. As shown in Figure 9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phosphorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly correlate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data indicate that active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling is associated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression levels and significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.High expression of p/CAF/p21/pSmad3 is associated with lymph node positivity. A, Representative immunohistochemistry images of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF in breast cancer tissue microarray samples. B, Overall pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF immunohistochemistry staining intensity between lymph node negative (LN-) and positive (LN+) tissues. C, Percentage of case distribution according to immunoreactivity of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF in tumor cells, the score for negative (0), low (1 to 2) and high (3 to 4).DiscussionWhile p21 was initially characterized as an important cell cycle inhibitor, recent studies suggest that cytoplasmic p21 has anti-apoptotic and actin cytoskeleton regulatory functions. The accumulation of cytoplasmic p21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated tumorigenic transformation. Moreover, overexpression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of many types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in breast cancer has not been established. In our study, we assessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad transplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells in mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expression did not affect the primary tumor formation, it potently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into surrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evidence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary tumor local invasion.Previous studies have indicated that during breast cancer progression, TGF\u03b2 cytostatic responses are lost while pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell lines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 and that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce any change in p15 or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21 expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21 functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is in contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, where TGF\u03b2-mediated p21 gene expression leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we found that the induction of p21 in invasive breast cancer cells is required for the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of TGF\u03b2. In accordance with these results, depletion of p21 did not modulate primary tumor growth in vivo but strongly blocked tumor invasion capacity. These findings together support the notion of a direct oncogenic role for p21 in breast cancer progression.We further report that the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 specific. This is interesting in light of previous reports indicating that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and that Smad3, but not Smad2, promotes breast cancer metastasis in mice. Furthermore, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been described, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet been reported. Together these data suggest that in breast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are mediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove useful to improve the clinical course of metastatic patients.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; however, we found that TGF\u03b2 had no effect on regulating cofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we identified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regulation of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling through the interaction of p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The interaction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-dependent, but whether this interaction is direct will require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on cell migration and invasion are mediated through interactions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interesting to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF\u03b2 or whether it is also required for the transcriptional regulation of other types of TGF\u03b2 responses and target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast cancer cells (Figure 10).Model of pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. The role of p21 as both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of p/CAF/Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in triple negative breast cancer cells.Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGF\u03b2-mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The prognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clinical and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic parameters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a sharp difference in survival rate between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we found a significant association of active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node positivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers for lymph node metastasis.ConclusionIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High expression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall and distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream regulator of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and the acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results highlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGF\u03b2-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level.AbbreviationsBSA: bovine serum albumin; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMFS: distant metastasis free survival; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; p15: p15Ink4b; EGF: epidermal growth factor; ER: estrogen receptor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFR: growth factor reduced; IL6: interleukin 6; MMP9: matrix metalloproteinase 9; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; OS: overall survival; p21: p21Cip1; p/CAF: p300/CBP-associated factor; PLAU: plasminogen activator; PTGS2: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulphate; T\u03b2RI: TGF\u03b2 type I receptor; TGF\u03b2: transforming growth factor-beta; TSA: trichostatin ACompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMD and JJL designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+.

Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

        "content": "In the tumor microenvironment, Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) become activated by cancer cells and increase their secretory activity to produce soluble factors that contribute to tumor cells proliferation, invasion and dissemination to distant organs. The pro-tumorigenic transcription factor STAT3 and its canonical inducer, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, act conjunctly in a positive feedback loop that maintains high levels of IL-6 secretion and STAT3 activation in both tumor and stromal cells. Here, we demonstrate that STAT3 is essential for the pro-tumorigenic functions of murine breast cancer CAFs both in vitro and in vivo, and identify a STAT3 signature significantly enriched for genes encoding for secreted proteins. Among these, ANGPTL4, MMP13 and STC-1 were functionally validated as STAT3-dependent mediators of CAF pro-tumorigenic functions by different approaches. Both in vitro and in vivo CAFs activities were moreover impaired by MMP13 inhibition, supporting the feasibility of a therapeutic approach based on inhibiting STAT3-induced CAF-secreted proteins. The clinical potential of such an approach is supported by the observation that an equivalent CAF-STAT3 signature in humans is expressed at high levels in breast cancer stromal cells and characterizes patients with a shorter disease specific survival, including those with basal-like disease.",

        "content": "The biological heterogeneity of breast cancer leads to the need for finding new approaches to understand the mechanisms implicated in breast cancer progression. The tumor stroma appears as a key in the progression of solid tumors towards a malignant phenotype. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may orchestrate a functional \"corrupted\" stroma which in turn helps metastatic spread. In this study, we investigated by real-time PCR, the expression of 19 factors by normal breast-associated fibroblasts (NAFs) and CAFs, which were implicated in several actions promoting tumor growth, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation and invasion. Also, we explored the influence of inflammatory cells phenotypes (MMP11 status) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) on the molecular profile of CAFs. If we consider that one of the major sources of CAFs are resident NAFs, the transition of NAFs into CAFs is associated with molecular changes involving the overexpression of some molecular factors of biological importance in tumor progression. In addition, the characterization of the tumor stroma regarding to the MMP11 status by MICs reflects a type of fibroblasts which contribute even more to tumor progression. Moreover, different patterns in the induction of the expression of factors by CAFs were observed, depending on the tumor cell line which they were co-cultured with. Furthermore, CAFs influence TGF\u03b2 expression in both cancer cell lines. Therefore, this study can help to a better characterization of tumor stroma in order to improve the prognostic evaluation, as well as to define the different populations of CAFs as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "content": "Tumor initiation and progression are not only ascribed to the behavior of cancer cells, but also profoundly influenced by the tumor microenvironment. Inside, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have become key factors to accelerate growth and metastasis for the abundance in most solid tumors. Our group previously reported that Oroxylin A (OA), a flavone from Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi, possess the ability to suppress growth and invasion of several tumor cells. However, the regulatory effect of OA on stromal microenvironment is poorly understood. In this study, breast cancer-induced fibroblasts and primary breast CAFs from MMTV-PyMT mice were used to evaluate the influence of OA on the activation of fibroblasts. Results showed that OA could decrease the expression of \u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Thus, OA-deactivated CAFs did not further promote the proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. In vivo experiments, OA could also impede tumor metastasis through exhausting progressive CAFs. Mechanically, OA could specifically bind ACTN1 and significantly inhibit its expression to prevent CAF activation. As a consequence, OA could decrease the phosphorylation of FAK and STAT3, and reduce the secretion of CCL2 in CAFs. Altogether, OA could remodel stromal microenvironment and it is a potential therapeutic agent in breast cancer.",

Journal of Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.IntroductionCarcinomas are composed of neoplastic cells admixed with many types of supportive cells, which constitute the tumour stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant cell type within cancer stroma, play significant roles in overall breast cancer development and spread. Genetic and epigenetic changes activate stromal fibroblasts, which then escort cancer cells throughout the whole carcinogenic process in a paracrine manner. Indeed, activated fibroblasts secrete high levels of various growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases such as the MMPs, which are used to communicate with cancer cells as well as with other stromal cells. CAFs exhibit some important features of neoplastic cells and have been shown to promote carcinogenesis both in vitro and in animal models. High numbers of active stromal fibroblasts are often associated with high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis. Furthermore, CAFs were shown to play major roles in drug resistance and tumour recurrence.Surgery is considered the first line of treatment for most breast tumours. During lumpectomy, the tumour is removed with some normal surrounding tissues (surgical margins) to ensure the removal of all tumour cells and to minimize local recurrence. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that surgical margin status influences the risk of local recurrence. Recurrences arise most frequently in the tumour bed. Thereby, radiotherapy is usually applied as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of relapse. Furthermore, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) was also used and yielded very low recurrence rates when given as a boost. Importantly, TARGIT impaired the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding. This may be due to the immediate effect of radiation on the local tumour microenvironment, making it less favourable for tumour growth and progression. This suggests that cancer may recur following breast conserving surgery due to residual unresected tumour or to the presence of active stromal cells, or both. In fact, even in tumour-free tissues, the microenvironment could still play a capital role in tumour development/recurrence. Indeed, it has been recently shown that breast cancers with higher mean stiffness values at shear-wave elastography, which is related to the surrounding stroma rather than to the cancer itself, had poorer prognostic features. Therefore, we sought to undergo molecular and cellular characterization of breast stromal fibroblasts from negative surgical margins. We show that these cells exhibit a specific gene expression profile and are procarcinogenic.Materials and methodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblasts were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients under Research Ethical Committee Project No. RAC#2031091. CAFs were derived from tumour areas of the samples, while TCFs were developed from histologically normal tissues located at least 2 cm away from tumours (invasive ductal carcinomas). Processing of tissues was performed after routine examination by a certified anatomical pathologist, using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Normal fibroblasts (NBFs) and epithelial cells (NLECs) were derived from healthy age-matched females who underwent breast reduction surgery. In the present experiments, NBFs, CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, under the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). NLEC cells were cultured in universal medium [1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10\u20138 m choleratoxin, 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium), 0.4 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone, 2 \u00d7 10\u20139 m T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and 5 mg/ml oestrogen, and were used at passage 2. MCF-7 and MCF-10 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), except for antibiotic/antimycotics and ITS, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cells cultured in medium with serum, whilst serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was obtained from cells cultured in the absence of serum. In both cases, the cells were cultured for 24 h before the media were collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.Affymetrix exon array and data analysis; quantitative RT\u2013PCRExon array protocols are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. Quantitative RT\u2013PCR was conducted as described previously. All reactions were performed in triplicate and the data analysed using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. The respective primers are presented in Supplementary materials and methods.Cell proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with SFCM and incubated for different time intervals (0, 24 and 48 h). Cell proliferation was measured by the tetrazolium salt colorimetric assay, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) after incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The amount of formazan was quantified at 450 nm.Immunoblotting, cytokine array and ELISAImmunoblotting of total cell protein lysates was performed as previously described. Antibodies are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. SFCMs from CAF, TCF and NBF cells were applied to a RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody array (RayBiotech Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems; or RayBiotech for MMP-2). These experiments were performed in triplicate.Chemotaxis and invasion assayInvasion chambers (24-well) were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines (BD Bioscience); 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells were added to the upper wells, separated by an 8 \u00b5m pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with Diff Quick (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane, using Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using a light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification \u00d740). Each assay was performed in triplicate.Orthotopic tumour xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH & RC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Fifteen female nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper, using the formula: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsSurgical margin stromal fibroblasts exhibit a specific gene expression profileTo identify the molecular changes that can take place in breast stromal fibroblasts from surgical margins, gene expression profiles of five paired CAFs/TCFs as well as three NBFs were examined. Total RNA was extracted and genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed, using Affymetrix's GeneChip\u00ae Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (HE 1.0 STAs). Three different comparisons were performed: TCFs with CAFs; TCFs with NBFs; and CAFs with NBFs. p < 0.05 and a threshold of absolute fold change \u2264 2 \u2265 was considered a significant difference in the analysis of the microarray data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed 804 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TCF, CAF and NBF cells. The unsupervised two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical clustering revealed a clear pattern of gene expression, defining three main transcriptome clusters corresponding to TCFs, CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A).Differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Total RNA from five CAFs, their corresponding TCFs as well as three NBFs was used to perform genome-wide gene expression analysis. (A) Unsupervised 2D hierarchical clustering of significantly varying genes across the three groups was performed using Pearson's correlation with average linkage clustering (only the top 112 of the most significantly dysregulated genes are shown for readability). (B) The three dominant PCA components that contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix clearly distinguished samples as CAF, TCF and NBF. (C) Venn diagram showing differential gene expression between the groups. (D) qRT\u2013PCR data for the indicated genes (mean \u00b1 SD)Unsupervised principle components analysis (PCA), which contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix, further showed the presence of three distinct groups (Figure 1B). Intriguingly, the TCF samples clustered closer to CAF cells than to NBFs. Moreover, the gene expression variability was highest for the TCF group (Figure 1B). Next, Venn diagram analysis was performed, with the significance of overlaps calculated using hypergeometric distributional assumption and p values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This comparison approach revealed a significant overlap between TCFs and CAFs as compared to the two other comparisons (p < 10\u20135) (Figure 1C). Indeed, among the three comparisons, the least number of DEGs was between CAFs versus TCFs, with only 42 DEGs (Figure 1C). On the other hand, the number of DEGs between CAFs and NBFs reached 101 (Figure 1C). Comparing TCF with NBF, we found 77 DEGs, 25 of which were also differentially expressed between CAFs and NBFs, while the levels of 49 genes were uniquely dysregulated in TCFs as compared to NBFs and CAFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that TCF cells present in surgical margins exhibit specific gene expression patterns relative to their corresponding CAFs and also normal breast fibroblasts.Quantitative RT\u2013PCR validation of gene expression resultsTo validate the RNA microarray analysis, we performed quantitative RT\u2013PCR on nine genes: MMP-3, ITGB8, SFRP4, ITGBP7, ADAMTS1, CTGF, PTGS, SDHC and CCL-2. Figure 1D shows differential expression of all these genes between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. These results confirm the presence of differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokinesNext, we assessed the level of secreted pro-carcinogenic cytokines from CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Therefore, CAF-114, TCF-114 and NBF-6 were cultured to 80% confluency and then complete medium (CpM) was replaced with serum-free medium (SFM). Serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was collected after 48 h of incubation and applied to the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody array map. The array showed differential levels of various cytokines between TCF, CAF and NBF cells (Figure 2A). Upon quantification and normalization against the positive controls probed on the membrane, it was clear that CAFs secreted the highest levels of the majority of these cytokines (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the levels of SDF-1, CCL-25, TIMP-1 and TNF-alfa were also higher in TCF-114 cells than in NBF cells (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained when comparing CAF-180, TCF-180 and NBF-1 (data not shown). This shows that TCFs, although present in histologically normal parts of the breast, secrete high levels of various pro-carcinogenic cytokines.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokines. SFCMs from the indicated cells were collected and applied on the human cytokine antibody array map. (A) Cytokine array maps highlighting the differentially expressed cytokines. (B) Quantification of the array data for selected cytokines. (C) SFCMs were used to assess the levels of the indicated proteins by ELISA in CAF/TCF pairs from three patients compared to NBF-6 (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005)TCFs secrete high levels of SDF-1, VEGF-A and IL-6To further show the variation in cytokine secretion, SFCMs were collected from three different CAFs and their corresponding TCFs (87, 180 and 142) and NBF-6, and were used to assess the levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A by ELISA. Figure 2C shows that CAF cells secreted the highest levels of the three cytokines. Interestingly, the secreted levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A were also higher in all TCFs compared to NBF-6 (8.2-, 4.2- and 25-fold higher, respectively) (Figure 2C). Figure 2C also shows inter-patient variation in the secreted levels of these important pro-carcinogenic factors. These results confirm that TCF cells secrete higher levels of pro-carcinogenic factors relative to normal breast fibroblasts.TCF cells from surgical margins exhibit features of active fibroblastsTo test whether fibroblasts from surgical margins display features of activation, we examined the levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 (two major markers of active breast fibroblasts) by immunoblotting. Interestingly, like CAF cells, TCFs also express higher levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 than NBF-6 and NBF-1 (Figure 3A). However, while the level of \u03b1-SMA was similar in TCFs and their corresponding CAFs, SDF-1 levels were slightly higher in CAF cells as compared to their respective TCFs (Figure 3A). Next, we studied the migratory and invasiveness abilities of TCF cells, using chambers either coated with Matrigel (invasion) or uncoated (migration). While CpM was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers, cells (4 \u00d7 105) were added to the upper wells in serum-free medium for 24 h. Figure 3B shows that while NBF-1 and NBF-6 cells were unable to migrate, TCF-87 and TCF-180 cells showed invasiveness and migratory abilities. However, the number of invading and migrating TCF cells was lower than that of their corresponding CAF cells (Figure 3B). This provides further evidence that TCF cells display active fibroblast features.TCFs are active fibroblasts. (A) Immunoblotting for \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 of the indicated cell lysates. (B) Invasion/migration assays. The numbers of invaded/migrated cells are presented in the histogram (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005 for TCFs compared to NBF-1 and NBF-6; note that CAFs are also significantly different)Surgical margin fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of non-cancerous epithelial cellsTo further show the active state of TCF cells, we studied their paracrine effect on the proliferation of epithelial cells. SFCMs collected from CAF/TCF-142, -180, -87 and \u2212114 pairs and from NBF-6 and NBF-1 were used for culturing non-cancerous MCF10A epithelial cells. Proliferation of MCF10A cells was higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF and TCF cells, compared to NBF cells. TCFs showed an intermediate effect between CAFs and NBFs (Figure 4). Indeed, after 24 h of incubation, SFCMs from TCF-87 and CAF-87 enhanced cell proliferation two- and four-fold, respectively, compared to SFCM from NBF cells (Figure 4). Similar results were obtained with CAF/TCF-180 and \u2212142 pairs (Figure 4). For CAF/TCF-114, both enhanced the proliferation of MCF10A by four-fold at 24 h of incubation (Figure 4). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs also enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner.TCF-conditioned medium enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. MCF10A cells were cultured in SFCMs from the indicated fibroblasts from four patients and proliferation measured at the indicated times using the WST-1 assay, compared to SFCMs from the two NBF cultures performed at the same time. Error bars represent \u00b1 SDTCFs promote migration/invasion and induce mesenchymal features of breast cancer cellsWe next investigated the effect of TCF cells on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. SFCMs collected from TCF-180, CAF-180 and NBF-6 were added to MCF-7 cells (105) that had previously been seeded in the upper compartments of migration/invasion plates. Figure 5A shows that the number of migrated MCF-7 cells was much higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF-180 and TCF-180 than with NBF-6 cells or SFM (used as negative control). Figure 5A shows that SFCMs from both CAF-180 and TCF-180 enhanced about 73-fold the migration ability of these breast cancer cells as compared to NBF-6.TCF cells enhance the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells and promote EMT. (A) SCFMs from the indicated cells were added into the lower compartments of 24-well BD BioCoat plates. MCF-7 cells (105) were seeded onto the upper compartment of the plates and incubated for 24 h. The numbers of invaded and migrated cells are presented (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005). (B, C) MCF-7 or normal luminal epithelial cells (NLEC) were treated with the indicated SFCMs for 24 h and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodiesNext, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism/pathway that underlies TCF-dependent increase in the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we explored the paracrine effect of TCF cells on the phosphorylation/activation of Akt, a known pro-invasive protein kinase. Epithelial MCF-7 cells were treated with SFM or SFCM from TCF-180 and CAF-180 for 24 h. Figure 5B shows that SFCMs from TCF and CAF cells increased the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt, with no effect on the level of total protein. Since active Akt and the increase in the invasiveness/migratory abilities of breast cancer cells accompany the transition of these epithelial cells to the mesenchymal phenotype, we assessed the level of N-cadherin and Snail and showed that SFCM from TCF cells increased the level of these two important markers of mesenchymal cells (Figure 5B). On the other hand, the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were markedly reduced (Figure 5B). These results indicate that, like CAFs, TCF cells have the ability to trigger the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process.TCF cells activate Akt and up-regulate PCNA and MMP-2 in normal luminal cells in a paracrine mannerSince TCFs are present in histologically normal parts of the breast, we sought to investigate their effect on primary normal luminal epithelial cells (NLECs). Therefore, NLECs were incubated for 24 h with SFCMs from TCF, CAF and NBF, and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting. Figure 5C shows increase in the level of the proliferation marker PCNA in luminal cells pretreated with SFCMs from CAF and TCF cells, with a higher effect of CAF cells (Figure 5C). Similarly, the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt and also MMP-2 increased under the paracrine effect of TCF and CAF cells (Figure 5C). This shows that, like CAF cells, TCFs have the ability to promote tumourigenesis in normal luminal epithelial cells.TCFs stimulate breast cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse modelTo investigate the effect of fibroblasts on tumour growth in vivo, 15 nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer tumours were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. All mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and CAF-180 cells developed tumours. On the other hand, while two of five mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and TCF-180 cells had tumours, only one mouse co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and NBF-6 cells developed a tumour (Figure 6A). Importantly, this tumour appeared 29 days post-injection, while tumours containing TCF and CAF cells appeared only 15 days after implantation (Figure 6B). Furthermore, at 40 days post-injection, while the size of the tumour containing NBF-6 cells reached a volume of 1.4 cm3, the tumours containing TCF and CAF cells reached 4 cm3 and 7 cm3 on average, respectively (Figure 6A, B). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs have the ability to promote tumour formation and growth compared to normal fibroblasts.TCFs enhance the formation and the growth of human breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice. Breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells under the nipples of nude mice. (A) Tumour size 40 days post-injection. (B) Time-dependent tumour growth (mean \u00b1 SD)DiscussionWe have shown here that breast stromal fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins exhibit a specific gene expression pattern compared to cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal breast fibroblasts, with 77 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and NBFs and 42 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and their paired CAFs. Intriguingly, the expression pattern of 49 genes was specific for TCF cells, as compared to CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues around tumours may also be affected by the presence of tumour cells. Notably, the genes that were found differentially expressed uniquely in TCFs were enriched with biological processes and functions related to, among others, inflammatory response, response to stimulus, immune cell trafficking, tissue development and cell signalling (see Supplementary material, Figure S1A, Table S2). To elucidate how these deregulated genes are interacting with genes in various metabolic pathways, the DEGs were mapped to gene networks using the ingenuity knowledge base. The network analysis revealed the potentially important role of CCL13, CTGF, CYP1B1, IGFBP7 and B4GALT1 (see Supplementary material, Figure S1B). Interestingly, genes deregulated in TCF cells interact, directly or indirectly, with the UBC gene (see Supplementary material, Figure S1C), which plays an essential role in maintaining ubiquitin levels, especially under stress conditions. Indeed, this polyubiquitin gene is up-regulated by cellular stresses and contains classical heat-shock elements in its promoter, suggesting that stress-related factors are involved in the TCF-specific gene expression profile and may relate to evidence that cancer cells use oxidative stress to activate adjacent fibroblasts. Comparing the variation in gene expression in each cell type showed variability within the three categories of cells. Interestingly, the gene expression profiles of TCF cells were more heterogeneous than those of CAF and NBF cells (Figure 1C), indicating higher patient-to-patient variability in stromal fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues.Differential gene expression between CAF and TCF cells from breast tumours has been reported previously. Bauer et al found 37 genes differentially expressed between six paired TCFs and CAFs and have also shown higher gene expression variability in TCF than in CAF cells. In another study, 420 genes were found to be differentially expressed between CAFs and normal breast fibroblasts from mammoplasties (NBFs). Similarly, we have shown here that the expression of 101 genes varied between CAF and NBF cells. However, the current study presents the first micro-array comparative analysis between surgical margin fibroblasts, their corresponding CAFs and NBFs. In addition, we have shown that fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins have higher migratory/invasiveness abilities than normal breast fibroblasts. Furthermore, these cells enhanced the proliferation rate of non-carcinogenic epithelial cells and the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as the formation/growth of breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice (Figures 5, 6). Interestingly, like CAFs, TCFs induced features of mesenchymal cells in breast cancer cells. Moreover, TCFs up-regulated PCNA and MMP2 and activated Akt in normal breast luminal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. This indicates that these cells have the ability to promote cancer development and progression. This effect could be mediated through secretion of cytokines and/or energy transfer mechanisms (reverse Warburg effect).Notably, the magnitude of all these TCF-related effects was intermediate between those of CAFs and NBFs. This shows that, despite their localization in histologically normal breast tissues and not being in direct contact with cancer cells, TCFs acquired some myofibroblast features, suggesting that cancer cells can affect not only cancer-associated fibroblasts but also fibroblasts present in cancer-free adjacent tissues. This effect could be mediated through secreted molecules able to diffuse from cancer cells through normal tissue, reaching distant cells. TGF\u03b2 could play an important role in this effect. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 can induce the production of \u03b1-SMA in mammary fibroblasts in vitro and consequently transdifferentiates fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. It is also possible that cancer cells activate adjacent fibroblasts through the aerobic glycolysis process (Warburg effect), which produces pyruvate and lactate. Indeed, treatment with lactate transport inhibitor prevented the conversion of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts.Our data indicate that remaining active fibroblasts following resection may enhance the chances of tumour recurrence, since these cells may constitute a fertile soil for tumour growth. To date, the most appropriate amount of normal breast tissue that should be removed to minimize local recurrence remains controversial. However, it is well known that local recurrence in patients submitted to conservative surgery is more common than in patients treated by mastectomy, showing the importance of surgical margins status for local relapse. Furthermore, several publications have reported the importance of the pathological margin status in determining the risk of local recurrence after breast conserving therapy. In conclusion, the present data show that breast stromal fibroblasts localized in cancer-free surgical margins are active and hence can potentiate the carcinogenesis process, and indicate that the tumour microenvironment may play determinant roles in local recurrence. Therefore, in the era of personalized therapy, the status of tumour stroma should also be taken into consideration for more efficient treatment and the prevention of recurrence as well as metastasis.Author contributionsMAA, S-FH and AAl performed experiments and analysed the data; FA performed experiments on the mice; DC and NK performed the micro-array data analysis; OA provided the tissues; AA supervised the work and analysed the data; and DC and AA wrote the paper.

IntroductionBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasia among women worldwide, accounting for 25% of all cancer cases. Despite advances in early detection and adjuvant treatment, about 30% of patients may experience recurrent disease and will eventually die of it. Therefore, there is a critical need for the discovery of adequate therapeutic and prognosis biomarkers to improve clinical outcomes.In many solid tumors, malignant initiation and progression is associated with the activation of stromal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), characterized by the expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activated protein (FAP). CAFs are the predominant cellular component within the host stromal constituents and, acting as a motile cohesive unit able to penetrate the cancerous compartment and as a paracrine signaling source niche, possess the abilities to drive tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. The key features of CAFs, which distinguish them from their normal counterparts, include their growth characteristic, migratory behavior, and biosynthetic activities, such as altered expression of growth factors and cytokines (e.g., transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and II (IGF-II), leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7), C-X-C motif Chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and 16 (CXCL16)). However, in spite of these studies, strategies to treat human breast cancer stroma are just beginning to emerge.Specific phosphodiesterase (PDE)5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil, are being used in clinical practice to treat erectile dysfunction (ED) as well as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but these agents have also been identified as one of the most successful cases of drug repurposing because they were initially developed for angina and then repositioned for further disorders. In this scenario, recent attention in examining their potential uses as anticancer agents acting with new mechanisms has been drawn, due to the detection of enhanced PDE5 levels in various human tumors in comparison with normal or surrounding non-cancerous tissues. PDE5 inhibitors are effective, safe, and well-tolerated molecules that act by specifically inhibiting the activity of PDE5, a metallo-hydrolase with the unique function of catalyzing the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) into its biologically inactive 5\u2032-derivative, thus modulating the amplitude and duration of cGMP levels and the associated biological responses. The signaling mediated by cGMP, via several activated downstream effectors, including PKG (cGMP-dependent protein kinase), cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels and/or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathways, has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor pathway, halting tumor growth, invasiveness, and angiogenesis. On the other hand, altered cGMP homeostasis and increased PDE5 expression have been described in several human carcinomas, such as those of the breast. In breast cancer clinical samples, PDE5 overexpression was validated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assays, and was associated with important clinical parameters, such as tumor grading, stage, lymph node positivity, and poor prognosis. Accordingly, several \u2018in vitro\u2019 observations have shown anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of PDE5 inhibitors. These drugs may also act as chemopreventive agents, due to their ability to suppress 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the blockade of PDE5, which is mainly expressed in the stromal compartment of the prostate, reduced fibroblast proliferation and reverted fibroblast-to-myofibroblast trans-differentiation of primary prostatic stromal cells, a hallmark of stromal remodeling, highlighting the potential of PDE5 inhibitors to target the stromal compartment.Herein, we show for the first time, that PDE5 is overexpressed in breast cancer stroma and plays an important role in pro-neoplastic features of activated fibroblasts through the secretion of CXCL16. Our results identified a novel molecular target able to abrogate stromal\u2013tumor cell interactions and thus attenuate breast tumorigenesis, with important implications in translational oncology.2. Results2.1. Aberrant High PDE5 Expression in the Stroma Is Associated with Breast Cancer ProgressionTo investigate the role of PDE5 stromal expression in breast cancer, we first analyzed its levels using a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset consisting of stroma derived from invasive ductal breast carcinomas and individual-matched normal breast adjacent tissues. PDE5 expression was significantly higher in breast cancer stroma samples as compared to normal ones (Figure 1A). However, its expression did not significantly associate with molecular subtypes, lymph node status, grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 positivity, most probably due to the small number of patients in each subgroup. Importantly, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis showed that increased PDE5 stromal levels were correlated with a statistically significant shorter overall survival of breast cancer patients in respect to tumors expressing low levels of the enzyme in their stroma (Figure 1B), proposing a potential role for stromal PDE5 in breast carcinoma progression.To confirm these clinical observations, fibroblasts were extracted from two human invasive mammary ductal carcinomas (named as CAFs 1 and 2) and characterized on the basis of their long and spindle-shaped morphology and elevated expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) as compared to normal fibroblasts (NFs) (Supplementary Figure S1). Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that PDE5 mRNA expression was higher in CAFs than NFs (Figure 2A). Increased PDE5 expression in CAFs was also confirmed by evaluating protein levels using immunoblotting (Figure 2B). Of relevance, treatment with the PDE5 inhibitors sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil significantly reduced the expression of activated fibroblast markers, such as FAP and \u03b1-SMA in CAFs (Figure 2C). Furthermore, inhibition of PDE5 activity resulted in a significant decrease in CAF proliferation (Figure 2D,E), motility (Figure 2F,G), and invasion (Figure 2H). In line with previous findings shown in cancer epithelial cells, our data also highlighted a major role for PDE5 in controlling migration and invasion processes in stromal cells. We then investigated whether PDE5 may function as a possible regulator of CAF impact on adjacent breast tumor cell proliferation and migration by using co-culture experiments. MCF-7 breast cancer epithelial cells, a commonly used and well characterized \u2018in vitro\u2019 model of the most frequent human breast cancer subtype (i.e., luminal A estrogen receptor-positive one), were co-cultured with conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAFs treated with sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil and growth was assessed by soft agar anchorage-independent assay (Figure 2I, upper panel). As expected, colony numbers of MCF-7 breast cancer cells were significantly increased in the presence of CAF-derived CM compared to control medium (-), whereas they were significantly reduced when cells were incubated with CM derived from CAFs treated with PDE5 inhibitors. In the same experimental conditions, sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil negatively affected CAF-mediated increase on MCF-7 cell migration (Figure 2I, lower panel).Based on these results showing that PDE5 inhibition may thwart tumor-fostering capabilities of CAFs \u2018in vitro\u2019, mouse xenograft models were used to investigate sildenafil effects on breast cancer growth \u2018in vivo\u2019. To mimic the in vivo conditions where cancer epithelial cells coexist with CAFs within a tumor microenvironment, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were implanted with CAFs into the mouse intrascapular region and tumor growth was observed after the treatment with vehicle or 25 mg/kg/day sildenafil. This administration was well accepted since no modifications in body mass, food/water ingestion, and motor function were detected. Furthermore, after their sacrifice, we did not observe any changes in the weight and the histology of the main organs (i.e., liver, lung, spleen, and kidney) between vehicle- and sildenafil-treated mice, denoting an absence of toxic outcomes at the dose chosen. As presented in Figure 3A, sildenafil treatment induced a significant regression in tumor growth of MCF-7/CAF groups compared to vehicle treatment. Interestingly, hematoxylin and eosin stain revealed an increased infiltration of CAFs into the breast tumor bulk in vehicle-treated mice, but not in sildenafil-treated ones (Figure 3B). Incubation with anti-human Cytokeratin 18 and \u03b1-SMA antibodies was performed to confirm the human epithelial and connective origin in examined tissues (Figure 3B). According to previously shown results, \u03b1-SMA expression in CAFs was reduced after sildenafil exposure. In addition, we revealed in sildenafil-treated xenograft tumors a significant decrease of protein levels of Ki67, a widely recognized proliferation indicator, in breast cancer epithelial cells (Figure 3B).Therefore, these data provide, for the first time, evidence that PDE5 is overexpressed in CAFs and could contribute to their tumor-promoting features.2.2. PDE5 Overexpression Activates Fibroblasts towards a Cancer-Associated Fibroblast PhenotypeTo better evaluate the significance of PDE5 overexpression in stroma, immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were selected to have an experimental \u2018in vitro\u2019 cellular model displaying forced overexpression of this enzyme. PDE5 cDNA, cloned in frame with the enhanced-green-fluorescent-protein (EGFP) in mammalian pEGFP-C1 expression vector, was stably transfected in MEFs and obtained clones were examined by using immunoblotting analysis. The presence of endogenous (~95 kDa) and exogenous (EGFP-tagged, ~125 kDa) PDE5 bands in protein extracts from PDE5-overexpressing stable clones was shown (Figure 4A). First, we evaluated whether the overexpression of PDE5 may induce modifications in cellular phenotype, such as proliferative, motile, and invasive features of MEFs. MTT and cell count anchorage-dependent growth assays revealed an increase in cell proliferation in PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts (PDE5 1 and 2) in comparison with control vector-expressing clones (V) (Figure 4B,C). Then, we assessed whether PDE5 overexpression may influence fibroblast motility in wound-healing assays and observed that PDE5-overexpressing cells moved faster than V clones (Figure 4D). Accordingly, we also found that PDE5 overexpression significantly increased both motility and invasion of MEFs in Boyden chamber transmigration and invasion assays, respectively (Figure 4E,F). We then evaluated whether PDE5 overexpression could affect actin organization, specifically actin stress-fiber formation that is crucial in the transmission of the cellular forces required for motility. In vector-expressing fibroblasts, actin fibers were visible as bright structures diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, while an increase of stress fiber formation was evident in PDE5-expressing MEFs (Figure 4G, upper panel). Accordingly, markers of fibroblast motility, including N-cadherin, \u03b1-SMA, Rho A-C, Rac 1-3, and cdc42, were up-regulated in PDE5 1 and 2 cells (Figure 4G, lower panel and 4H). After having evaluated the effects of PDE5 overexpression on fibroblast phenotype, we investigated whether or not PDE5 overexpression may impact tumor\u2013stroma crosstalk in co-culture experiments. Soft agar assay showed that colony numbers of MCF-7 breast cancer cells were significantly increased when cells were incubated with CM derived from vehicle-treated PDE5-overexpressing MEFs compared to CM derived from vehicle-treated vector-expressing MEFs, while this induction was no longer evident when cells were co-cultured with CM derived from sildenafil-treated PDE5-overexpressing MEFs (Figure 4I, upper panel). As shown in Figure 4I (lower panel), PDE5 overexpression in MEFs also stimulated breast cancer cell motility and sildenafil treatment of CAFs reversed these effects, further highlighting the potential of PDE5 to influence stromal fibroblast activation.To extend the results obtained, we generated pools of pEGFP-Vector (V P) and pEGFP-PDE5 (PDE5 P) stable transfectants in MEFs (Supplementary Figure S2A). As previously demonstrated, increased proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities of MEFs (Supplementary Figure S2B\u2013F) along with elevated expression of CAF markers (Supplementary Figure S2G,H) were observed in the presence of PDE5 overexpression. Again, growth and migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells were enhanced in the presence of CM derived from PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts compared to vector pools and this increase was reversed in the presence of CM derived from sildenafil-treated PDE5 pools (Supplementary Figure S2I).Some studies have reported that cancer epithelial cells can also shape tumor stroma. Interestingly, when MEFs were co-cultured with MCF-7 breast cancer cells, they exhibited an up-regulation of PDE5 in terms of both mRNA and protein levels (Figure 4L), supporting the idea that the \u2018host\u2019 stroma talks to and coevolves with the malignant epithelium during progression.2.3. CXCL16 Mediates the Tumor Promoting Effects of PDE5-Overexpressing FibroblastsActivated fibroblasts secrete a number of signaling molecules that promote tumorigenesis. Therefore, to gain more insights into the biological properties of PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts, we analyzed factors secreted from vector (V) and PDE5-overexpressing (PDE5 2) clones by cytokine array (Figure 5A). The comparison of the secretome between the two cell models revealed differences in several secreted proteins, and among them, the chemokine CXCL16 was the most highly upregulated in response to PDE5 overexpression. To validate this expression profile, we first compared the mRNA levels of CXCL16 in vector and PDE5-transfected cells. As shown in Figure 5B, increased expression of this gene was detected in cloned PDE5-expressing fibroblasts compared with vector ones. Moreover, ELISA (Figure 5C) and immunofluorescent staining (Figure 5D) revealed higher protein expression levels of CXCL16 in PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts than in vector MEFs. Consistent with these results, treatment with a neutralizing antibody to CXCL16 reduced proliferation (Figure 5E), motility (Figure 5F), and invasion (Figure 5G) of PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts. More relevantly, treatment with the CXCL16 neutralizing antibody was able to significantly abolish the stimulatory effects exerted by CM derived from PDE5-overexpressing MEFs on both growth and motility of MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Figure 5H).Collectively, these results strongly suggest that increased stromal PDE5 may influence fibroblast phenotype and their effects on breast cancer cell growth and motility through CXCL16.2.4. Association of PDE5 and CXCL16 in the Stroma of Breast Cancer PatientsIn order to further examine the role of CXCL16 as a key player in PDE5-associated stromal activation, we evaluated changes in CXCL16 expression in human breast CAFs treated with PDE5 inhibitors. Real-time RT-PCR assay revealed that treatment with sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil led to a significant reduction of CXCL16 mRNA levels (Figure 6A). In addition, both ELISA (Figure 6B) and immunofluorescent staining (Figure 6C) demonstrated that PDE5 inhibition reduced CXCL16 protein expression in CAFs. Accordingly, immunohistochemistry analysis in mouse tumor tissues showed that sildenafil decreased stromal CXCL16 levels also \u2018in vivo\u2019 (Figure 6D).Finally, to support the clinical significance of these findings, we analyzed CXCL16 expression levels in the previously mentioned human breast tumor stroma microarray. CXCL16 expression was found to be higher in stroma samples of invasive ductal carcinomas compared to normal adjacent stroma (Figure 6E). The Kaplan\u2013Meier overall survival curve indicated that increased expression levels of stroma CXCL16 are associated with a statistically significant shorter survival (Figure 6F). As previously shown for stromal PDE5, CXCL16 expression did not significantly correlate with breast cancer molecular subtypes, lymph node status, grade, ER, PR, and HER2 positivity. However, we found that CXCL16 showed a strong correlation with PDE5 expression in the same dataset (p = 0.00023). In addition, patients with high PDE5 and high CXCL16 levels had a statistically significantly poorer overall survival compared with all other patients (Figure 6G).Therefore, high levels of PDE5 and CXCL16 can be detected in breast tumor stroma and their stromal expression may predict poor outcome among breast cancer patients.3. DiscussionWhile the initial view was that PDE5 is highly expressed and can function in breast cancer cells, we show here that this enzyme is also upregulated in CAFs when compared to normal fibroblasts and this overexpression is a part of the dialogue between breast cancer cells and CAFs, allowing CAFs via CXCL16 secretion to promote breast cancer progression. These data shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the cross-talk of stromal-tumor cells and may hold prognostic information as well as a new strategy for stromal cell targeting.Over a century ago, the seminal work of English surgeon Stephen Paget reported that cancer cells constitute the \u2018seeds\u2019 that colonize a receptive stromal microenvironment acting as a favorable \u2018soil\u2019. A crucial \u2018soil\u2019 compartment is represented by fibroblasts that acquire a cancerous phenotype in response to the \u2018seed\u2019 cancer cells to facilitate their proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Thus, CAFs not only support, but are the key protagonists in breast carcinogenesis, owing to their abundance and their tumor-promoting roles. However, the molecular genetic drivers governing the emergence of CAF cellular behavior and the regulation of stromal\u2013epithelial interactions are still poorly understood. Some reports have shown that specific gene transcripts within CAFs may be involved in breast cancer cell growth and metastasis, such as the loss of p85\u03b1, the Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), or TGF-receptor type 2 as well as the overexpression of cyclin D1. Herein, we show that PDE5 overexpression may represent an important feature of fibroblast activation and heterotypic signaling promotion within the breast tumor microenvironment. Indeed, we found that the levels of PDE5 gene are increased in breast cancer stroma compared to normal stroma and this overexpression correlates with the worst survival outcomes, supporting the idea that stromal PDE5 may have an important effect on breast tumor growth. Indeed, stable overexpression of PDE5 activates normal fibroblasts towards a cancer-associated phenotype, as revealed by enhanced cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities along with the increased expression of activated fibroblast markers. PDE5 overexpression in fibroblasts also enhanced breast\u2013tumor crosstalk in \u2018co-culture\u2019 experiments. The functional relevance of stromal PDE5 was highlighted by the inhibitory effects exerted by PDE5-targeting drugs on the activated features of breast CAFs and on breast tumor progression in both \u2018in vitro\u2019 and \u2018in vivo\u2019 experimental models. Of relevance, we found that normal fibroblasts co-cultured with breast cancer cells exhibited an increased PDE5 mRNA and protein expression, pointing out stromal PDE5 as a likely actor in the bidirectional crosstalk between the cancer bulk and its surrounding microenvironment.Accumulating evidences suggest that a wide array of signaling molecules, importantly chemokines, stand at the crossroads of tumor\u2013fibroblast interactions and subsequently impact most of the hallmark capabilities of breast cancer. For instance, the C-X-C chemokine network represents a unique group of molecules and receptors recognized for their involvement in tumor biology, including their direct effects on cancer cells, such as transformation, survival, and proliferation, and indirect effects, such as angiogenesis and immune cell recruitment into tumor sites. Several studies have proposed a multifaceted role for CXCL16/CXCR6 axis in the progression of different tumors, including those of the prostate, liver, ovaries, and breast, as was widely demonstrated for CXCL12 and its cognate receptor CXCR4 pair. Indeed, CXCR6 and CXCL16 are upregulated in multiple cancer tissues, including primary and metastatic tissues, and cancer cell lines compared to respective normal ones and their levels increase as tumor malignancy progresses. Moreover, CXCL16 via interaction with CXCR6 is capable of increasing cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in breast cancer. Our findings indicated that PDE5 overexpression can activate stromal fibroblasts to produce and secrete CXCL16 that, in turn, may contribute to breast cancer progression by serving as a proliferative signal and as a regulator of motility. Accordingly, the addition of a CXCL16 neutralizing antibody abolished the pro-tumoral stimulatory effects of conditioned medium derived from PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts on breast cancer cell growth and migration. However, fibroblast-secreted CXCL16 not only orchestrates paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling to the adjacent breast cancer cells, but it can also modulate intrinsic characteristics of activated fibroblasts in an autocrine manner, since a significant inhibition in the proliferative, motile, and invasive capabilities of activated PDE5-overexpressing fibroblasts was evident in the presence of a CXCL16 neutralizing antibody. On the other hand, PDE5 inhibition significantly reduced CXCL16 expression and secretion in CAFs, indicating that CXCL16 and PDE5 levels can be correlated. Indeed, as shown for stromal PDE5 levels, increased stromal expression of CXCL16 was found in breast cancer stroma compared to the corresponding normal tissue stroma and was associated with poor overall survival in Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. More importantly, our results showed a significant association between the expression levels of PDE5 and CXCL16 in the stroma of breast cancer patients and a statistically significantly poorer overall survival in patients with high PDE5 and high CXCL16 levels compared with all other patients.4.

Isolation and Culture of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Normal FibroblastsEstablishment of human breast fibroblast cells from fresh tumors (CAFs) and normal tissues (NFs) were obtained from women who signed informed consent, following previously described procedures. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics, tested by mycoplasma presence (MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Assay, Lonza, Basilea, CH, Svizzera), and characterized as shown in Supplementary Figure S1. All experiments were performed before the 10th passage. These study was approved by the Ethic Institutional Committees at Annunziata Hospital, Cosenza, Italy (#149 issued by Comitato Etico Regione Calabria, Sezione Area Nord c/o Azienza Ospedaliera di Cosenza, 28/10/2015). Experimental procedures for fibroblast isolation were performed in accordance with approved guidelines.4.3. Cell CulturesMouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines were from American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines, stored and authenticated following suppliers, were used within six months after frozen aliquot resuscitations and were regularly tested for mycoplasma-negativity (MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Assay). To generate PDE5A-overexpressing MEFs, cells were transfected with pEGFP-vector or pEGFP-PDE5A vector (5 \u00b5g/10 cm dishes) using Fugene 6 reagent, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Stable clones were selected with G418 antibiotic (1 mg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific). PDE5-expressing MEF pools stably transfected with pEGFP-vector or pEGFP-PDE5A vectors were also used. Positive clones were identified using immunoblot analysis.4.4. Conditioned Medium SystemsCAFs or MEF stable clones were treated as indicated in the respective experiments for 8\u201312 h. Then, cells were washed twice and cultured with 3% charcoal-stripped serum medium for 36 h. In another set of experiments, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were cultured with 3% charcoal-stripped serum media for 24 h. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected, centrifuged, and used in co-culture experiments.4.5. Real-Time RT-PCR AssaysFAP, \u03b1-SMA, PDE5, and CXCL16 gene expression was assessed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, using SYBR Green Universal PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Anchorage-independent growth assays were performed as described.Data represent three independent experiments performed in triplicate.4.8. Wound Healing AssaysCell monolayers were scraped and exposed to the following experimental conditions: (i) CAFs were treated with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil (10 \u00b5M); (ii) vector and PDE5 stable pools or stable clones were left under basal nonstimulated conditions; (iii) MCF-7 cells were treated with control medium or conditioned medium derived from CAFs exposed to vehicle, sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil (10 \u00b5M) or conditioned medium derived from vector and PDE5-overexpressing stable clones exposed to vehicle or sildenafil (10 \u00b5M) or CXCL16 blocking antibody (1.5 \u00b5g/mL) or conditioned medium derived from vector and PDE5-overexpressing stable pools exposed to vehicle or sildenafil (10 \u00b5M). Wound closure was monitored over 8\u201312 hours, cells were fixed and stained with Coomassie Brillant Blue. Pictures represent one of three independent experiments.4.9. Boyden Chamber Transmigration AssaysCAFs treated with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil (10 \u00b5M) were placed in the upper compartments of Boyden chambers (8 \u00b5m-membranes, Corning). In another set of experiments, vector and PDE5-overexpressing stable pools or stable clones left under basal nonstimulated conditions and vector and PDE5 stable clones exposed to vehicle or CXCL16 blocking antibody (1.5 \u00b5g/mL) were placed in the upper compartments of Boyden chambers. Bottom wells contained regular growth media. After 8\u201312 h, migrated cells were fixed and stained with DAPI. Migration was quantified by viewing six separate fields per membrane at 10\u00d7 magnification (OLYMPUS-BX51 microscope) and expressed as mean numbers of migrated cells. Data represent three independent experiments, each assayed in triplicate.4.10. Boyden Chamber Invasion AssaysMatrigel-based invasion assay was performed in chambers (8 \u00b5m-membranes, Corning) coated with Matrigel (BD Bioscences, 2 mg/mL). Cells under the same experimental conditions indicated in Section 4.9 were seeded into top transwell-chambers and regular growth medium was used in the lower chambers. After 8\u201312 h, invaded cells were quantified as reported for transmigration assays. Data represent three independent experiments, each assayed in triplicate.4.11. Fluorescence MicroscopyCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS +0.2% Triton X-100 and immunofluorescent staining was performed as previously described. 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) staining was used for nuclei detection. Fluorescence was photographed at 100\u00d7 magnification (OLYMPUS-BX51 microscope, Segrate, IT, Italy).4.12. Phalloidin StainingPolymerized actin stress fibers were stained with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated phalloidin (1:500), following manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Olympus BX51 microscope (100\u00d7 magnification) was used for imaging.4.13. Mouse Cytokine ArrayMEF stable clones were cultured with 3% charcoal-stripped serum media for 36 h. CM was collected, centrifuged, and used in mouse cytokine arrays (AAM-CYT-3, Raybiotech), as described in the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.4.14. CXCL16 Measurement by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Mouse CXCL16 was measured in MEF CM by using RayBio Mouse CXCL16 ELISA Kit based on the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (RayBiotech, Peachtree Corners, GA, USA). Human CXCL16 was measured in CAF CM by using RayBio Human CXCL16 ELISA Kit based on the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (RayBiotech). Results are presented as pg/mL/number of cells.4.15. \u2018In Vivo\u2019 ExperimentsThe \u2018in vivo\u2019 experiments were performed in 45-day-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories, Udine, Italy) maintained in a sterile environment. The animals were fully anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of avertin 250 mg/kg to allow the subcutaneous implantation of estradiol (E2) pellets (0.72 mg per pellet, 90-day release; Innovative Research of America) into the dorso-lateral region. The day after, exponentially growing MCF-7 cells (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in combination with CAFs (ratio 3:1 tumor cells/CAFs) were inoculated subcutaneously in 0.1 mL of Matrigel into the intrascapular region. The subcutaneous location was chosen to exclude the effect of other mammary gland cellular components on the interaction of human breast cancer fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Sildenafil treatment (25 mg/kg/day) was started when mean tumor size reached 150 mm3 (day 0) and was delivered daily to the animals by i.p. injection. Tumor development was followed twice a week by caliper measurements along two orthogonal axes: length (L) and width (W). The volume (V) of tumors was estimated by the following formula: V = L \u00d7 (W2)/2. At day 20 the animals were sacrificed following the standard protocols and tumors were dissected from the neighboring connective tissue. Specimens of tumors were frozen in nitrogen and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C. The remaining tumor tissues of each sample, livers, lungs, spleens, and kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for the histological analyses. All animals were maintained and handled in accordance with the recommendation of the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of University of Calabria, Italy (1290/2015-PR, 18/12/2015).4.16. Histopathological AnalysisTumors, livers, lungs, spleens, and kidneys were fixed in 4% formalin, sectioned into 5 \u03bcm of thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin Y (H&E), as suggested by the manufacturer (Bio-Optica). H&E was photographed at 20\u00d7 magnification (Olympus BX51 microscope, Segrate, IT, Italy).4.17. Immunohistochemical Analysis Paraffin-embedded sections, 5 \u03bcm thick, were mounted on slides precoated with poly-lysine, and then they were deparaffinized and dehydrated (seven to eight serial sections). Immunohistochemical experiments were performed after heat-mediated antigen retrieval, using human Cytokeratin 18, \u03b1-SMA, Ki-67, or CXCL16 primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Then, a biotinylated specific IgG was applied for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the avidin biotin alkaline phosphatase complex (VECTASTAIN\u00ae ABC-AP KIT, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Immunoreactivity was visualized by using VECTOR\u00ae Red Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories). Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin (Sigma Aldrich). The primary antibody was replaced by normal serum in negative control sections. The immunostained slides of tumor samples were evaluated by light microscopy using the Allred score, which combines a proportion score and an intensity score. A proportion score was assigned representing the estimated proportion of positively stained tumor cells (0 = none; 1 = 1/100; 2 = 1/100 to <1/10; 3 = 1/10 to <1/3; 4 = 1/3 to 2/3; 5 = >2/3). An intensity score was assigned by the average estimated intensity of staining in positive cells (0 = none; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; 3 = strong). Proportion score and intensity score were added to obtain a total score that ranged from 0 to 8. A minimum of 100 cells were evaluated in each slide. Six to seven serial sections were scored in a blinded manner for each sample. The one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences in the scores between tumor and control samples.4.18. Analysis of Human Stroma Gene Expression DataThe data regarding human breast cancer stroma-based gene expression (GSE9014) were downloaded from the the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Briefly, from a cohort of 73 women with invasive breast carcinoma diagnosis (median follow-up time: 3.58 years), 53 samples of tumor stroma and 31 individual-matched normal adjacent stroma samples were collected. ER positive (luminal) samples constituted 72.3% of the patients, HER2 enriched (HER2 positive ER negative) constituted 10.3% of the specimens, and triple negative (ER/PR/HER2 negative) constituted 11.8% of the patients. The remaining patients (5.6%) had discordant status for ER and PR determination. No woman in the study was treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Poor outcome was defined as alive with disease or dead of disease at the time of the latest follow-up. This dataset was generated using the Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A platform. The probe 37097 was used to detect PDE5 expression. The dye-swapped repetitions were inverted and averaged to get the final expression value for each sample.4.19. Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed for statistical significance using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test, and GraphPad-Prism 4 software program. SEM is shown. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival plot and log rank p-value were calculated and plotted in R as described. Cox proportional hazard regression was computed to compare the association between gene expression, clinical variables including ER/PR/HER2/lymph node/grade status, and survival in multivariate analysis using WinSTAT 2014 for Microsoft Excel (WinStat 2014, Robert K. Fitch Software, Bad Krozingen, DE, Germany). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.5. ConclusionsBreast tumor microenvironment represents a functional ecosystem of neoplastic epithelial cells and stroma with critical roles in most of cancer progression processes. Therefore, it is not surprising that an increasing proportion of research is currently focusing on the development of double-acting anti-cancer strategies targeted toward both breast cancer cells and tumor microenvironment. Another more pragmatic reason underlying the exciting interest on anti-stromal therapies is that stromal cells are more genetically stable than cancer cells. In light of the present and our previous study, we can speculate that PDE5 activity may regulate several aspects of breast carcinogenesis both directly on neoplastic epithelial cells and indirectly via modulation of CAF phenotype. Therefore, since PDE5 inhibitors are safely and successfully used in patients suffering from different pathologies, our results may endorse their use as repurposed concurrent treatments to conventional anti-cancer agents to provide more effective options for breast cancer women. To date, a randomized Phase I trial was completed for evaluating the potential of sildenafil to enhance doxorubicin anti-tumor effects and cardioprotection in breast cancer patients (NCT01375699), but no details have been published yet. In addition, stromal PDE5 may represent not only a feasible therapeutic target but may also hold a potential prognostic value identifying patients with a poorer clinical outcome. Taken together, the present findings may open a promising research area which needs to be further explored for deepening our understanding of tumor evolution and offering new avenue for future cancer management.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at .

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

This might be a common mechanism for acquiring metastatic potential in breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, tumours with the same clinical and pathological status may differ in metastatic potential, and therefore lead to different prognoses. Metastasis of breast cancer cells requires decreased cell\u2013cell adhesion, but increased cell\u2013extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, and enhanced invasiveness and motility via secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes and cytoskeletal reorganisation. A well-recognised mechanism for initiating tumour cell invasive and metastatic behaviour is epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which polarised epithelial breast cancer cells acquire a motile mesenchymal phenotype. However, the common mechanisms of induction of metastasis in breast cancers with different biological characteristics remain undefined. A better understanding of such mechanisms could lead to find universal molecular targets for anti-metastasis therapy.The metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is closely dependent on the tumour microenvironment. The fibroblast is the predominant stromal cell type in tumour microenvironment of heterogeneous breast cancer tissues. Tumour cells activate stromal fibroblast cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through the stimulation of paracrine growth factors, and CAFs are more effective than normal stromal fibroblasts in promoting the cell survival, growth and progression of cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts secrete a number of growth factors, including transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), which is a strong extracellular signal regulating EMT in cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts also secrete chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)/stromal derived factor1 (SDF-1) to induce EMT of cancer cells. In addition, ECM, the non-cellular composition of the tumour microenvironment, is mainly synthesised by CAFs. It functions as a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells through ECM remodelling by ECM-degrading proteases secreted from cancer cells with the EMT phenotype.There is a consensus that CAFs can affect the metastatic behaviour of breast cancer cells. However, it is unclear how CAFs affect the metastatic potential of breast cancers with different biological characteristics. In the present study, we demonstrated that CAFs could enhance the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells with different characteristics through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Different EMT programmes were activated in different breast cancer cells because of the different responses to CAF paracrine extracellular signalling.Materials and MethodsIsolation and culture of stromal fibroblastsTo isolate stromal fibroblasts, primary cancer tissues were obtained from three female breast cancer patients at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH; Tianjin, China). These patients had undergone mastectomy but had not been treated with preoperative chemotherapy. The tissue specimens were divided into three parts for histopathological diagnosis, mRNA and protein extraction and isolation of stromal fibroblasts. The investigation and the use of specimens were approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH and written consent was obtained from participants.The breast cancer tissue specimens used for isolation of stromal fibroblasts were diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma with histological grade II and classified as luminal A subtype with oestrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative. Importantly, the specimens were assessed by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) to confirm that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells in the heterogeneous cancer tissue (Figure 1A and B).The fresh tissues were sliced and digested with 160\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 collagenase A (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and 25\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009h. Then the cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) until cells grew into a confluent monolayer. After 2\u20133 passages, a unique homogeneity of stromal fibroblasts was formed. All the stromal fibroblasts used in the experiments were at less than 10 passages. To prepare conditioned medium of cultured CAFs (CAF-CM) for breast cancer cell treatments, stromal fibroblasts isolated from three tissue specimens were mixed and cultured for 48\u2009h, then collected and centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 5000\u2009r.p.m. to remove cell debris.Culture of breast cancer cell linesBreast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, each with different biological characteristics and metastatic potential, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) or DMEM/F12 (T47D) medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100\u2009units per ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells in logarithmic growth phase or at 80% confluence were used for experiments. Breast cancer cell lines were treated with the CM of stromal fibroblasts, diluted with an equal volume of fresh medium for 2 days. An equal volume of complete culture medium was used as the control.Cell\u2013ECM adhesion assayBreast cancer cells were plated in Matrigel-coated 12-well plates at 1 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The non-adherent cells were counted after being cultured for the appropriate time and the percentage of adherent cells was calculated as (1\u2013non-adherent cells/total inoculated cells) \u00d7 100%.Wound-healing assayBreast cancer cells were plated in six-well plates at 5 \u00d7 105 cells per well to grow into a monolayer. A linear scratch/wound was made on cell monolayers with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs were taken of live cells at \u00d7 100 magnification and the distance migrated was observed within an appropriate time.Cell migration and invasion assayThe invasion and migration abilities of breast cancer cells in vitro were evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). 5 \u00d7 104 cells in 500\u2009\u03bcl serum-free medium were added to the upper chamber, and medium containing 20% FBS was added into the lower chamber. The cells were left to invade the Matrigel for the appropriate time, the non-invading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by wiping, and the invading cells were fixed and stained with a three-step stain set kit (Richard-Allan Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The number of invading or migrating cells was counted under a microscope in five predetermined fields for each membrane at \u00d7 400 magnification.TGF-\u03b2 signalling analysisBreast cancer cells were cultured with CM of stromal fibroblasts containing 50\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 TGF-\u03b21 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to neutralise TGF-\u03b21, or 1.0\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009ml\u22121 SB-431542 (Sigma) to block the TGF-\u03b2 signalling of breast cancer cells.Reverse transcription-quantitative PCRTotal RNA of tissues or cultured cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using a First-strand cDNA Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We quantified the transcripts of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal mRNA quantity control, as previously described. All primers and TaqMan probes for cDNA amplification of various target genes were designed and optimised using Oligo 6.0 software (Molecular Biology Insights, West Cascade, USA), and synthesised by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services (Shanghai, China). Triplicate quantitative PCR reactions were performed for both target genes and the housekeeping gene using Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative expression level of the target gene was calculated by normalising the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the target gene to the Ct values of GAPDH (\u0394Ct), and determined as 2\u2212\u0394Ct.ImmunohistochemistryBreast cancer cells growing on sterile coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue specimens were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemistry staining of specimens was carried out using the primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4; DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark), anti-Vimentin (V9; Invitrogen) and anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7; Invitrogen); the secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used at appropriate concentration. Staining was performed with diaminobenzidine; hematoxylin was used for counterstaining.ImmunoblottingHarvested cells were lysed with protein lysis buffer containing 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5\u2009mM EDTA acid, 1% Triton X-100, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% dithiothreitol and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The proteins in the lysate were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The primary antibodies used were anti-Vimentin, anti-E-cadherin, anti-TGF-\u03b2RII (K105; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA), anti-Smad2 (86F7; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-pSmad2 (Phospho-Ser245/250/255; Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20091000, \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20093000, and the secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20092500. The protein blotting on the membranes was performed as previously described. The immunoreactive protein bands on the membranes were visualised using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare).Immunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on the coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009min. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15\u2009min, washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained using DAPI permamount. The protein expression was visualised using a fluorescence microscope.Cytokine antibody array analysisThe TGF\u03b2s secreted from CAFs were analysed using a Cytokine Antibody Array (R&D Systems) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, membranes were incubated with 1.0\u2009ml of CAF-CM at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted biotin-conjugated antibodies were added to each membrane, which was then incubated at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to each membrane and incubated at room temperature for 2\u2009h. The membranes were placed into the mixed Detection Buffer and exposed to X-ray film. The intensities of signals were quantified by ScanAlyze software (Michael Eisen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA).

Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.ResultsThe stromal fibroblasts isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibit characteristics of CAFsTo characterise stromal fibroblasts in the microenvironment of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from primary breast cancer tissues. In the primary breast cancer tissue, we observed that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells (Figure 1A), and some of them were active fibroblasts with positive \u03b1-SMA staining (Figure 1B). The stromal cells separated from primary breast cancer tissues were a heterogeneous mixture of a variety of cells in the primary culture, with fibroblasts being the main component. After passaging the primary culture cells, uniform fibroblasts started to grow (Figure 1C). The stromal fibroblasts showed positive staining for the mesenchymal marker vimentin (Figure 1D) and negative staining for the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Figure 1E). In particular, they expressed the activated myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA (Figure 1F) and CXCL12 (Supplementary Figure 1A). These results indicated that the isolated and cultured fibroblasts in vitro from breast cancer tissues maintained the features of CAFs.To investigate whether the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro are retained features of CAFs, we detected the expression of E-cadherin, \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 in CAFs at different low passages. The results showed that the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 were similar in all the CAFs at different passages, and E-cadherin was not expressed in any CAFs at different passages (Supplementary Figure 1B and C), which indicated that the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro retained the features of CAFs.CAFs enhanced aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cellsTo investigate the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cells with different intrinsic characteristics, the CAF-CM was collected and used to culture breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231. The epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells cultured with CAF-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering. The mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells cultured with CAF-CM were also changed to more fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 2A). All the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM had enhanced cell\u2013ECM adhesion (Figure 2B), migration (Figure 2C\u2013E) and invasion (Figure 2F and G) compared with the control cells. All the above results suggested that CAF-secreted proteins could stimulate these different breast cancer cell lines to change their morphologies and phenotypes to have more metastatic potential.CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cellsTo investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by CAF-CM in breast cancer cell lines, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1), mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM) and fibronectin 1 (FN1), as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with CAF-CM. Results showed that cells cultured with CAF-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in MCF-7 and T47D cells, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3A and C). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker VIM, FN1, MMP2 and MMP9 were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM (Figure 3B and D). These results indicated that factors secreted by CAFs could induce the EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.To investigate whether EMT programming was activated by CAF-secreted factors in these breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics, the expression of EMT-related transcription factors (EMT-TFs) snail homolog 1 (SNAI1), SNAI2, twist basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix transcription factor 1 (TWIST1) and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was measured in breast cancer cell lines cultured with CAF-CM. The results showed that SNAI1 expression levels were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM, SNAI2 expression levels were upregulated in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells but not in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells, TWIST1 expression levels were upregulated in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells but not in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells, and ZEB1 expression levels were upregulated only in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3E). These results indicated that CAF-secreted proteins induced the EMT phenotype through common and/or unique activation of EMT-TFs in breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics.CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling in breast cancer cells via CAF-secreted TGF-\u03b21As TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer, we examined whether CAFs secreted any TGF isoform into CAF-CM. Our results showed that CAFs secreted significantly more TGF-\u03b21 than TGF-\u03b22 or TGF-\u03b23 (Figure 4A). We then compared the mRNA expression of the TGF-\u03b21-coding gene TGFB1 in CAFs and breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that TGFB1 expression levels were significantly higher in CAFs than those in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 was mainly secreted by the CAFs in the co-culture of CAFs with breast cancer cells.To investigate the effect of CAF-CM on activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling in breast cancer cell lines, we compared the expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 receptor type II (TGF-\u03b2RII), total Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad2 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CM or control medium. The results showed that CAF-CM significantly increased phosphorylated Smad2 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, whereas total Smad2 was not affected. Although TGF-\u03b2RII expression levels were different in the three cell lines, they were not affected by culturing with CAF-CM (Figure 4C). Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 secretion by breast cancer cells was not affected neither (Figure 4D). These results indicate that CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling pathway in breast cancer cells mainly through paracrine TGF-\u03b21.EMT programming and phenotype were reversed by blocking TGF-\u03b21 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CMTo further test the role of TGF-\u03b21 signalling in EMT phenotype changes of breast cancer cells, TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody and TGF-\u03b2 signalling blocking reagent SB-431542 were added to CAF-CM for culturing epithelial cells MCF-7 and mesenchymal-like cells MDA-MB-231. Then, the expression of epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers and EMT-TFs were examined. After culturing in CAF-CM, the E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells was reduced, and vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was increased. Moreover, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5A). Similarly, the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was also reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5B). Consistent with the effects of TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody, adding SB-431542 in CAF-CM also reversed the reduced E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM (Figure 5C), as well as the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the enhanced abilities of migration and invasion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding anti-TGF-\u03b21 antibody (Figure 5E and F). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 secreted from CAFs was an important regulator for activation of EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.DiscussionIsolation of stromal fibroblasts from invasive cancer tissues followed by low-passaged cultures in vitro is the main approach to investigate the biological characteristics of CAFs and their effects on tumour cells. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin is commonly used as a marker of myofibroblast formation to identify CAFs, and its expression is higher in fibroblasts derived from cancer tissues than in those derived from normal tissues. Evidence has shown that stromal fibroblasts isolated from cancer tissues such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer retain the characteristics of CAFs, with high levels of \u03b1-SMA expression. As luminal A is the most common subtype of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from invasive luminal A subtype breast cancer tissues, and confirmed that the fibroblasts expressed high levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12/SDF-1, which is a typical characteristic of CAFs. Moreover, CAFs at low passages cultured in vitro retained their original features, which was consistent with the Kalluri's report.There have been reports that CAFs could promote aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cells.) demonstrated that downregulation of p16INK4A transformed normal breast fibroblasts into CAFs, which in turn enhanced migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner.) showed that CAFs enhanced migration by promoting EMT of PMC42-LA cells.) found that CAFs promoted EMT of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells, including luminal cells (MCF-7), basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) and cells with both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial characteristics (PMC42-LA). In this study, we demonstrated that factors secreted by CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviours of cell\u2013ECM adhesion, migration and invasion in both luminal (MCF-7 and T47D) and basal-like (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells by inducing or promoting EMT. This suggests that CAF-induced EMT might be the common mechanism underlying the acquisition of metastatic potential in different breast cancer subtypes.EMT enables cancer cells to acquire the ability to complete various steps in the metastatic cascade, and this change in phenotype of epithelial cancer cells is induced by paracrine signals from their microenvironment. It is known that CAFs can induce or promote EMT in a variety of cancers, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not clear. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer. Tumour cells can induce and maintain the EMT phenotype through autocrine secretion of TGF-\u03b2, and can also transform stromal fibroblasts into CAFs by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Although CAFs can also secrete TGF-\u03b2, it is little known whether or how CAF-paracrine TGF-\u03b2 induces EMT in tumour cells. By detection of the CAF-CM collected from CAFs cultured in vitro, we found that TGF-\u03b21 was the major TGF-\u03b2 family member secreted by CAFs. We also found that TGF-\u03b21 was expressed by CAFs significantly more than by cancer cells, and stimulation of CAF-paracrine factors did not significantly increase expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b2RII in the breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, by using a pharmacological inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase to inhibit the receptors of tumour cells, and neutralising antibodies to inhibit secreted TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs, we found that TGF-\u03b21, mainly secreted by CAFs, could induce EMT in different subtypes of breast cancers.Interestingly, we found that CAF-paracrine signalling induced EMT in breast cancer cells with different characteristics are underlying common and/or unique pleiotropically acting EMT-TFs. SNAI1 was activated by CAF-CM in the three breast cancer cell lines: epithelial/luminal A cells MCF-7 and T47D, and mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells MDA-MB-231. SNAI2 and ZEB1 were activated in epithelial/luminal A cells (SNAI2 in both MCF-7 and T47D, ZEB1 only in MCF-7) but not in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231). TWIST1 was activated in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) but not in epithelial cells/luminal A cells (MCF-7 and T47D). This novel observation indicates that different EMT programmes are activated in different subtypes of breast cancer cells specific to their responses to CAF-paracrine signalling. Another interesting finding in our in vitro experiments is that exogenous TGF-\u03b2 alone did not promote EMT of breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, although TGF-\u03b2 is a key modulator secreted by CAFs for promoting EMT of breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics, it needs co-factors to facilitate this process, and the exact mechanism remains to be further explored.In summary, CAFs could stimulate morphological and phenotypic changes in various breast cancer subtype cells to enhance their metastatic potential through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. This might be a common mechanism for metastasis among breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on British Journal of Cancer website (http://www.nature.com/bjc)This work is published under the standard license to publish agreement.

Histological examinations of human tumors show greater stromal content in more advanced and larger tumors, and high content of stromal cells correlates with greater risk of relapse and reduced survival. Fibroblasts are the most abundant stromal cell type in epithelial tumors. Cancer cells dynamically activate surrounding fibroblasts to produce growth factors, hormones, and cytokines that fuel tumor growth, and facilitate progression to metastasis. These activated fibroblasts, termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), regulate cancer cells through paracrine signaling and direct intercellular interactions. In a study of breast carcinoma, about 80 percent of fibroblasts exhibited an activated phenotype.Production of the chemokine CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1) is a hallmark feature of CAFs. CXCL12 signals through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors upregulated on cancer cells, and activates multiple molecular pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Signaling through these pathways promotes survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling axis is highly active in breast cancers. Analysis of human breast tumors showed that among the different molecular subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells have the most elevated expression of CXCR4. Considering the lack of targeted therapies for TNBC, disrupting this chemokine signaling may offer a potential new therapeutic approach. In addition, investigating pathways downstream of this chemokine signaling axis in TNBC cells potentially will unveil new molecular targets for therapy.Studies of interactions among stroma and cancer cells typically use monolayer cell cultures or xenograft models. Monolayer cultures lack the complexity of tumors including a compact three-dimensional morphology, close intercellular contacts, exposure of cells to gradients of soluble factors and oxygen, and non-uniform, spatially-dependent cell proliferation. Thus, cells in monolayer cultures often fail to reproduce key characteristics of tumors. Xenografts present a physiological system for cancer research. However, they are limited in terms of absence of human tumor stroma, failure of some murine cytokines to activate human receptors, disparities in dynamics of tumor growth and progression compared to human tumors, and need for complex tools and biological assays to study stromal effects on cancer cells. Since the introduction of tissue microarrays and next generation sequencing, these technologies have been used for high throughput assessment of biomarkers in thousands of tumor samples from biopsies using standard assays such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridization. These technologies are an invaluable tool in clinical oncology to develop diagnostic tests and identify disease biomarkers. Nevertheless, tissue microarrays and similar biopsy-based assays for endpoint analysis of fixed samples do not capture dynamic tumor-stromal interactions in tumor microenvironments. Tumors constantly transform both spatially and temporally. Interactions between stromal and cancer cells play a major role in conferring functional changes to cancer cells such as gain of cancer stem cell and mesenchymal characteristics, altered metabolism, drug resistance, migration and invasion, and survival. Mechanistic understanding of these complex events in tumors requires approaches that reproduce dynamic signaling of cancer and stromal cells as it occurs in native tissues.Three-dimensional (3D) cultures of cells as spheroids provide relevant in vitro tumor models to recapitulate architecture and complex intercellular network of tumors and emulate stromal-cancer cells interactions. We recently developed a robotic, high throughput spheroid microprinting technology to mass produce homogenously-sized spheroids that exhibit key biology properties of solid tumors. Here, we utilized this technology and formed an array of co-culture spheroids of TNBC and stromal cells to examine CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on TNBC cells. Using different cellular assays and molecular analyses, we demonstrated that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling significantly increases spheroid proliferation and TNBC cell growth. This signaling conferred resistance to standard chemotherapy drug treatment through activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. We found that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling induces sensitivity of the cancer cells to specific molecular inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways, preventing proliferation of TNBC cells. This work establishes the feasibility of studying tumor-stromal interactions using our engineered solid tumor models and offers a convenient preclinical tool to identify new treatment approaches.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) microprinting of TNBC-stromal cells co-culture spheroidsThe ATPS technology facilitates partitioning of cancer and stromal cells to the DEX phase nanodrop to spontaneously form a mono-culture or a co-culture spheroid within 24\u201348 hours of incubation (Figure 1A\u20131B). Importantly, nutrients and waste products of cells freely diffuse between the DEX phase nanodrop and the immersion PEG phase. Adapting the technology to robotics enabled formation of spheroids in standard 384-microwell plates. For co-culture spheroids, we selected a ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells and a total cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/0.3 \u03bcl of DEX phase drop. This ratio was to mimic more advanced and larger human breast tumors that have greater stromal content than cancer cells. Using larger ratios of 1:3 and 1:4 (breast cancer cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial breast cancer cell density constant at 5 \u00d7 103 cells per DEX phase drop did not alter growth of TNBC cells (Supplementary Figure 1), consistent with other studies. This microprinting approach gave consistently-sized mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (5 \u00d7 103 cells), mono-culture spheroids of fibroblast cells, HMF and CAFs, (1 \u00d7 104 cells), and co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF cells or CAFs (1.5 \u00d7 104 cells with a 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells ratio) (Figure 1C). The spheroid size consistency was measured from two separate experiments to ensure that spheroids of each model had a similar initial metabolic activity baseline. Importantly, the 1.5 \u00d7 104 cell density co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells or CAFs were not statistically different in size (p > 0.05), eliminating potential effects of size differences of the spheroids on the studies reported below. We conveniently maintained spheroids in the same 384-microwell plate used for spheroid formation by robotic exchange of culture medium.(A\u2013B) Cancer cells remain confined in the 0.3 \u00b5l DEX phase drop (purple) suspended in the immiscible immersion PEG phase (pink) and autonomously aggregate to form a co-culture spheroid of triple negative breast cancer cells (green) and human mammary fibroblasts (red) in 48 hrs. Colors in panel (A) are for presentation purpose only.

The co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF that lacked this signaling served as the global negative control. Spheroids were evaluated for their cellular proliferation over a six-day period following formation and in medium containing only 1% FBS at the starting point and no renewal (Figure 2A). The TNBC:CAFs model displayed either a lower or fairly similar activity compared to the TNBC:HMF model, indicating that CXCL12 production by CAFs does not confer growth advantage to TNBC cells lacking the cognate receptors of the chemokine. On the other hand, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model showed overall the highest and continuously increasing activity throughout the culture compared to all the other co-culture spheroids. The CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model also consistently showed 11\u201328% greater activity than its CXCR4+TNBC:HMF counterpart lacking the CXCL12 chemokine as determined by a linear regression analysis. There was no significant difference between cell proliferation in CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids. Interestingly, these models even had lower activity level than the TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs spheroids on each day of measurement. When the effect of expression of both CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cell proliferation was evaluated, the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs model had slightly increased activity, up to 4.5%, than the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF spheroids on certain days. Our statistical analysis of the multivariate, temporally-dependent data resulting from all eight co-culture spheroid models showed that cell proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was significantly different from the seven other models across the six-day culture period (Figure 2B).(A) Growth of co-culture spheroids based on metabolic activity measurements is shown over a six-day period. Spheroids consist of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells at a ratio of 1:2 TNBC:fibroblasts at the starting point of experiments. (B) p-values from a statistical test show that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model is consistently and significantly more proliferative than all the other models.Consistent with reports in mouse models, our finding suggests that the CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 axis is a key mediator of cell proliferation in breast cancer. The effect of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling on promoting primary and metastatic breast tumor growth has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies. Several studies have reported that CXCR7 is a scavenger receptor to prevent saturation of CXCR4 receptors and also to create CXCL12 gradients to facilitate migration of CXCR4+ cancer cells. This provides a plausible explanation for the similar activity levels of the CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture models. We note that the role of the CXCR7 receptor in the presence of CXCL12 signaling remains disputed. For example, studies show that CXCR7 expression lead to growth of primary breast tumors in rat models through promoting angiogenesis, which is consistent with data showing upregulation of this receptor on tumor vasculature. However, results from these studies cannot be correlated with those from our 3D cultures that represent models of avascular tumors. Altogether, these data demonstrate that our 3D cultures recapitulate growth properties of breast tumors. Based on analysis of the data, we selected the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and its respective negative control, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, for mechanistic studies of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling in TNBC.Inhibition and stimulation of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingWe conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate if the higher proliferative activity of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was indeed due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling. The experiments included an inhibition test and a stimulation test. First, we treated spheroids with AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 that blocks the CXCR4 receptor. Consistently throughout the six-day culture, this treatment reduced proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model that lacks CXCL12 (Figure 3A). Next, we treated the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium of CAFs. This stimulation elevated the proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 3B). In both cases, our analysis showed minimal statistically significant differences between the treated and non-treated co-culture models. Collectively, these results established that greater proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model than the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroid model was due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling.(A) Treatment of CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids with AMD3100 (CXCR4 antagonist) normalizes proliferation to level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture. (B) Treating CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium from CAFs stimulates proliferation to that of CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids.Evaluation of cancer cell growth in spheroids due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingThe above study based on metabolic activity of cells provided a measure of stromal-cancer cells signaling effect on the overall growth of spheroids. Considering that activated stromal cells (CAFs) in breast tumors also proliferate, we investigated to what extent greater overall growth results from proliferation of CXCR4+ TNBC cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids compared with other spheroid models shown in Figure 2A. Measurements of the endogenous eGFP signal of the cancer cells showed that cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display a statistically significant (p < 0.05) growth increase throughout the measurement window (Figure 4A). Linear regression analysis showed that CXCR4+TNBC cells in this model had an 11.4% larger growth slope over time than their counterparts in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. This indicates that CAFs confer increasingly greater proliferative activity to the breast cancer cells. To validate this result, we evaluated growth of cancer cells in co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs that lacked both elements of the signaling axis or CXCR4 receptor expression, respectively. Despite some random differences in growth of cancer cells between the two models on several days, the slope of linear regression was smaller by 2% in the co-culture containing CAFs (Figure 4B). Thus, these results established the role of CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling on enhanced growth of breast cancer cells.Proliferation of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids measured using their endogenous eGFP signal(A) TNBC cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display consistently greater proliferation compared to spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture model and CXCR4+TNBC single culture with a larger slope of 11.4% and 77.1%, respectively. (B) TNBC cells lacking CXCR4 expression in co-culture with HMF and CAFs show a similar proliferation. (C\u2013D) Morphology of resulting co-culture spheroids and mono-culture spheroids of breast cancer cells on days 1, 3, and 6 (left to right). Error bars represent standard error of mean. (E\u2013F) Confocal images of the co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells on day 4. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.TNBC cells in all four co-culture spheroid models displayed a larger growth than their respective mono-culture spheroids generated with the same density of 5 \u00d7 103 breast cancer cells. The slope of linear regression of growth curves was 5.0 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and TNBC:CAFs co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. Similarly, the regression line slope was 4.4 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and TNBC:HMF co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. This implies a major role for heterotypic cellular signaling in tumors and suggests that breast cancer cells induce the normal fibroblasts to produce soluble factors to promote growth of malignant cells. Studies show that cancer cells produce growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) that activate the adjacent stromal cells, which in turn secrete signaling molecules such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to promote proliferation of cancer cells. The larger growth rate of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids compared to the respective CXCR4+TNBC mono-culture spheroids may be mediated by soluble factors secreted by CXCR4-expressing cancer cells to transform HMF cells to CAFs.Morphologically, mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and TNBC became more compact by day six of culture. Co-culturing breast cancer cells and fibroblasts significantly enhanced compactness of spheroids earlier, indicating that fibroblasts facilitate spheroid formation of breast cancer cells (Figure 4C\u20134D). The co-culture models containing CXCR4+TNBC cells exhibited a compact morphology for several days with minimal increases of volume (9\u201315%) from days 1 to 3. But over time, the co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and HMF cells showed separation of fibroblast and cancer cells with an 82% volume increase from days 3 to 6. This is likely due to the expression of incompatible junctional proteins in breast cancer and fibroblast cells. For example, it was shown that intercellular adhesion was dependent on cadherins expression of each cell type, and only cells that expressed the same type of cadherins intermixed. Notably, the separation behavior was observed considerably more in the TNBC:HMF co-culture model and was further demonstrated through confocal imaging in Figure 4E\u20134F. Expression of CXCR4 on TNBC cells largely prevented separation from HMF cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. Additionally, inclusion of CAFs, regardless of CXCR4 expression on TNBC cells, blocked the segregation effect and helped the spheroids retain a compact morphology, mimicking the unique characteristic of CAFs to infiltrate tumor masses. All spheroids displayed shedding of TNBC cells from their peripheries on later days of culture, suggesting that active proliferation of border cells is somewhat compensated by cell shedding. We note that a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these morphological differences in co-culture spheroids requires a more extensive analysis.Molecular analysis of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on cancer cell proliferation in spheroidsWe evaluated proliferation of both breast cancer and stromal cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids using IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids and quantifying Ki-67+ proliferative cells. Breast cancer and stromal cells showed statistically significant higher proliferation (p < 0.05) in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 5). When co-cultured with CAFs, the CXCR4+TNBC cells showed 1.4 times greater Ki-67 staining, in agreement with results based on eGFP signal measurements (Figure 4). Additionally, CAFs in the co-culture model had a remarkably two-fold higher Ki-67 staining compared to HMF cells. This is consistent with increased proliferation of CAFs in tumor tissues, and the overall greater stromal content in more aggressive and larger tumors. We note that the CAFs secrete mCherry-tagged CXCL12 into the medium, whereas the HMF cells contain mCherry signal in their nuclei. This is the reason for visual differences between the red fluorescence images of CAFs and HMF cells in Figure 5. To avoid relying on the mCherry signal for quantification of cell proliferation, we used the Ki-67+ and eGFP signal of breast cancer cells to quantify proliferative TNBC cells, and then subtracted this value from the total Ki-67+ fluorescence to quantify proliferation of stromal cells (CAFs or HMF) in their respective co-cultures.Proliferation of CXCR4+TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HMF and CAFs) in co-culture spheroids characterized through measurements of Ki-67+ proliferative cells using immunostained images of cryosections of 4-day old spheroids. Both cancer cells and fibroblasts show significantly greater proliferation in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model (blue bars). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Next, we investigated molecular mechanisms for increased proliferation of stromal and breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 axis may activate multiple pathways in cancer cells. We focused on ERK and AKT, two prominent drivers of proliferation in breast cancer and other malignancies. Western blot analysis relative to the total protein and \u03b2-actin expression of each co-culture system showed that cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids had moderately higher levels of p-ERK (Figure 6A) and substantially higher levels of p-AKT (Figure 6B) compared to CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. The displayed immunoblots were quantified (normalized to their respective total and \u03b2-actin protein expressions), showing an 81% increase in the p-AKT/t-AKT levels and a 16% increase in p-ERK/t-ERK levels in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids. Although p-ERK increase is modest, small changes in activation of MAPK components produce much larger effects on overall signaling and biologic outputs. These results suggest that the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling upregulates activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways to support TNBC cells metabolic and growth activities.Western blot analysis of signaling proteins (A) p-ERK and (B) p-AKT in co-cultures of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF and CAFs. Quantified data were normalized to \u03b2-actin protein expression.To further substantiate these results, we conducted IHC analysis of cryosections of co-culture spheroids for ERK and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 7A\u20137B, 7D\u20137E). Quantification of immunostained sections (normalized to total protein expression and highest fluorescent value obtained) showed a similar pattern to Western blotting with a 52% and 28% increase in p-AKT/t-AKT and p-ERK/t-ERK levels, respectively, in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 7C, 7F). We note that high levels of ERK and AKT at the periphery of immunostained sections is due to the positioning of CXCR4+TNBC cells at the periphery of the co-culture spheroids. Fibroblasts were mainly distributed in the center of the sections and showed minimal staining, clear from the composite image in Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Movie 1. Therefore, quantification was only performed on the CXCR4+TNBC cells of stained sections.Cryosections of co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (green) with HMF and CAFs immunostained for (A\u2013B) ERK and (D\u2013E) AKT. A blue fluorescent secondary antibody was used to detect ERK and AKT. Images represent spheroids on day 4 of culture. Quantification showed higher (C) ERK and (F) AKT phosphorylation in the CXCR4+TNBC cells when co-cultured with CAFs. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Drug sensitivity of stromal-cancer cells co-culture spheroidsBiochemical interactions of activated stromal cells and cancer cells are suggested as a major cause of drug resistance. To demonstrate the effect of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on drug response of breast cancer cells, we evaluated the sensitivity of co-culture spheroids to a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, to which TNBC patients may develop resistance. Cancer cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids were significantly more resistant to paclitaxel at a 0.1\u201310 nM concentration range than cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids (p < 0.01). The largest difference in cancer cell viability (36%) occurred at a drug concentration of 1 nM (Figure 8). This demonstrates the impact of activated tumor stromal cells on chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells, consistent with several other reports, and that our 3D tumor models recapitulate stromal-mediated drug resistance. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 eliminated resistance to paclitaxel of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model. This result emphasizes the potential to improve response to chemotherapy by targeting the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling.CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids (blue bars) display resistance to paclitaxel treatment but lose resistance to the drug when co-treated with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 (gray bars), similar to the negative control counterpart (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). Images reflect spheroids at the end of drug treatment period (6 days). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.01.To understand the mechanism of paclitaxel resistance, we performed IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids to assess ERK and AKT activity in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF models treated with 1 nM paclitaxel. Following treatment, significantly higher phosphorylation levels of both proteins were maintained in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (p < 0.05), indicating that resistance to paclitaxel due to the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling is mediated by activation of these kinase pathways (Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure 3). Previous studies showed that paclitaxel resistance strongly correlated with increased activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in breast cancers, supporting our data. Upon co-treatment of spheroids with 1 \u03bcM of AMD3100, phosphorylated levels of ERK and AKT in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model treated with paclitaxel normalized to that of control CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. These results collectively demonstrate the promising therapeutic approach of sensitizing TNBC tumors to chemotherapy treatment by disrupting the cancer-stroma signaling and its downstream pathways to overcome stroma-induced cancer cell growth and chemotherapy resistance.Immunohistochemical analysis of drug-treated spheroids indicates that increases in AKT and ERK phosphorylation levels in CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids contribute to paclitaxel resistance (blue bars). Co-treatment with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist, AMD3100, lowers AKT and ERK activities (gray bars) to that observed in the paclitaxel sensitive control culture (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). *p < 0.05.Our findings suggest that greater proliferation and drug resistance of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model is due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling through AKT and ERK. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of these kinase pathways may block enhanced growth of cancer cells and compromise their viability. We treated both co-culture spheroids with specific inhibitors of MEK/ERK (PD0325901) and PI3K/AKT (PI-103) at a wide concentration range for a six-day period. Effectiveness of the inhibitors was assessed by eGFP detection of breast cancer cells in treated groups relative to their respective negative control group (no treatment) and presented as percent cell viability. We found that breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model were more sensitive to PD0325901 treatment below 100 nM (Figure 10A) and PI-103 treatment below 1 \u00b5M (Figure 10B). We further confirmed the reduction in breast cancer cell viability using quantification of fluorescence images of drug-treated spheroids in Figure 10C\u201310D. The largest differences in the viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs and HMF were 23% and 27% at 1 nM of PD0325901 and 0.1 nM of PI-103, respectively. Interestingly, PI-103 at a 0.1 nM concentration reduced breast cancer cell viability in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to 56%. This was consistent with protein expression results that showed significant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Figure 6 and 7) leads to increased growth of the breast cancer cells (Figure 4). This also agrees with a study that showed CXCL12 signaling-mediated drug resistant cancer cells became substantially more sensitive to chemotherapy through AKT inhibition. At higher concentrations, the MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor is more effective and reduces the cancer cells viability to less than 10%. Overall, the results corroborate our protein expression study that showed upregulated activity of these two kinase pathways due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling. Although CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 can potentially activate multiple pathways in cancer cells, these results establish signaling to MAPK and PI3K pathways in TNBC cells and the promising result of targeting these pathways to improve cytotoxicity. Considering the activation of both kinase pathways due to this signaling, their simultaneous inhibition using combination treatments with specific molecular inhibitors of AKT and MAPK pathways may result in synergistic inhibition of TNBC cell growth and survival at lower drug concentrations than those with single-agent treatments. Collectively, these results strongly support the utility of our 3D tumor models for cellular and molecular studies of tumor-stromal interactions.Viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with HMF and CAFs treated with a MEK inhibitor, (A) PD0325901, and a PI3K inhibitor, (B) PI-103, measured using the endogenous eGFP signal of the TNBC cells. CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs show greater drug sensitivity to the molecular inhibitors. Images reflect spheroids at end of drug treatment period (5 days). Error bars represent standard error of mean. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.In conclusion, our robotic technology allowed facile generation of co-culture spheroids to conveniently study stromal-cancer (TNBC) cells interactions. We found that CXCL12 from CAFs signaled through CXCR4 on triple negative cancer cells to significantly enhance TNBC cell proliferation. Additionally, CAFs showed greater proliferation than their normal HMF counterpart. Increased proliferation of TNBC cells occurred due to activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, two known effectors of CXCR4 signaling. CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling also conferred resistance to chemotherapy. We demonstrated the potential to overcome stromal-mediated drug resistance using small molecule inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways and CXCR4 signaling. Altogether, these findings highlight the power of our model system to identify promising new therapeutic strategies to improve response to therapy in TNBC. Future studies with improved tumor models should address and distinguish effects of stromal cells-deposited ECM signaling and stromal cells-mediated biochemical signaling with cancer cells on the proliferation and drug response of cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) preparationTwo polymers, BioUltra polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Sigma), MW: 35 kDa, and dextran (DEX) (Pharmacosmos), MW: 500 kDa, were utilized to form an aqueous two-phase system, as described previously. Briefly, PEG and DEX were added to the complete cell culture medium at 5.0% (w/v) and 12.8% (w/v), respectively. The polymers were dissolved using a vortex mixer and then incubating in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The polymer solutions were then stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Prior to use, the PEG phase polymer solution was filtered by passing it through a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter to remove any impurities.Cell cultureThree different triple negative breast cancer cells were utilized for experiments. The cell lines were: MDA-MB-231 (labeled TNBC), MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR4 receptor (labeled CXCR4+TNBC), and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR7 receptor (labeled CXCR7+TNBC). These cells were previously stably transduced using lentiviral vectors and the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cancer cells was confirmed through flow cytometry. The TNBC cells were additionally stably transduced to express eGFP for detection. In addition, a human mammary fibroblast (HMF) cell line (labeled HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein was utilized. HMF cells were also stably transduced to secrete 0.75 ng/ml/hr of CXCL12-\u03b1 fused with mCherry for tracking, and the resulting cells were labeled as CAFs. CAFs extracted from breast cancer patients secreted varying amounts of CXCL12 in media ranging from 0.9 ng/ml \u2013 2 ng/ml over a 48 hr time period, depending on the patients and the tumor samples. The higher CXCL12 secretion rate of our transduced HMFs accounts for medium renewals and drug additions that consequently dilute the CXCL12 concentration in the medium. To maintain the cells in culture, they were grown in T175 flasks at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 using Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). Once a confluent monolayer formed, cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma) and dissociated using 5 ml trypsin (Life Technologies) in an incubator for \u223c2 min. The cells were then neutralized with 10 ml of the complete growth medium, collected, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was aspirated, cells were resupsended in 1 ml of fresh medium, and loaded into a hemocytometer for counting.Co-culture spheroid formation using aqueous two-phase system (ATPS)A ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells was used to form co-culture spheroids that model the high stromal content often observed in larger and more advanced human breast tumors. Our initial tests with 1:3 and 1:4 ratios (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial TNBC cell density constant did not make any further changes in the growth of cancer cells. Therefore, the selected ratio of 1:2 (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) was used for all the studies. To prepare for forming spheroids, 30 \u03bcl of the PEG phase solution was dispensed into each well of a 384-well plate, labeled as the destination plate. The DEX phase solution was mixed at an equal volume with a specific density of cells (1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monoculture spheroids of TNBC cells, 2 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monocultures spheroids of HMF and CAFs, and 3 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF and TNBC-CAFs). The DEX phase solution and the cell suspension became diluted in half upon mixing resulting in a final polymer concentration of 6.4% (w/v), and densities of 5 \u00d7 103/0.3 \u03bcl TNBC cells in monoculture spheroids, 1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl HMF cells or CAFs in monoculture spheroids, and 1.5 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl in co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF cells or TNBC-CAFs. A source 384-well plate was prepared by loading the wells from a single column with \u223c20 \u03bcl of the solution of mixed DEX phase and cell suspension. A robotic liquid handler (Bravo SRT, Agilent) was programmed to mix the source plate content and aspirate 0.3 \u03bcl from each well. This solution was robotically dispensed as a single drop into each well of the destination plate containing the PEG phase. This process was repeated for all columns of the destination plate. After completion, the destination plate was placed in an incubator to allow cells to aggregate into a single spheroid in each well within 48 hrs. Our studies used a total of eight co-culture models: TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC: HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. Images of co-culture spheroids were captured using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) equipped with a high-resolution camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss).Robotic media exchange of co-culture spheroidsAfter forming spheroids, the cell culture medium in microwells was robotically exchanged to fresh medium containing only \u223c1% FBS. This was to ensure minimizing the effect of serum on cell growth and capture the effect of paracrine stromal-cancer cells signaling. The medium exchange was performed by three consecutive robotic dispensing and aspirating of 40 \u03bcl of the medium containing 1% FBS. This reduced the FBS concentration in the microwells from that of the complete growth medium to a very low level of \u223c1%. Therefore, the co-culture spheroids were maintained in \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of experiments. The medium exchange also diluted the PEG and DEX polymer concentrations and resulted in a single medium phase. The ATPS was not necessary at this point as it was only used for spheroid formation. The liquid handling protocol was optimized to avoid loss of spheroids during the process of medium exchange. Following this step, spheroids remained in 70 \u03bcl of homogenous \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of culture and without any further medium exchange.Evaluation of metabolic activity of co-culture spheroidsThe growth of co-culture spheroids was evaluated for a six-day period for all eight co-culture models using a standard PrestoBlue metabolic activity assay (Invitrogen). The PrestoBlue reagent contains a resazurin compound that is reduced by metabolically active, viable cells to resorufin detectable with standard plate readers at excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively. We have previously optimized the PrestoBlue assay for use with spheroid cultures. The resulting raw fluorescence data from all eight co-culture spheroids were normalized to the highest fluorescent readout obtained in the experimental data over the six-day period. Data from replicates (n = 14) of each co-culture model were then averaged and statistically evaluated to select certain co-culture models for further studies.Statistical analysis of growth of co-culture spheroidsStatistical analysis was performed on the metabolic activity of co-culture models using a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Briefly, the data represented measured signals from eight different co-culture models over six days. For each model on each day, there were 14 experimental replicates that were repeatedly used over the six-day measurement period. Therefore, we selected one-way MANOVA for data analysis to account for the temporal dependency of the daily measurements with each spheroid from a given co-culture model. The data were tested in two steps: (i) to evaluate if a co-culture model was statistically different from the other models. This was done by testing the null hypothesis that none of the co-cultures was different from the other models; and (ii) to identify if the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was statistically different from the other seven models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs). This was done using seven pairwise comparisons to test the null hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model was not different from the other models.The first statistical test showed significant differences among the eight co-culture models. Next, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was selected for pairwise comparisons with the other seven models due to its higher levels of proliferation. We determined if greater proliferation in this model was statistically significant from the other co-cultures. The Bonferroni correction was utilized to control the family-wise error since this was a multiple testing problem. A significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05 was selected to determine significant differences between the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and every other co-culture model. But \u03b1 was first modified to \u03b1/m, where m accounts for the number of hypotheses made. In this analysis, the number of hypotheses was m = 7. Therefore, a corrected significance level of 0.007 was used to reject the hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was not different from all the other seven co-cultures.For experiments that contained only two or three co-culture models presented in other sections, a student\u2019s t-test in Microsoft Excel Software or two-way ANOVA in Minitab Software was utilized with a p < 0.05 representing statistical significance.Blocking and stimulating chemokine-receptor signaling in co-culture spheroidsTo further evaluate cell proliferation due to chemokine-receptor signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids, AMD3100 (Selleckchem) was used to block the signaling and CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium was used to stimulate the signaling. A stock solution of AMD3100 was prepared in distilled, sterile water at 5 mM and stored at \u201380\u00b0C according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The desired concentration of AMD3100 was prepared by serially diluting the stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After formation of spheroids in the PEG-DEX ATPS, the medium exchange was done by adding 40 \u03bcl of AMD3100 at a 1.75 \u03bcM concentration to wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of medium. This diluted AMD3100 concentration to 1 \u03bcM. The AMD3100 solution was renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh solution of AMD3100 at a 1 \u03bcM concentration.To induce signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids, the spheroids were treated with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium collected from a confluent monolayer of CAFs. The conditioned medium was extracted from the CAFs monolayer 24 hours after seeding to ensure that it contained high levels of nutrients and growth factors. The conditioned medium was added to co-culture spheroids through medium exchange and renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh conditioned medium. Metabolic activity of co-culture spheroids following inhibition (AMD3100 treatment) or stimulation (CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium treatment) was evaluated daily using PrestoBlue over the six-day culture period. Data were compared to the respective negative controls, i.e., co-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF for inhibition and CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs for stimulation) that were grown in 70 \u03bcl of 1% FBS-containing media without receiving any treatment. Daily measured raw data from the co-culture models over the six-day culture were normalized to the highest fluorescent value obtained and then used for statistical tests.TNBC cell growth in co-culture spheroidsThe growth of TNBC cells in the co-culture models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs) that were selected based on the metabolic activity analysis was further confirmed by measuring the endogenous eGFP in TNBC cells using a plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The results were compared to those of the monoculture spheroids (TNBC and CXCR4+TNBC). Each model had n = 14 replicates. Data from each model were normalized to an arbitrary fluorescent value of 8000 a.u. for ease of comparison among different groups. Background fluorescence from the mCherry-expressing stromal cells in the co-culture spheroids was subtracted from the measured signal of TNBC cells. Fluorescent images were captured using a confocal microscope (Fluoview, FV1000, Olympus).Immunostaining and quantification of proliferation of co-culture spheroidsTo validate and quantify cell proliferation of co-culture spheroids, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an established protocol. Co-culture spheroids were aspirated from microwells on day four and collected in 200 \u03bcl microcentrifuge tubes. Medium used for transferring spheroids was carefully removed from the microcentrifuge tubes and 100 \u03bcl of 4% formaldehyde was added to fix the spheroids for 10 minutes at room temperature. The spheroids were rinsed with 100 \u03bcl of PBS three times for 5 minutes to remove the formaldehyde. A 30% (w/v) sucrose solution was then added to remove water from spheroids and prevent crystal formation upon freezing. Once spheroids sank to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes, an equal volume (100 \u03bcl) of tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences) was added to each tube. Samples were kept at 4\u00b0C overnight. Frozen samples were prepared the following day by flash-freezing spheroids into biopsy-sized cryomolds with dry ice. The spheroids were embedded between two thin layers of tissue freezing medium while avoiding bubble formation. The frozen molds containing the spheroids were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.A cryostat (Leica CM 1850) was used to cryosection the spheroids to 10 \u03bcm-thick slices. Only the middle sections of spheroids were collected and assessed. Each slice was transferred onto Superfrost Plus microscopic slides (Fisher). The sections were stained using a standard immunostaining protocol with primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling including the proliferative cell marker Ki-67, phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan). A blue fluorescent secondary antibody (AMCA-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for detection to avoid interfering with the endogenous mCherry and eGFP signals in the stromal and TNBC cells, respectively. The endogenous eGFP fluorescence of TNBC cells was used to distinguish TNBC and stromal cells. An inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) was used to capture fluorescent images. Image processing and analysis were performed in ImageJ Software (NIH) to quantify expression of each blue-labeled protein. The TNBC cells of sections were found through binary conversion of the green channel images to select and outline only the eGFP-expressing TNBC cells. This TNBC cell outline was then overlaid on the blue channel images to measure the mean gray value of protein-expressing TNBC cells. For Ki-67 analysis, this value was then subtracted from the total mean gray value of blue channel images to determine the mean gray value of Ki-67+ stromal cells.Western blot analysis with spheroidsCo-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF) were harvested from microplates on day four and transferred into 50 mL conical tubes. After centrifuging down the samples, the supernatant was removed and spheroids were washed with PBS. Spheroids were lysed using 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer (50 mM tric-HCL, 150 mM NaCl 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4 \u00b1 0.2), a protease inhibitor (complete mini, Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitor (Life Technologies). Spheroids were sonicated (Vibra-Cell, Sonics) twice for five seconds at a 50% amplitude level to ensure complete lysis. A BCA quantification assay kit (Life Technologies) was then used to quantify the total protein concentration extracted from spheroids. Electrophoresis and electroblotting were performed by protein addition (20 \u03bcl) onto a 4\u201315% gel (Biorad) and then gel transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma) for 1 hour. Primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling for phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan) were prepared at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer, and incubated with membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour. The membranes were thoroughly washed prior to and following secondary antibody treatment and detected with an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) using a FluorChem E imaging system (ProteinSimple). Quantified protein expression data were normalized to their corresponding \u03b2-actin expression.Chemotherapy drug testing with co-culture spheroidsBoth CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids were subjected to (i) single treatment with a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel (Selleckchem), and (ii) co-treatment with paclitaxel and AMD3100, to evaluate drug responses of TNBC cells. A stock solution of paclitaxel was prepared in DMSO at a 23 mM concentration and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. For single drug treatment, paclitaxel drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 2X the desired concentration. The drug solutions were added to co-culture spheroids, resulting in a total media volume of 70 \u03bcl and diluting the drug concentration in half. For co-treatment of spheroids with paclitaxel and AMD3100, drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 3.5X the desired concentration and directly added (20 \u03bcl of each drug solution) to co-culture spheroids in wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of media. Paclitaxel was added at a wide range of concentrations (0.01 \u2013 1000 nM) while AMD3100 was used at a constant 1 \u03bcM concentration for co-treatments. Single-agent (paclitaxel) and co-treatment (paclitaxel and AMD3100) tests were conducted for six days. A small volume (5 \u03bcl) of concentrated AMD3100 (15 \u03bcM) was directly added to the co-treated spheroid cultures after 72 hrs of incubation to provide a fresh dose of 1 \u03bcM AMD3100. Each condition in drug treatment studies used 14 spheroids. After six days, the TNBC cell viability of drug treated co-culture spheroids was evaluated using their endogenous eGFP fluorescence. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to the respective negative control conditions (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability.Preparation of inhibitors and testing against co-culture spheroidsThe CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and CXCR4+TNBC: CAFs spheroids were treated with a MEK inhibitor, PD0325901 (Selleckchem), and a PI3K inhibitor, PI-103 (Selleckchem). Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared at a 50 mM concentration in DMSO and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. The desired inhibitor concentrations for experiments were prepared by serially diluting each stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After forming co-culture spheroids, the medium exchange was performed as previously described and 30 \u03bcl of an inhibitor solution (prepared at 2X desired concentration) was added to spheroids in the last renewal stage, diluting the inhibitor concentrations in half. A column of spheroids was left untreated and only received 30 \u03bcl of fresh 1% FBS-containing medium. Spheroids were incubated for 72 hrs and then treatments were renewed by direct addition of 30 \u03bcl of fresh inhibitor solutions (prepared at 1X desired concentration). The negative control conditions received 1% FBS-containing medium. The spheroids were incubated for an additional 48 hrs and viable TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids were detected using their endogenous eGFP with a plate reader. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to their respective negative controls (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability. The results obtained from plate reading were further confirmed by fluorescent microscopy (Axio Observer, Zeiss) followed by image analysis (ImageJ, NIH).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumour initiation and progression, possibly by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a series of cellular changes that is known to underlie the process of metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether CAFs and surrounding normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) are able to induce EMT markers and functional changes in breast epithelial cancer cells. Matched pairs of CAFs and NBFs were established from fresh human breast cancer specimens and characterised by assessment of CXCL12 levels, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels and response to doxorubicin. The fibroblasts were then co-cultured with MCF7 cells. Vimentin and E-cadherin expressions were determined in co-cultured MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as by western blotting and quantitative PCR. Co-cultured MCF7 cells were also assessed functionally by invasion assay. CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and expressed higher levels of \u03b1-SMA compared with NBFs. CAFs were also less sensitive to doxorubicin as evidenced by less H2AX phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis on flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V compared with NBFs. When co-cultured with MCF7 cells, there was greater vimentin and less E-cadherin expression as well as greater invasiveness in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CAFs compared with those co-cultured with NBFs. CAFs have the ability to induce a greater degree of EMT in MCF7 cell lines, indicating that CAFs contribute to a more malignant breast cancer phenotype and their role in influencing therapy resistance should therefore be considered when treating breast cancer.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

P values are reported as: ns, nonsignificant; *, P <\u00a0.05; **, P <\u00a0.01; ***, P <\u00a0.001; ****, P <\u00a0.0001.Continued.Continued.The relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC was estimated by expression profile clustering using classic CAF markers reported in previous studies, including ACTA2, FAP, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PDPN, THY1 and COL1A1. The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.  Biglycan correlates biological features and clinical outcomesThe correlation between BGN and immune features. a, Heatmap showing the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes. b, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and ESTIMATE stromal and immune scores. c, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and CIBERSORT-derived immune cell scores. Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

Tumor microenvironment is a whole system which includes tumor cells, stroma cells (such as, adipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, infiltrating immune cells) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the activated fibroblasts, which were named by Tlsty\u2019s group in the tissue of prostatic cancer in 1999, are the primary type of host cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were found in almost all solid tumor tissue (e.g. cancers of the colon, lung, liver, prostate, pancreas and gastric cancer), and play an assignable role in tumor development by cell-cell interaction or cross-talk with tumor cells through secreting growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, CAFs are thought to be \u201cthe dark side of coin\u201d in tumor development.In contrast to normal fibroblasts, CAFs have some of phenotypical and functional abnormality. These alterations of CAFs may be due to its stable gene expression changes. So, whole breast carcinomas stromal by microdissection were explored to analyze the gene expression profiling. These studies have led to new classifications and risk stratification of breast carcinomas into several molecular subtypes based on their gene expression signatures. The global gene expression in the stromal cells has also been shown to powerfully predict prognosis and treatment response. A variety of differences have been identified between breast carcinoma-associated stroma and its paired normal mammary stroma, primarily resulting in increased expression of cytokines (EGF, HGF PDGF, TLL-12, SSP-1, POSTN, CXCL-12, and CXCL14), extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (FBN1, FB2M, SPARC, ADRA2A and ADM) and proteases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-13). These factors were involved in cross-talk between stromal cells and tumor cells by directly or indirectly pattern to promote tumor cell proliferation, cell adhesion and invasion, ECM remodeling. Although, these studies give us the overall configuration of the tumor microenvironment, there are still poor on the role of each member in the tumor stroma, like CAFs, to contribute to the tumor development.Until most recently, the distinguishable features and gene expression profile of CAFs and NFs have been described in breast cancer by Bauer et al.. Their studies show that up-regulated WISP1, collagen type-X (COL10A) and TGF-\u03b2 isoforms in CAFs activate paracrine Wnt-1 signaling in human breast cancer cells or lead to abnormal ECM production in stroma separately. Loss of expression of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 may alter the hormonal milieu in breast carcinomas, and down-regulation of KLF4 participates in the differentiation of resting fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. However, there is still no systematic analysis of the intrinsic relationship between breast cancer CAFs function and its abnormal signaling pathway. The extreme complexity of breast cancer CAFs feature and its roles to tumor development are needed to be further investigated. Furthermore, whether these previous finding in CAFs derived from western country women are also existed in patients of other races.In light of these facts, the principal purpose of this work is to investigate the possible innate nature of biological and genetic heterogeneity between human breast CAFs versus matched NFs in Chinese women. We identified 824 differentially expressed genes: 809 of these were up-regulated, and 15 were down-regulated in CAFs, which included 8 cytokines. The abnormality of CAFs genes and its associated signaling pathways could be involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, signal transduction and protein transport, which were proved in CAFs of other tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we firstly discovered that the altered ATM signaling pathway, which was recently found related to reactive oxidative stress (ROS), is abnormally activation in the early stage of breast cancer. Cell cycle regulated signaling, such as P53 signaling pathway, RB tumor suppressor/checkpoint signaling, regulation of cell cycle progression by Plk3, Cdc25 and Chk1 regulatory pathway are identified to be changed in CAFs. A set of immune associated signaling are abnormality in CAFs, which include natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules. And more importantly, we found that CAFs would be able to promote breast cancer cell invasion under co-culture condition through up-regulated CCL18.Materials and MethodsTissue SamplesAll the human breast tumor tissues and its adjacent normal mammary tissues were collected at the time of surgical reaction at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. None of the patients received adjuvant therapy before surgery. Specimens used in this study were approved by the Ethics committees of Chongqing Medical University.Isolation and Culture of Primary FibroblastsTumor tissue and paired normal mammary tissues were washed 3 times with sterile PBS with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamycin). The tissues were minced with sterile scissors in a fresh sterile culture dish. After digestion with 0.1% collagenase type I (C0130, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 8\u201312 h, tissues were carefully pipetted up and down for a couple of times using culture medium. The mixtures were centrifuged and washed with DMEM to remove the fat and tissue debris. Then, the mammary tissues were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Australia) for about two days. Removed the suspending cells or tissue, the most adherent cells were fibroblasts. The primary fibroblasts isolated from tumor tissues were named \u201cCAFs\u201d, and from tumor paired normal tissues named \u201cNFs\u201d. Cell purity was identified by immunohistochemistry for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence staining for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP following the standard described process previously and manufacture\u2019s protocols. Briefly, cells were grown on cover slips for 24 hours and fixed within 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1% triton-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1\u2236150) for targeting fibronectin (F3648, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam Cambridge) and FAP (ab53066, Abcam Cambridge, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) at 4\u00b0C for overnight. After washing with PBS, cells were then stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1\u2236100, ZF-0311, Zhongshan Goldenbrdge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and DAPI. Immunofluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80 i microscope (Eclipse 80 i, Tokyo, Japan; magnification\u00d7100).MTT and Flow Cytometric AnalysisCell growth was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Cells were plated into 96-well plate at 5\u00d7103 cells per well in 200 \u00b5l of complete growth medium. Cell growth was measured every day. Incubating for the designed time, MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. After careful removal of the medium, 0.1 ml of isopropanol with 0.04 N of HCl was added to each well, and the plates were shaken on a rotator for 20 min at room temperature. The absorbance was recorded on an ultraviolet spectrophotometric reader at a wavelength of 570 nm. The independent experiments were repeated for five times.S-phase was analyzed by using laser scanning cytometry. Cells were processed by standard methods using propidium iodide staining of cell DNA as previously described. A minimum of 20,000 events was collected to maximize the statistical validity of the compartmental analysis. Triplicate independent experiments were done.Preparation of Conditioned MediumMDA-MB-231 cells, CAFs and NFs were cultured in complete growth DMEM for 48 h to approximately 80% confluence. The medium was changed to 0.5% FBS DMEM and cells were kept in culture for another 30 to 36 h. For neutralization experiments, neutralizing antibodies against human CXCL-12 (500 ng/ml), CCL18 (10 \u00b5g/ml), CCL4 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) and control IgG (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were separately preincubated at 37\u00b0C with supernatant for 1 h before performing migration assays. The medium was centrifuged at 1,200\u00d7g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM).Cell Migration and Invasion AssayCell invasion or migration assay was measured via modified Boyden chamber assay as described previously. Briefly, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 cells in 200 \u00b5l serum-free medium were seeded in the wells of 8 \u00b5m-pore membrance modified Boyden chambers (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) coated with ECM (1\u22367.5) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 10% FBS Medium, CM, CM with secreting factor CXCL-12 (100 nM), CCL18 (500 ng/ml) or CCL4 (100 nM) was separately added into the lower or upper chamber as the designed purpose. After 6 h or 12 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C and CO2 at 5%, cells adhered to the upper surface of the filter were removed using a cotton applicator. Stained with hematoxylin in methanol, the invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were counted. The data represent at least three experiments done in triplicate (mean\u00b1standard error).RNA Isolation, Quantitative Real-time PCR and Microarray AnalysisTotal RNA isolated from six paired CAFs and NFs using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA quantity was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometry. Probe synthesis and hybridization performed as the manufacture\u2019s instruction were used to probe the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (44 K; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data were generated after scanning by using an Agilent Scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.5 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The raw data were normalized using quantize normalization and then analyzed by GeneSpring GX v10.0 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Paired Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) was applied to identify differentially expressed mRNA in CAFs and NFs. SAM output was filtered by q\u200a=\u200a0.1. Heatmap.2 function (R v2.14.0, gplots package v2.9.0) was used to plot the scaled expression data of differentially expressed mRNAs.An additional two expression datasets (GSE20086 and GSE29270) on breast cancer associated fibroblasts were downloaded from the GEO website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The raw data of six matched CAFs and NFs in GSE20086 were normalized using the R package gcRMA, GCRMA normalized. The author\u2019s processed data of 15 matched CAFs and NFs in GSE29270 were used in next analysis. Paired SAM were also used to analysis the different expression genes in CAFs versus NFs. In cytokines analysis process, the genes at least fold change >1.5 with an estimated FDR<10% were considered as dysregulated genes.RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). To confirm the differential gene expression pattern revealed by microarray analysis, 9 of randomly selected genes (CDC6, FLI1, S100A9, CDK1, PLK1, MMP9, PECAM1, SHC2 and C9ORF135) were re-proved by qRT-PCR assay. Specific Real-time PCR primers for each of selected genes were listed as Table 1. qRT-PCR was performed by a Bio-Rad CFX Manager instrument (Applied Biosystems) at 94\u00b0C for 15 Sec, Tm\u00b0C for 20 Sec and at 65\u00b0C for 30 Sec using SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II (Takara, Dalian, China). GAPDH were used as internal control for normalizing different samples.Primer sequences for qRT-PCR.Gene\tForward 5\u2018\u20133'\tReverse 5\u2018\u20133'\tSize (bp)\t \tFN\tAACTTCCTGGTGCGTTACTCA\tTGTGCTCTCATGTTGTTCGT\t156\t \t\u03b1-SMA\tGAGGCACCCCTGAACCCCAA\tATCTCCAGAGTCCAGCACGA\t153\t \tFAP\tTGTTCCAGCAATGATAGCC\tCTGCTTTCTTCTATATGCTCC\t186\t \tCDC6\tCCAGGCACAGGCTACAATCAGT\tACACGAGGAGAACAGGTTACGG\t126\t \tS100A9\tGCACCCAGACACCCTGAACC\tACCCTCGTGCATCTTCTCGT\t211\t \tFLI1\tCCACCCTCTACAACACGGAA\tATGTTATTGCCCCAAGCTC\t166\t \tCDK1\tGGATCTACCATACCCATTGAC\tTGGCTACCACTTGACCTGT\t120\t \tPLK1\tAATTACATAGCTCCCGAGGTG\tAGCCAGAAGTAAAGAACTCGTC\t118\t \tMMP9\tTCCCTGGAGACCTGAGAACC\tGGCAAGTCTTCCGAGTAGTTT\t307\t \tPECAM1\tACTCAAATGATCCTGCGGTA\tACTTAACATTTTGGCATGGGA\t98\t \tSHC2\tGCACCTGTATGTCAACACCCA\tTCCTCAAAGGGTCGCATGTCA\t90\t \tC9ORF135\tTCCCATGGATAGCCTTGACA\tGTGCCAGGAATACACCAAC\t160\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \tCCL18\tCCGCCTCGTCTATACCTCC\tCACTTCTTATTGGGGTCAGC\t141\t \tCCL4\tTTCCTCGCAACTTTGTGGTA\tCAGGTCATACACGTACTCC\t140\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \t\nNote: FN, Fibronectin; \u03b1-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle actin; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; CDC6, cell division cycle 6 homolog; S100A9, S100 calcium binding protein A9; FLI1, Friend leukemia virus integration 1; CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; PLK1, polo-like kinase 1; MMP9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; PECAM1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule; SHC2, SHC transforming protein 2; C9ORF135, chromosome 9 open reading frame 135; CXCL12, chemokine ligand 12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1);CCL18, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18; CCL4, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4.ELISA AssaySupernatant from NFs or CAFs were harvested and subjected to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for measuring the immunoreactive levels of CXCL-12, CCL18 and CCL4 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the instructions as supplied by the manufacturer. The ELISA assay was carried out in duplicate in three separate experiments.Gene Ontology and Pathway AnalysisFor detection of significantly over-represented GO biological processes, the Onto-Express analysis tool was used and the permutated P-value cut-off was set below 0.05. The pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs was conducted through the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool and the significantly changed signaling pathways were selected based on P<0.01.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was done using SPSS standard version 13.0 software. Data was shown as means \u00b1 SD from at least three independent determinations. Significance of difference was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant differences.ResultsIsolation and Identification of CAFs and NFsCAFs and their paired NFs were successfully isolated from six primary breast carcinomas and from adjacent normal breast tissue. The primary fibroblasts were successfully cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Both CAFs and NFs could be grown for at least 10 passages. Both CAFs and NFs showed spindle-like morphology (Fig. 1A). But the senescence-like cell would be appeared when the cell culture was more than 6 passages (Data not shown).Characterization of fibroblasts isolated from human breast tissue samples.A. Representative cell morphology of CAFs and NFs. B. Identification of CAFs using fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, and CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP by immunofluorescence staining. C. The biomarker gene expression in CAFs and NFs was re-proved by qTR-PCR, and its relative fold change in CAFs and NFs was displayed. The CAFs and NFs are positive for fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP are high expression in CAFs (magnification 100\u00d7 (cell morphology); 200\u00d7 (Biomarker immunofluorescence staining).The purity of CAFs was identified by fibronectin, which is the fibroblast biomarkers, and CAFs-specific biomarkers including \u03b1-SMA and FAP, respectively. NF and CAFs were positive for fibronectin, more than 95% of CAFs were stained by \u03b1-SMA and FAP (Fig. 1B). These biomarker expression changes were reproved by qRT-PCR in 3 paired of CAFs and NF (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrated that the purified CAFs were isolated from tumor tissue.The Noticeable Heterogeneity of Proliferation, Migration and Invasion between CAFs and NFsThe cell growth assay revealed that CAFs were endowed a significantly growth rate than that of NFs in the same culture conditions (P<0.05; Fig. 2A). The percentage of cells in the S phases measured by flow cytometry was significantly higher in CAFs (33.3\u00b17.1, N>3) compared with NFs (6.6\u00b12.5, N>3) (P<0.05). These data suggested that CAFs had a stronger capacity for proliferation than their paired NFs (Fig. 2B\u2013C). Similarly, CAFs had strong potent ability of migration (Fig. 3A\u2013B) and invasion (Fig. 3C) than its paired NFs.Significant difference of proliferation between CAFs and NFs.A.

(**P<0.01), (magnification A. 100\u00d7; C. 200\u00d7).CAFs Stimulate Tumor Cell Growth, Migration and InvasionIn order to understand the interaction cross-talk of CAFs with tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, co-culture system was employed to display their role in the cell proliferation and invasion. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from NFs (NFs CM) and control, MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from CAFs (CAFs CM) had significant proliferation (P<0.05; Fig. 4A) assayed by cell growth curve. The proportion of MDA-MB-231 cells in the DNA synthesis (S) phase cultured in CAFs CM (29.8\u00b10.8, N\u200a=\u200a3) was obviously more than that in NFs CM (13.0\u00b12.2, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.01) and control (23.5\u00b11.4, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.05) (Fig. 4B\u2013C). Collectively these studies demonstrate that CAFs had a stronger capacity promoting tumor cell proliferation than their paired NFs in the breast tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the increasing cell invasion was found in the co-culture system of MDA-MB-231 cells with CAFs CM, as compared with the system containing NFs CM or control medium (Fig. 5A\u2013D).CAFs promote proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in co-culture system compared with NFs.A.

The histogram to show the average migrated cells each view (F). Data is representative of 5 views (**P<0.01), (magnification: A, B 100\u00d7; E 200\u00d7).To examine whether tumor cells play a role in the biologic behavior of fibroblasts in the stroma, the effect of MDA-MB-231 on the migration of CAFs and NFs was compared. As predicted, more migrated cells were tested in the co-culture of CAFs and CM from MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 5E\u2013F). These data indicated that different effects existed in the cross-talk of tumor cells and fibroblasts.Genes Differentially Expressed between CAFs and NFsTo reveal the essence of the heterogeneity of biologic characteristic between CAFs and NFs in the breast carcinoma microenvironment, gene expression profile was investigated by micro-array assay. Total RNA derived from six paired CAFs and NFs isolated from primary breast infiltrating ductal carcinomas of grade \u0399\u0399 were used in this analysis. Gene expression profiles of pooled CAFs and their pooled normal counterparts were obtained by microarray analysis using the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (Fig. 6A). A total of 25,206 probe sets (transcripts) were present in human breast carcinomas-derived fibroblasts relative to their normal controls. Compared with the expression profile of NFs, 809 up-regulated genes (0.9%) and only 15 down-regulated genes (0.45%) were detected in CAFs using an arbitrary cutoff line of signal log ratio of \u22651.8 or \u2264\u22121.8. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), cell division cycle 6 homolog (CDC6); Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1); S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), matrix metallo peptidase 9 (MMP9), and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) were predominantly over-expressed at high levels in CAFs whereas SHC transforming protein 2 (SHC2) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 135 (C9ORF135) were down-regulated with a high array intensity (Table S1 and Table S2).Gene heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs.A. HeatMap of gene expression data obtained by Agilent micro-arrays analysis from CAF and NF isolated from all six cases (BCa 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were subjected to unsupervised cluster analysis. B. The mRNA levels of 9 genes selected randomly were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C. Signaling pathway analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathway in CAFs vs. NFs.The up-regulated genes encoded for secreted proteins were mostly classified into groups of extracellular region, cell proliferation, and signal transducer activity (Table S3). To validate the microarray data, the expression level of 9 randomly selected genes including 7 of up-regulated genes and 2 of down-regulated genes were re-proved by qRT-PCR between CAFs and NFs (Fig. 6B). Compared with NFs, the expression pattern of all differentially expressed genes in CAFs detected by qRT-PCR was consistent with the microarray results.The Unanimity Heterogeneity of Biological Characteristics and Genes Expressed in CAFsMicroarray assay displayed that most genes up-regulated in CAFs have oncogenic function, including growth factors (FGF2, VEGFC, PDGFC, CASC5, and HGFAC), transcription regulators (MKX, RUNX3, ATAD2, FOXM1, and PTTG1), cell proliferation-associated genes (CENPF, PLK1, BUB1, KIF15, and CRIP1) and members of the Wnt signal pathway (WNT1, WNT5A, LRP6, TCF4, and GBP4). Several genes encoding secreted proteins, such as CCL18, CXCL12, MCM10, ADAMDEC1, MMP9, and S100A9 were also significantly up-regulated in CAFs (Table S3). All of these secreted proteins are able to induce cell proliferation, implying that CAFs play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells.Additionally, microarray results suggest that CAFs may facilitate invasion and metastasis of breast tumor cells. The data listing in Table S1 shows that CAFs promote tumor cell invasion mainly via two of mechanisms: (a) altering tumor microenvironment interactions (tumor-stroma and tumor-tumor) by increasing cell adhesion (PECAM1, ITGAX, CCL4, LPP, and SIGLEC8) and cell-cell interaction signaling (CCL18, DLGAP5, C1QA, STAB1, and TEK), and (b) promoting extracellular region degradation (LYZ, C1QB, MMP9, IGLL1, and IGHG1) surrounding tumor cells (Table S3).Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathways showed that CAFs enriched many serviceable signaling pathways in contrast to NFs in human breast cancer. Maximum change pathways in CAFs were cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathways associated with cell cycle. Compared with NFs, the cell cycle and DNA replication signal pathway in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times, respectively. The alteration of the ATM signaling pathway was absolute significantly. It was recently reported that the ATM signaling was activated under oxidative stress. Our preliminary data indicated that activated ATM signaling was in responsible for cell proliferation of fibroblasts (Data not shown). The change of other pathways was also assignable, such as DNA replication signal pathways, chemokine signaling pathways, PI3k signaling pathways, abnormal activated p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 6C). Herein, the heterogeneity of genes expressed between CAFs and NFs was consistent with their heterogeneity of biological characteristics.The Common Cytokines-CCL18 Obtained by Compared with Published Microarray DataTo compare the shared genes in current work with previous publication in breast cancer CAFs, the mRNA microarray data of breast cancer CAFs and its paired NFs stored in National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE20086 and GSE29270) were used. As shown in Fig. 7, the dysregulated genes of CAFs are 136 (M Bauer), 1339 (M Basik), and 1102 in current work, respectively. The shared dysregulated genes among each of these data were 12 (Bauer\u2019s data vs. Basik\u2019s data), 7 (Local data vs. Bauer\u2019s data), and 93 (Local data vs. Basik\u2019s data). These data indicate that high heterogeneity is indeed existed in the CAFs of breast cancer. The similarity was found for cytokines and chemokines genes in the CAFs. The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained in comparing the current data with Basik\u2019s microarray data.The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained by compared with published microarray data.The number of dysregulated difference genes and shared genes from current work and two other studies in breast cancer associated CAF versus paired NF was displayed in each group. Dysregulated Cytokines in each study were listed. Only the common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained compared local data with Basik\u2019s microarray data (GSE29270).CAFs Provide a Suitable Microenvironment for Tumor Cell InvasionImmune-related genes, including various chemokines (CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18), are also differentially expressed in CAFs (Fig. 6C and 8A). Chemokines secreted by stromal cells surrounding tumor tissue have been associated with tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis through cross-talk between tumor and stromal cells. To understand whether CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18 involving in the cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells, tumor cell invasion was analyzed in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231, or NFs and MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 8B and 8D, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 immunoneutralizing antibody in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 reduced tumor cell invasion by nearly 60%. However, Condition medium (CM) with neutralizing antibody CCL4 had no significantly affect on tumor cell invasion. On the other hand, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 ligand, not CCL4 ligand in the co-culture system of NFs and MDA-MB-231 enhanced transmigration of tumor cells by around 3-fold (Fig. 8C and 8E). Collectively, these studies indicate that the up-regulated chemokine genes in CAFs have contributed to suitable microenvironments for tumor cell invasion.CCL18 and CXCL12 secreted by CAFs promote tumor cell invasion in cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells.A. The mRNA levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. B. The protein expression levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by ELISA in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C-F. Transwell migration assays were used to determine the functional significance of cytokines secreted by CAFs on tumor invasion. Assays were conducted by using either immunoneutralizing antibody (C and E) or addition of ligands (D and F) in the co-culture system. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u200a=\u200a3 separate experiments (**P<0.01), (magnification 100\u00d7).DiscussionCancer-associated fibroblasts have been recognized for their impact on the carcinogenesis, promotion and progression of many carcinomas. Breast cancer is notoriously associated with tumor microenvironment stroma with activated fibroblasts. However, relatively little is known about the relationship of biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs in the stroma of human breast carcinoma. Herein, this study focused on the gene expression profile of human breast cancer-derived fibroblasts in order to reveal the molecular mechanism of how fibroblasts induce a favorable microenvironment to cancer development.CAFs had several pivotal biological characteristics compared with NFs in human breast cancer. Using the CAFs and its paired NFs isolated from breast cancer tissue, the proliferation, migration and invasion of CAFs themselves were memorably higher than that of NFs in breast cancer. And CAFs had the potential capacity for the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Furthermore, the invasion ability of CAFs and breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 could significantly be increased under the co-culture system of tumor cells and CAFs or NFs cells.In line with the finding of the biological difference between CAFs and NFs, the heterogeneity of genes expression profiles and signal pathways were highly consistent with the biological characteristics of CAFs and NFs. The huge heterogeneity of gene expression was found between CAFs and NFs (Table S1 and S2). For example, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and cancer susceptibility candidate 5 (CASC5) took part in the regulating proliferation of CAF itself and tumor cell.Compared with NFs, over-expressed genes in CAFs afford several interesting insights into the dynamics of the carcinoma microenvironment through the special GO Catalogue. The gene ontology and signaling pathway analysis showed that the cell cycle and cell cycle regulated signaling pathways in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times respectively, compared with NFs. Traditionally, p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were cancer suppressor gene, but p53 signaling pathway abnormal activated and over-expressed of BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATR in CAFs may involve in other function in the tumor microenvironment. Similarly, ATM signaling pathway and cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathway may be related to cell proliferation in response to oxidative stress, although they were in responds to DNA damage or DNA strand break in traditionally. These data demonstrated that the vigorous proliferation of CAFs than NFs by some special activated signal pathway. However, the details will be further study for our next work.Moreover, the different invasion capacity between CAFs and NFs may be supported by other sets of genes expression (e.g. FOXM1, MMP9, PTTG1, IGHG1, TM4SF19, S100A9, SDCBP) in the CAFs and NFs. Heterogeneity of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1) were involved in cancer invasion and migration. In breast cancer, the securin protein stability of PTTG1 was correlated with securin accumulation. Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (IGHG1) and transmembrane 4 L six family member 19 (TM4SF19) were related to tumor immune invasion mechanisms and then made the tumor cells immunity. S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9) has been revealed as the metastasis-inducing protein. Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP) was reported involving in cancer metastatic progression. These results support the function of fibroblasts in breast carcinoma to promote cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis.Furthermore, CAFs recruited numerous cells related with tumor angiogenesis, infiltration, which promoted the tumor invasion and metastasis, through secreted some special chemical chemotactic factors. For example, CXCL14 derived from CAFs in prostate cancer and SDF1/CXCL12 derived from CAFs in breast cancer called up macrophages, endothelial cells derived from bone marrow source, M2 mononuclear cells to the tumor tissue respectively, which assisted the tumor formation new blood and lymph vessels. Chemokine signaling pathway and PI3k signaling pathways enriched in CAFs also illustrated that CAFs could promote itself and the cancer cell invasion and migration. These studies suggest that a close and frequent crosstalk between the CAFs and tumor cells exists during tumor invasion and metastasis process.In addition, a set of signaling associated with immune response, activation or immune escape were found in this study. For example, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules are abnormality compared with NFs. Although, its roles in the microenvironment to promote tumorigenesis and/or development for breast carcinoma are keeping study, these finding in current work indicate that CAFs may involve in immune response and/or immune escape of tumor cell.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer associated fibroblasts: the dark side of the coinBreast cancer stem cells, cytokine networks, and the tumor microenvironmentBreast cancer\u2013one term, many entities?Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts promotes the proliferation of a lingual carcinoma cell line by secreting keratinocyte growth factorCancer-associated orthotopic myofibroblasts stimulates the motility of gastric carcinoma cellsRole of cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts in metastatic colon cancer to the liver and their expression profilesCasbas-Hernandez P, Fleming JM, Troester MA (2011) Gene Expression Analysis of In Vitro Cocultures to Study Interactions between Breast Epithelium and Stroma.

Upon interaction with cancer cells, quiescent resident fibroblasts, which are the predominant cell type in normal stroma, are transformed into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) which become a major component of the tumor stroma. CAFs promote cancer cell invasion, proliferation, and metastasis by secreting cytokines and chemokines, which stimulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and EMT programs. Moreover, CAFs secrete a distinctive extracellular matrix that promotes the attachment and invasion of tumor cells. Several steps of the bi-directional signaling between cancer cells and fibroblasts have been elucidated. Neoplastic cells secrete cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1\u03b2 to activate fibroblasts and stimulate their proliferation. The CAFs, in return, secrete cancer activating chemokines such as SDF-1\u03b1, thereby stabilizing and promoting tumorigenesis. However, it is currently not clear how cancer cells reprogram quiescent fibroblasts to become CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at a posttranscriptional level. miRNAs are powerful regulators of cellular differentiation, since they affect the expression of many genes and are deregulated in cancer cells. Presently, it is not clear whether endogenous miRNAs are involved in the conversion of resident fibroblasts to CAFs. Several reports have demonstrated that miRNAs can reprogram various somatic cells to become pluripotent stem cells. A combination of miR-124 and the transcription factors MYT1L and BRN2 reprograms primary human dermal fibroblasts into functional neurons that exhibit typical neural morphology, fire action potentials, and produce functional synapses. miR-15 and -16, are downregulated in fibroblasts surrounding prostate tumors but their functional role in promoting tumor growth is unclear. Recently, miR-511-3p has been reported to prevent the tumor-promoting activity of tumor associated macrophages.Epithelial serous ovarian carcinoma (OvCa) has a unique pattern of metastasis which remains largely restricted to the abdominal cavity, in which the omentum, a large fat pad in front of the bowel, is a major site of colonization. Ovarian tumors and metastases have a substantial stromal component of which CAFs are an important constituent. Though the role of CAFs in ovarian cancer progression is well established, the mechanism of CAF formation remains unclear.While most miRNA studies have focused on the tumor cell, little is known about miRNA expression in the tumor microenvironment. Given the broad regulatory role of miRNAs, we have now investigated whether miRNAs are involved in the reprograming of normal fibroblasts to CAFs, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. We report here that a combination of three miRNAs induce normal human omental fibroblasts to become CAFs, leading to the upregulation of chemokines important in invasion and metastasis.RESULTSIdentification of miRNAs Deregulated in Cancer Associated FibroblastsThe miRNA expression in CAFs was compared with that in primary human normal omental fibroblasts (NOFs) using two independent, unbiased approaches. In one approach, primary human CAFs were isolated from the omental metastases of patients with metastatic serous OvCa and compared to tumor adjacent NOFs extracted from a normal area of the omentum, at least 1 inch from the tumor, from the same patients. In the other approach, NOFs from the omentum of cancer-free patients operated on for benign gynecologic disease (e.g. fibroids) were compared to NOFs co-cultured with HeyA8 OvCa cells (Fig. 1A). While the former approach identifies the miRNA changes that occur during tumor progression, the latter detects the early changes induced exclusively by cancer cells. Confocal time-lapse microscopy revealed that CAFs were more migratory (Supplementary Fig. S1A,B) and induced the invasion of different OvCa cell lines more efficiently, than either NOFs or tumor adjacent NOFs (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The induced CAFs, generated by a 7-day co-culture of NOFs with OvCa cells, had an enhanced ability to promote tumor cell invasiveness (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that cancer cells impart CAF-like properties to these cells.Therefore, the miRNA expression of CAFs was compared to that of adjacent NOFs and the miRNA expression of NOFs was compared to that of induced CAFs (Fig. 1A). A miRNA array analysis of RNA isolated from these cells identified 19 significantly expressed miRNAs that were upregulated (p<0.05) and 15 miRNAs that were downregulated in the co-cultured, induced CAFs (Table S1). Of these miRNAs, one was found to be upregulated and four downregulated in CAFs compared to matching adjacent NOFs from six patients with postmenopausal, advanced, serous ovarian carcinoma (Fig. 1B and Table S1). In both induced CAFs and primary patient-derived CAFs, the miRNAs that were most significantly up- and downregulated were miR-155 and miR-214, respectively, and were selected for further testing. miR-31 was included because it was the second most significantly downregulated miRNA in induced CAFs and because it was reported as downregulated in fibroblast cell lines derived from patients with endometrial cancer. Using quantitative real-time PCR, downregulation of miR-31 and miR-214 and upregulation of miR-155 was confirmed in all CAF and induced CAF samples (Supplementary Fig. S3A). In situ hybridization of an omental metastasis from a patient with OvCa confirmed that the expression of miR-214 was lost in CAFs and high in adjacent NOFs; an opposite expression pattern was observed for miR-155 (Supplementary Fig. S3B).Reversible Conversion of Normal Fibroblasts into CAFsTriple transfection of NOFs with anti-miR-31, anti-miR-214, and pre-miR-155 (miR-CAFs) enhanced fibroblast migration as well as the invasion and colony formation of co-cultured HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 cells (Fig. 1C-E), suggesting that deregulating the expression of the three miRNAs could convert NOFs to CAFs. The reverse was also true, since transfection of CAFs with pre-miR-31, pre-miR-214, and anti-miR-155 reduced their migration, and also reduced the invasion and colony formation of co-cultured OvCa cells to levels similar to those of OvCa cells co-cultured with NOFs (Fig. 1C-E). miRNA transfection was validated by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4A,B). To assess the contribution of each of the miRNAs to the functional effects of miR-CAFs on cancer cells (migration, invasion, colony formation) NOFs or CAFs were transfected with individual miRNAs or their inhibitors. miR-214 was active in regulating fibroblast migration and cancer cell invasiveness, miR-155 predominantly affected cancer cell invasiveness, and miR-31 affected colony formation of the cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A-F).To test the in vivo activity of the identified miRNAs, miR-CAFs or NOFs transfected with scrambled RNA were co-injected with luciferase expressing HeyA8 cells subcutaneously into mice. Co-injected CAFs were used as a positive control. Both miR-CAFs and CAFs significantly enhanced the growth of tumor cells when compared to NOFs (Fig. 1F) which was also reflected in increased expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 1G). This growth enhancement was a direct effect of fibroblasts on tumor cells because the number of infiltrating macrophages or neutrophilic granulocytes was similar in all experimental groups (Fig. 1G and data not shown).Chemokines are the Most Highly Deregulated Genes in CAFs, Induced CAFs and miR-CAFsTo determine whether altering the expression of the three miRNAs in NOFs to generate iCAFs mimicked the differentiation of NOFs into CAFs in patients, tumor-adjacent NOFs and CAFs were subjected to gene array analysis. These data were compared to the gene expression profile obtained from miR-CAFs, which were re-programmed NOFs derived from patients without cancer through transfection with anti-miR-214/31 and pre-miR-155. The successful transfection of the miRNAs/miRNA inhibitors and their functional effects on fibroblasts was confirmed using PCR and invasion assays (data not shown). Table S2 lists the genes that were upregulated >1.5 fold in the two CAF preparations (when compared to adjacent NOFs from the same patients) and in miR-CAFs (when compared to matching NOFs). Surprisingly, seven of the ten most highly upregulated genes were chemokines. Most of these chemokines were also found to be upregulated when CAFs were compared to NOFs and miR-CAFs to adjacent NOFs (Table S3 and data not shown).In order to determine the extent of the reprogramming by miRNAs we compared gene expression changes between patient-derived CAFs, induced CAFs, and miR-CAFs and their respective normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). The overlap in induced gene changes between miR-CAFs and CAFs was 15.3% compared to 23.2% between induced CAFs and CAFs. Interestingly, only 13 genes were upregulated and 4 genes downregulated in the CAFs, induced CAFs and miR-CAFs from all patients, and, again, the top three upregulated genes were chemokines (Fig. 2B). The upregulation of these chemokines on the mRNA level was confirmed by qRT-PCR for each array analysis (Fig. 2C).Identification of CCL5 as a Target of miR-214To determine whether miR-CAFs, generated by altering miRNA expression, secreted chemokines, a protein array was constructed for ten of the most highly upregulated cytokines found on the gene array. In this assay the most highly induced chemokine on the protein level was CCL5/RANTES followed by CXCL10, CCL7, and CCL8 (Fig. 3A). To understand how miRNAs regulate expression of chemokines in CAFs, we analyzed the 3\u2032-UTR of all 9 chemokines upregulated in miR-CAFs and CAFs for possible miRNA seed matches using miRanda, TargetScan, and PicTar software. Only one chemokine was predicted to contain seed matches for any of the 3 miRNAs. Overlapping seed matches for miR-214 and miR-31 were found in the CCL5 3\u2032-UTR (Fig. 3B).While triple transfected NOFs secreted the most CCL5, anti-miR-214 was most efficient in inducing expression of CCL5 when transfected alone (Fig. 3C), suggesting that CCL5 is a direct target of miR-214. Luciferase constructs were used with the CCL5 wild-type 3\u2032-UTR and two different CCL5 3\u2032-UTR mutants with substitutions in the miR-214 or the miR-31 seed matches (Fig. 3B). Co-transfection of miR-214 or miR-31 into 293T cells, together with the luciferase constructs, showed that miR-214 was more potent in targeting the CCL5 3\u2032-UTR than miR-31 (Fig. 3D), and this activity was greatly diminished when the miR-214 seed match was mutated. This was confirmed for endogenous miRNAs by transfecting the reporter constructs into either primary CAFs or NOFs. Luciferase activity was significantly reduced in miR-214/miR-31 high expressing NOFs when compared to CAFs, with the miR-214 site mutant showing the greatest loss of repression (Fig. 3E). Consistent with miR-214 targeting CCL5, an alignment of the 3\u2032-UTRs of human, mouse, and rat CCL5 revealed that the region of highest identity contains the seed match for miR-214, while the sequence for miR-31 is less well conserved (Supplementary Fig. S6).CCL5 is Critical for the Activity of both CAFs and miRNA Reprogrammed CAFsTo determine the in vivo relevance of CCL5 in the activity of miR-CAFs, miR-CAFs were generated by transiently transfecting NOFs with anti-miR-31, anti-miR-214 and pre-miR-155. Using an orthotopic OvCa mouse model, luciferase expressing HeyA8 cells were co-injected with the miR-CAFs into the ovaries of nude mice and tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S7A). Reprogrammed fibroblasts clearly increased the growth of co-injected HeyA8 cells, an effect that could be blocked by injections with a neutralizing anti-CCL5 antibody. This indicates that the CCL5 secreted by miR-CAFs is a key tumor promoting factor. To determine the in vivo significance of CCL5 in the activity of patient isolated CAFs, luciferase expressing HeyA8 cells were co-injected orthotopically with either NOFs or CAFs (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S7B). The neutralizing anti-CCL5 antibody again inhibited the augmented growth of HeyA8 promoted by co-injected CAFs. The histology of the ovaries from mice co-injected with either NOFs, miR-CAFs or CAFs (Fig. 4C) showed that all tumors were invasive, high-grade and were primarily composed of cancer cells. Tumor cells co-injected with either miR-CAFs or CAFs showed increased invasive growth replacing normal ovarian structures such as follicles and fallopian tube more efficiently compared to co-injected NOFs. The cancer cells in both the miR-CAF IgG and CAF IgG group had more Ki-67 staining (Supplementary Fig. S7C-D) indicating increased proliferation which could be inhibited by the anti-CCL5 antibody. Consistent with the histologic analysis of the subcutaneously injected tumors (Fig. 1G) there was no difference in infiltrating immune cells (data not shown).Our data suggest that CCL5 is an important factor in the provision of a tumor promoting environment for OvCa cells. However, the in vivo experiments did not exclude the possibility that CCL5 acted by enhancing the conversion of NOFs to CAFs rather than by affecting the cancer cells. To test this, a novel homing assay was developed where matrigel plugs containing the different fibroblasts were placed equidistantly in the same culture dish and overlaid with media containing fluorescently labeled OvCa cells. Two OvCa cell lines were attracted by NOFs co-transfected with both anti-miR-31 and anti-miR-214 (Fig. 4D and E) as well as to induced CAFs (Fig. 4F), an effect that was inhibited by the neutralizing CCL5 antibody. These data suggested that CCL5 acts by binding to one of its cognate receptors (CCR1, 3 and 5) on the surface of the cancer cells. Analysis of a data set comparing OvCa samples and normal ovarian surface epithelial cells revealed that CCR1 is upregulated in primary OvCa (data not shown). Consistently, we found CCR1 to be expressed in both HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A) and treatment of the OvCa cells with the CCR1/3 inhibitor J113863 blocked the homing of either HeyA8 or SKOV3ip1 cells to NOFs transfected with anti-miR-214 and anti-miR-31 (Fig. 4G and H). Finally, ectopic expression of CCL5 in NOFs (Supplementary Fig. S8B) significantly increased their ability to promote HeyA8 cell co-invasion an effect blocked by a CCL5 neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4I).DISCUSSIONWhile the cancer-promoting role of CAFs is unambiguously established, it is less clear how quiescent fibroblasts are transformed into CAFs. We tackled this question with two complementary approaches; comparing primary human fibroblasts from patients with and without OvCa and a 3D organotypic co-culture model. The results indicate that the downregulation of miR-214 and miR-31 and the upregulation of miR-155 can rapidly reprogram normal fibroblasts into CAFs. These three miRNAs combined are able to activate tumor promoting functions including migration, invasion and colony formation in normal fibroblasts. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report which shows that three miRNAs cooperate in reprograming quiescent fibroblasts into cancer growth promoting active fibroblasts, suggesting that resting fibroblasts possess the plasticity to become CAFs.Our data suggest that CCL5 is a miRNA regulated candidate effector molecule in CAFs, contributing to tumor cell recruitment and growth. CCL5 is abundant in the serum of OvCa patients with advanced, metastatic disease. It is also secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which have similar functional properties to fibroblasts. Of note, the overexpression of CCL5 in fibroblasts was sufficient to promote the metastasis of admixed breast cancer cells in a manner similar to our results, which demonstrated that contact with CCL5 transfected NOFs increased the invasion of OvCa cells.CAFs at least partially maintain their characteristics when cultured in the absence of malignant cells, suggesting that genetic or epigenetic alterations have occurred. While genetic alterations have been reported in CAFs from breast and ovarian cancer, careful analysis demonstrated that such genetic alterations are extremely rare. It is more likely that the stable phenotype of CAFs is regulated by epigenetic changes, as suggested by a genome wide analysis of breast cancer stroma. Our results also lend support to a model in which tumor cells directly reprogram normal residential fibroblasts to become CAFs in the absence of permanently acquired mutations by changing miRNA expression in the fibroblasts (Fig. 4J). The tumor promoting role of CAFs together with their genetic stability makes them an attractive therapeutic target in treatments aimed at removing tumor-supporting factors from the microenvironment. The model for miRNA induced NOF \u2192 CAF transformation presented here opens the possibility of a treatment approach targeting the tumor stroma with miRNA and miRNA inhibitors.METHODSAdditional methods are included in the supplementary methods.Fibroblast Isolation and CharacterizationCAFs were isolated from tumor transformed omentum and adjacent NOFs from the normal part of the omentum. All patients had newly diagnosed advanced, metastatic high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and were undergoing primary debulking surgery by a gynecologic oncologist at the University of Chicago. NOFs were from omentum of female patients undergoing surgery for benign reasons. CAFs, adjacent NOFs and NOFs were isolated as described. CAFs were characterized by the expression of \u03b1\u2013SMA which was not expressed by the aNOFs or NOFs (Supplementary Fig. S9A-C). The miR-CAFs did not express \u03b1\u2013SMA which was expected as it is not a target of the three miRNAs used to reprogram NOFs. Of note, \u03b1\u2013SMA is not expressed in all CAFs even though these CAFs are functionally active. CAFs activity was validated through functional experiments (increased invasion, migration, colony formation, tumor growth when co-injected with OvCa cells in vivo). Induced (i)CAFs were generated by coculture of NOFs with OvCa cells and miR-CAFs were generated by transfection with LNA anti-miR-214, anti-miR-31 (Exiqon), and pre-miR-155 (Ambion).Cell LinesHuman ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3ip1, OVCAR5, and HeyA8 were were validated by STR DNA fingerprinting using the AmpF\u2113STR Identifier kit (Applied Biosystems) and compared to known ATCC fingerprints, the Cell Line Integrated Molecular Authentication database (CLIMA), and the MD Anderson fingerprint database.MicroRNA and Gene Array AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated and subjected to both miRNA array (miRCURY LNA array, v. 10.0, Exiqon) and gene array analyses using GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). All gene array data are available through GEO (accession numbersGSE35364).Invasion and MigrationFibroblasts labeled with CMTPX (Invitrogen) and GFP expressing tumor cells were mixed and seeded in 96-well glass bottom plates coated with growth-factor reduced Matrigel\u00ae. Thereafter, upward invasion of cells through Matrigel\u00ae towards DMEM with 10% FBS was followed with time lapse confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S2). The speed of the invading cancer cells was analyzed with Imaris Software (Bitplane Inc., Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland). Migration was quantified using transwell assays.Plug-homing AssayNOFs transfected with anti-miR-214 and 31 or with equimolar scrambled controls were mixed with 20 \u03bcl growth factor reduced Matrigel\u00ae. Plugs of anti-miR-214+31 or control transfected NOFs or matrigel alone were placed equidistant in the same culture dish. Alternately, plugs of induced CAFs or NOFs or matrigel alone were used. Homing of GFP labeled cancer cells towards the plugs was monitored using an Axio-observer A1 fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss) and quantified using Image J software (NIH).Xenograft ExperimentsNOFs (1\u00d7105 cells) transiently transfected with anti-miR-31, anti-miR-214, and pre-miR-155, or with the scrambled controls for each, were mixed with 0.5\u00d7105 HeyA8-Luc cGFP cells and then injected subcutaneously into the flanks of female athymic nude mice. Alternatively, 50,000 CAFs, NOFs, anti-miR-214, anti-miR-31 and pre-miR-155 transfected NOFs or scrambled control transfected NOFs were co-injected with 25,000 HeyA8-Luc cGFP cells into the right ovary of nude mice with 2 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 blocking antibody or nonspecific mouse IgG. Mice were subsequently injected with 1 mg/kg CCL5 antibody or IgG control i.p. 3 and 6 days, thereafter. Tumor growth was quantified using the Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System. Radiance was measured for tumors on each flank for the subcutaneous model. Total radiance from the tumors in each mouse was measured for the orthotopic, intraabdominal model. Significance was calculated comparing all groups using one way ANOVA.Supplementary MaterialThe authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.REFERENCESAccessories to the crime: Functions of cell recruited to the tumor microenvironmentExtracellular matrix: A gatekeeper in the transition from dormancy to metastatic growthCancer-associated fibroblasts and their putative role in potentiating the initiation and development of epithelial ovarian cancerStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis throught elevated SDF-1/CXCL 12 secretionThe functions of animal microRNAsMicroRNAs: Key players in the immune system, differentiation, tumorigenesis and cell deathDirect reprogramming of adult human fibroblasts to functional neurons under defined conditionsConverting human skin cells to neurons: A new tool to study and treat brain disorders?Control of tumor and microenvironment cross-talk by miR-15a and miR-16 in prostate cancermir-511-3p modulates genetic programs of tumor-associated macrophagesOvarian cancer development and metastasisThe autophagic tumor stroma model of cancer or \u201cbattery-operated tumor growth\u201d a simple solution to the autophagy paradoxThe role of miR-31 and its target gene SATB2 in cancer-associated fibroblastsGene expression profiling supports the hypothesis that human ovarian surface epithelia are multipotent and capable of serving as ovarian cancer initiating cellsElevated serum RANTES levels in patients with ovarian cancer correlate with the extent of the disorderAdult human fibroblasts are potent immunoregulatory cells and functionally equivalent to mesenchymal stem cellsMesenchymal stem cells within tumour stroma promote breast cancer metastasisBreast-cancer stromal cells with TP53 mutations and nodal metastasesFrequent gene dosage alterations in stromal cells of epithelial ovarian carcinomasNo evidence of clonal somatic genetic alterations in cancer-associated fibroblasts from human breast and ovarian carcinomasDistinct epigenetic changes in the stromal cells of breast cancersReconstruction of human mammary tissues in a mouse modelUse of a novel 3D culture model to elucidate the role of mesothelial cells, fibroblasts and extra-cellular matrices on adhesion and invasion of ovarian cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts are activated in incipient neoplasia to orchestrate tumor-promoting inflammation in an NF-kappaB-dependent mannerSIGNIFICANCEThe mechanism by which quiescent fibroblasts are converted into cancer associated fibroblasts is unclear.

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

        "content": "Tumors are supported by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are heterogeneous and carry out distinct cancer-associated functions. Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "content": "Many fibroblast-secreted proteins promote tumorigenicity, and several factors secreted by cancer cells have in turn been proposed to induce these proteins. It is not clear whether there are single dominant pathways underlying these interactions or whether they involve multiple pathways acting in parallel. Here, we identified 42 fibroblast-secreted factors induced by breast cancer cells using comparative genomic analysis. To determine what fraction was active in promoting tumorigenicity, we chose five representative fibroblast-secreted factors for in vivo analysis. We found that the majority (three out of five) played equally major roles in promoting tumorigenicity, and intriguingly, each one had distinct effects on the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin promoted breast cancer cell survival, whereas the chemokine CCL7 stimulated tumor cell proliferation while CCL2 promoted innate immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis. The other two factors tested had minor (CCL8) or minimally (STC1) significant effects on the ability of fibroblasts to promote tumor growth. The importance of parallel interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells was tested by simultaneously targeting fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin and the CCL7 receptor on cancer cells, and this was significantly more efficacious than blocking either pathway alone. We further explored the concept of parallel interactions by testing the extent to which induction of critical fibroblast-secreted proteins could be achieved by single, previously identified, factors produced by breast cancer cells. We found that although single factors could induce a subset of genes, even combinations of factors failed to induce the full repertoire of functionally important fibroblast-secreted proteins. Together, these results delineate a complex network of tumor-fibroblast interactions that act in parallel to promote tumorigenicity and suggest that effective anti-stromal therapeutic strategies will need to be multi-targeted.

        "full_text": "System-Wide Analysis Reveals a Complex Network of Tumor-Fibroblast Interactions Involved in TumorigenicityMany fibroblast-secreted proteins promote tumorigenicity, and several factors secreted by cancer cells have in turn been proposed to induce these proteins. It is not clear whether there are single dominant pathways underlying these interactions or whether they involve multiple pathways acting in parallel. Here, we identified 42 fibroblast-secreted factors induced by breast cancer cells using comparative genomic analysis. To determine what fraction was active in promoting tumorigenicity, we chose five representative fibroblast-secreted factors for in vivo analysis. We found that the majority (three out of five) played equally major roles in promoting tumorigenicity, and intriguingly, each one had distinct effects on the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin promoted breast cancer cell survival, whereas the chemokine CCL7 stimulated tumor cell proliferation while CCL2 promoted innate immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis. The other two factors tested had minor (CCL8) or minimally (STC1) significant effects on the ability of fibroblasts to promote tumor growth. The importance of parallel interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells was tested by simultaneously targeting fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin and the CCL7 receptor on cancer cells, and this was significantly more efficacious than blocking either pathway alone. We further explored the concept of parallel interactions by testing the extent to which induction of critical fibroblast-secreted proteins could be achieved by single, previously identified, factors produced by breast cancer cells. We found that although single factors could induce a subset of genes, even combinations of factors failed to induce the full repertoire of functionally important fibroblast-secreted proteins. Together, these results delineate a complex network of tumor-fibroblast interactions that act in parallel to promote tumorigenicity and suggest that effective anti-stromal therapeutic strategies will need to be multi-targeted.Author SummaryThere is increasing interest in developing methods to treat cancer by targeting non-cancer cells that play supportive roles in the tumor microenvironment. One type of non-cancer cell that has received considerable attention along these lines is cancer-associated fibroblasts, which can promote tumor formation and tumor growth. There have been several studies showing that inhibition of individual fibroblast genes or proteins dramatically reduces the tumor supportive function of fibroblasts. From the perspective of developing a therapeutic strategy, what remains unclear is whether the several different important factors discovered to date reflect the requirement of a multitude of fibroblast factors to promote tumorigenicity, or whether it reflects the diversity of the epithelial cancer cells and fibroblasts used in these different studies. Here, we addressed this question directly using a single system of fibroblasts and breast cancer epithelial cells. Importantly, we found that a multitude of fibroblast factors are indeed required to promote tumorigenicity, and that they have different effects on the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we found that inhibiting multiple fibroblast-secreted factors is more efficacious than blocking individual factors. These results suggest that fibroblasts and cancer cells act through multiple parallel pathways and that effective anti-stromal therapeutic strategies will need to be multi-targeted.IntroductionSolid tumors are aberrant tissues where stromal cell types co-develop with and influence cancer cells. Significant epigenetic alterations and gene expression changes occur in stromal cells as tumors progress, and the stromal changes are as strikingly different as those observed in the cancer epithelial compartments. Many of these stromal cell changes are elicited by factors secreted by cancer cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; MIM: 192240), which helps recruit and induce proliferation of endothelial cells. Cancer cells also secrete factors that alter surrounding fibroblasts, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 (MIM: 190180) which induces fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts and secrete collagen, thereby contributing to the abundant extracellular matrix often observed in epithelial tumors. In addition to TGF-\u03b2 factors secreted by cancer cells that influence stromal fibroblasts include platelet derived growth factor (PDGF; MIM: 173430), interleukin (IL)-6 (MIM:147620), IL1-\u03b1 (MIM: 147760), and WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein (WISP)-1 and -2 (MIM: 603398 and 603399).Tumor associated fibroblasts have been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, inflammation, invasion and metastasis. Several fibroblast-secreted or membrane-bound factors that mediate these effects have been identified, including CXCL12 (MIM: 600835), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; MIM:142409), matrix metalloproteinase MMP14 (MIM: 600754), osteopontin (MIM: 166490), TGF-\u03b2, and CCL2 (MIM: 158105).Some basic underlying processes involved in regulating the interactions between the epithelial cancer cells and the stromal fibroblasts have been identified. For example, several fibroblast-secreted factors are inflammatory cytokines whose expression is driven by NF-kappaB-dependent transcription in a process similar to the senescent secretory phenotype observed in aging fibroblasts. Additionally, a study of how fibroblasts co-evolve with tumor cells determined that fibroblasts gradually implement two signaling loops, involving TGF-\u03b2 and CXCL12, which act together through both autocrine and cross-signaling mechanisms. What remains unclear is whether the different factors involved in cancer cell-fibroblast interactions reflects a requirement of a multitude of fibroblast factors acting in parallel to promote tumorigenicity, or whether it reflects the diversity of the approaches and systems used to identity important interactions. Here, we designed a study to explore how the entire repertoire of fibroblast-secreted factors that are induced by human cancer cells function as a whole and compared the factors. This systems-level study was designed to be complimentary to approaches that focus on single genes or single processes. Our study indicates that the majority of induced fibroblast-secreted factors play a role in promoting tumorigenicity and that they do so through diverse effects on the tumor tissue.ResultsComparative genomic analysis of pro-tumorigenic fibroblast factors induced by breast cancer cellsWe adapted previously used systems of human cancer cells and fibroblasts, by using fibroblast lines that were amenable for the use of stable RNA interference (shRNA) so the relevance of candidate mediators of tumor-stromal interactions could be tested. We determined using co-injection assays that two human fibroblast lines previously shown to promote tumorigenicity in other systems (HFFF2 and HFF1) were able to promote tumorigenicity of two basal breast cancer subtype cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and Cal51, whereas two other human fibroblast lines (Wi-38 and CCD1112Sk) were not (Figure S1). We used the two tumor-supportive fibroblast lines (HFFF2 and HFF1) as models for patient-derived breast carcinoma associated fibroblasts and the two non-supportive fibroblasts as models for normal breast tissue derived fibroblasts. Using fibroblasts cell lines allowed shRNA transfection, selection and subsequent validation of gene silencing, whereas patient-derived breast fibroblasts cannot be passaged in culture long enough for such manipulations (data not shown; Ahmet Acar, personal communication). To determine at which point the host murine fibroblasts replaced the co-injected human fibroblasts, we tagged the human fibroblasts with green fluorescent protein (GFP) so that we could visualize how long they survived ensconced within developing tumors. We found that after three weeks, the number of co-injected GFP-tagged human fibroblasts comprised roughly 20% of the tumor stroma as judged by co-localization of GFP and the fibroblast stromal marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (Figure S2), but the relative contribution steadily declined from week 3 to week 8, although the GFP-fibroblasts never completely disappear. The level of \u03b1-SMA positive cells within tumor stroma persisted during this same time period (Figure S2).We performed transcriptional profiling and pathway analysis to determine if exposure of our model tumor-supportive fibroblasts to breast cancer cells in co-culture resembled expression changes seen in patient-derived breast carcinoma fibroblasts. We compared expression profiles of HFF1 and HFFF2 tumor-supportive fibroblasts co-cultured with either Cal51 or MDA-MB-231 (four combinations total) to those of Wi-38 and CCD1112Sk non-supportive fibroblasts co-cultured with either Cal51 or MDA-MB-231 (another four combinations). We chose to work with basal subtype breast cancer cell lines due to the greater need to develop new treatments for this poor prognosis subtype. We then compared the pathways selectively enriched in tumor-supportive fibroblasts co-cultured with Cal51 and MDA-MB-231 to pathways enriched by comparing cultures of patient-derived breast carcinoma fibroblasts to their normal counterparts. Strikingly, the top four pathways identified by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) that are activated by exposure of tumor-promoting human fibroblasts to breast cancer cells are also amongst the top ten pathways activated in cultures of patient-derived breast carcinoma fibroblasts relative to normal fibroblasts (Figure 1). These pathways are ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, integrin signaling and integrin cell-surface interactions; interrelated pathways that have been shown to be involved in the activation of cancer associated fibroblasts. Additionally, most of the other top ten activated pathways in both systems were activated in the other system at lower ranking but still significant levels. These pathways included cytokine cytokine-receptor interactions, PDGF signaling, and Rho GTPase signaling; which likewise have shown to be involved in activation of cancer associated fibroblasts (Figure 1). On the whole, the overlap in all significantly activated pathways is 44% (Table S1). This affirmed that this system of tumor-promoting human fibroblasts resembled in vitro cultures of patient-derived breast cancer fibroblasts.Comparative genomic analysis of expression changes induced by breast cancer cells in tumor-supportive fibroblasts, patient-derived carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, and microdissected breast stroma.(A) Top ten pathways identified by GSEA analysis of exposure of tumor-supportive fibroblasts to breast cancer cells; blue indicates overlap with the top ten pathways activated in patient-derived breast cancer fibroblasts; green indicates overlap with other pathways significantly activated in patient-derived breast cancer fibroblasts; grey indicates no overlap, (B) Top ten pathways identified by GSEA analysis of patient-derived breast cancer fibroblasts relative to their normal counterparts; blue indicates overlap with the top ten pathways activated by exposure of tumor-supportive fibroblasts to breast cancer cells; green indicates overlap with other pathways significantly activated by exposure of tumor-supportive fibroblasts to breast cancer cells; grey indicates no overlap, (C) Top ten pathways identified by GSEA analysis of microdissected breast cancer stroma relative to normal breast stroma, green indicates overlap with pathways significantly activated by exposure of tumor-supportive fibroblasts to breast cancer cells, but not in the top ten; grey indicates no overlap. (D) A tumor-supportive fibroblast gene signature was used in unsupervised clustering to classify normal (green) and tumor (red) microdissected breast stroma samples. (E) The same signature was used in principal component analysis to observe the separation of normal (green) and tumor (red) microdissected breast stroma samples.We next wanted to test whether this system also reflected changes observed in vivo in human primary breast cancer stroma. To address this, we used gene-set enrichment analysis to determine the pathways that were activated in microdissected human breast stroma relative to normal breast stroma. Despite the fact that human breast stroma contains many cell types in addition to fibroblasts, four of the eight significantly activated pathways in human breast stroma were also significantly activated by exposure of tumor-promoting fibroblasts to breast cancer cells, including cytokine/cytokine-receptor interactions and JAK-STAT signaling (Figure 1). Additionally, we developed a gene signature based on stimulation of tumor-promoting fibroblasts by breast cancer cells. Based on both clustering and principal component analysis, this gene signature was able to correctly predict whether microdissected human breast stroma was derived from cancerous or normal breast tissue for 98 of 99 samples (Figure 1). These comparative genomic analyses establish the close correspondence of our system of interaction of breast cancer cells with tumor-promoting fibroblasts to stroma and stromal fibroblasts isolated from primary human breast cancer.Determining the repertoire of fibroblast-secreted factors that are induced by breast cancer cellsWe used genome-wide analysis to determine the full repertoire of secreted factors induced by breast cancer cells in our tumor-promoting fibroblasts. As the first step, we compared genes induced in tumor-promoting fibroblast lines to genes induced in fibroblast lines incapable of promoting tumorigenicity. We found 320 genes that were more than 2-fold greater induced in tumor-promoting fibroblasts (Table S2) and within this group were 62 genes encoding secreted proteins. Of these, 42 were also significantly upregulated (p<0.05) in stromal cells isolated from primary breast cancer relative to normal breast stroma cells. This group contained cytokines (15), extracellular matrix proteins (7), proteases (6), and growth factors and hormones (6) (Table 1). Cytokines as a class were significantly enriched in our screen relative to their representation in the set of all secreted proteins (36% vs. 12%, p\u200a=\u200a5.6e-6). This enrichment is consistent with the prior reports that cytokines play key roles in the tumor-supportive function of tumor-associated fibroblasts. In contrast, the other functional classes of secreted proteins were not significantly enriched. The cytokines upregulated in tumor-supportive fibroblasts included CC- and CXC-chemokines (CCL-2, -5, -7, -8, -20, and CXCL-5, -10; MIM: 158105, 187011, 158106, 602283, 600324 and 147310 respectively), pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-1\u03b1, -1\u03b2, -8, -11, -24; MIM: 147760, 147720, 146930, 147681 and 604136 respectively), colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; MIM: 138970), interleukin receptor antagonist (IL1RN; MIM: 147679), and TNF superfamily member TNSF15 (MIM: 604052) (Table 1). Systematic literature searches revealed that 16 of the 42 secreted proteins had one or more publication(s) implicating them in the tumor-supportive function of fibroblasts while 26 did not (Table 1). The genes not previously implicated as mediators of the tumor-supportive function of fibroblasts included the majority (8/15) of cytokines, one-half (3/6) of the proteases, and the majority (4/6) of the growth factors and hormones. Examples include CCL8, encoding a chemokine not previously linked to cancer that is involved in homing of memory T lymphocytes to inflamed skin; pregnancy-associated plasma protein-a (PPAPA; MIM: 176385), a protease that degrades IGF-binding proteins and acts as a positive modulator of local IGF signaling in skin repair; and EGFL6 (MIM: 300239), encoding an epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat protein expressed in osteoblastic-like cells and capable of inducing migration of endothelial cells.Some of the fibroblast-secreted candidate tumor-supportive factors fall outside of the known classes of proteins involved in tumor-stromal interactions, including ISG15 (MIM: 147571), an interferon-inducible, ubiquitin-like protein whose secretion plays a critical role in mediating an effective immune response to mycobacteria; and complement component C3 (MIM: 120700), which in addition to its role in the complement cascade helps mobilize hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to wounds.42 secreted proteins selectively induced by breast cancer cells in tumor-promoting fibroblasts.Gene Symbol\tMIM ID\tDescription\tClass\tCancer Relevant Phenotype\tKnown pro-tumorigenic stromal fibroblast function\tReference (PMID)\t \tCCL8\t602283\tchemokine (C-C motif) ligand 8\tCytokine\tInflammatory\tNo\t21217759\t \tTNFSF15\t604052\ttumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 15\tCytokine\tSuppressive\tNo\t22833050\t \tCCL2\t158105\tchemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tYes\t22472119\t \tCCL20\t601960\tchemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tYes\t21847358\t \tCCL5\t187011\tchemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tYes\t21252118\t \tCCL7\t158106\tchemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tYes\t19937793\t \tCSF3\t138970\tcolony stimulating factor 3 (granulocyte)\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tNo\t12492491\t \tCXCL10\t147310\tchemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tNo\t17409450\t \tCXCL5\t600324\tchemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 5\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tYes\t19047182\t \tFST\t136470\tFollistatin\tOther\tOncogenic\tYes\t19740438\t \tIL11\t147681\tinterleukin 11\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tNo\t12842083\t \tIL1A\t147760\tinterleukin 1, alpha\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tNo\t9618523\t \tIL1B\t147720\tinterleukin 1, beta\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tYes\t20138012\t \tIL1RN\t147679\tinterleukin 1 receptor antagonist\tCytokine\tSuppressive\tNo\t21519029\t \tIL24\t604136\tinterleukin 24\tCytokine\tSuppressive\tNo\t20926331\t \tIL8\t146930\tinterleukin 8\tCytokine\tOncogenic\tYes\t22422937\t \tCOL7A1\t120120\tcollagen, type VII, alpha 1\tECM\tSuppressive\tYes\t22564523\t \tSPON1\t604989\tspondin 1, extracellular matrix protein\tECM\tOncogenic\tNo\t19549008\t \tTNFAIP6\t600410\ttumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 6\tECM\tAnti-inflammatory\tNo\t9244409\t \tDPT\t125597\tDermatopontin\tECM\tOncogenic\tNo\t16899568\t \tPOSTN\t608777\tperiostin, osteoblast specific factor\tECM\tOncogenic\tYes\t22158103\t \tVCAN\t118661\tVersican\tECM\tOncogenic\tYes\t19160015\t \tSPP1\t166490\tsecreted phosphoprotein 1\tECM\tOncogenic\tNo\t21252118\t \tAREG\t104640\tAmphiregulin\tGrowth factor\tOncogenic\tNo\t18470483\t \tEGFL6\t300239\tEGF-like-domain, multiple 6\tGrowth factor\tNone known\tNo\t\t \tSTC1\t601185\tstanniocalcin 1\tGrowth factor\tOncogenic\tNo\t20484106\t \tUCN2\t605902\turocortin 2\tGrowth factor\tSuppressive\tNo\t18308934\t \tNRG1\t142445\tneuregulin 1\tGrowth factor\tOncogenic\tYes\t22535374\t \tWISP1\t603398\tWNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1\tGrowth factor\tSuppressive\tYes\t21516124\t \tC3\t120700\tcomplement component 3\tOther\tHSPC recruitment\tNo\t16863905\t \tFAM20C\t611061\tfamily with sequence similarity 20, member C\tOther\tNone known\tNo\t\t \tFJX1\t612206\tfour jointed box 1 (Drosophila)\tOther\tNone known\tNo\t\t \tIGFBP5\t146734\tinsulin-like growth factor binding protein 5\tOther\tSuppressive\tNo\t21460855\t \tISG15\t147571\tISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier\tOther\tNone known\tNo\t\t \tPAPPA\t176385\tpregnancy-associated plasma protein A, pappalysin 1\tProtease\tOncogenic\tNo\t21303951\t \tPCSK1\t162150\tproprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1\tProtease\tOncogenic\tNo\t20052009\t \tSERPINB2\t173390\tserpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B (ovalbumin), member 2\tOther\tSuppressive\tNo\t1427403\t \tSPINT1\t605123\tserine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 1\tOther\tSuppressive\tNo\t16103220\t \tMMP1\t120353\tmatrix metallopeptidase 1 (interstitial collagenase)\tProtease\tOncogenic\tYes\t11990853\t \tMMP11\t185261\tmatrix metallopeptidase 11 (stromelysin 3)\tProtease\tBoth oncogenic and suppressive\tYes\t11990853\t \tMMP12\t601046\tmatrix metallopeptidase 12 (macrophage elastase)\tProtease\tOncogenic\tNo\t21378275\t \tMMP3\t185250\tmatrix metallopeptidase 3 (stromelysin 1, progelatinase)\tProtease\tOncogenic\tYes\t11990853\t \tResults of literature searches on the 42 secreted proteins selectively induced in tumor-supportive fibroblasts.

Consistent with a faster tumor growth rate, cancer cells in the co-injected tumors exhibited a two-fold higher proliferative rate based on Ki-67 labeling (Figure 2). To visualize and quantify the presence of three of the most important features of the tumor microenvironment - inflammation, vascularization and fibroblast activation - we performed immunohistochemical analysis at week six after co-injection. We used antibodies to the 7/4-antigen, which is highly expressed in neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, the CD31 endothelial antigen, which visualizes blood vessels, and \u03b1-SMA, which is expressed by activated fibroblasts. Strikingly, the presence of inflammatory cells, degree of vascularization, and number of activated fibroblasts were all 3 to 4 fold higher in the co-injected tumors (Figure 2), indicating a profound influence of tumor-supportive fibroblasts on the composition of the tumor microenvironment.Tumor-supportive fibroblasts have profound effects on the composition of the tumor microenvironment.(A) Tumor-supportive fibroblasts HFFF2 increase Cal51 tumor cell proliferation and increase stromal components (bottom panel) as compared to tumors formed using Cal51 alone (top panel).

Five different fields of three different tumors per group were scored. Asterisk indicates a significant difference between cell line only (Cal51shNT) and co-injection (Cal51shNT+HFFF2) groups (p<0.01). Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM. (C\u2013E) Similarly performed quantification of monocytes and neutrophils, endothelial cells, and activated mesenchymal cells (p<0.01).We decided to analyze a mix of previously implicated and novel candidate pro-tumorigenic fibroblast-secreted factors. Additionally, we wanted to test whether seemingly redundant factors were indeed functionally redundant. We focused on cytokines, growth factors, and hormones, and chose CCL2 and CCL7 (both previously validated as functionally important fibroblast secreted factors); the related factor CCL8 which, like CCL7, binds CCR1 (MIM: 601159); amphiregulin (AREG; MIM: 104640), which has been implicated in tumor stromal-interactions but as a ligand produced by cancer cells acting on fibroblasts; and stanniocalcin1 (STC1; MIM: 601185), which has been shown to act as a cancer cell autonomous factor, but not as a stromally produced factor. For each of these five genes, we confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR that there was a significant induction in the co-cultured tumor supportive fibroblasts relative to the co-cultured neutral fibroblasts (Figure S3). CCL2, CCL7 and CCL8 chemokines mediate tumor supportive abilities of fibroblasts with distinct effects on the tumor microenvironmentCCL2, CCL7, and CCL8 are structurally related chemokines that share a common function of recruitment of monocytes to areas of injury and inflammation. Based on their structural similarity and overlapping functions in inflammation, we wanted to determine if they had redundant roles in the tumor supportive function of co-injected fibroblasts. Remarkably, shRNAs directed against each of these three cytokines suppressed tumorigenicity in the co-injection assay, with the strongest effects observed when silencing CCL2 (53%) or CCL7 (66%) compared to weaker effects exerted by silencing of CCL8 (25%) (two validated shRNAs per gene, Figure 3). Interestingly, despite their related structure, silencing of each of the three cytokines had a distinct impact on the tumors: silencing of CCL2 suppressed recruitment of innate immune cells and angiogenesis (Figure 4) almost to the same levels as in tumors without co-injected fibroblasts. In contrast, silencing of CCL8 suppressed only the recruitment of innate immune cells, while silencing of CCL7 reduced tumor cell proliferation almost to the levels observed in tumors growing in the absence of co-injected fibroblasts (Figure 4 and Figure S4). Our data therefore showed that these related chemokines had non-redundant roles in mediating fibroblast-supportive functions.shRNA silencing of CCL2, CCL7 or CCL8 in tumor-supportive fibroblasts reduces their ability to promote tumorigenicity.(A) Reduction of CCL2 protein in HFFF2 fibroblasts by expressing shRNAs targeting CCL2 as indicated compared to non-targeting (N.T.) control determined by immunoblotting.

Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM.Suppressing AREG reduces the ability of fibroblasts to support tumorigenicityWe next tested whether silencing of AREG in fibroblasts affected tumor supportive function. Silencing of AREG had a pronounced effect, with an average reduction in tumor size at six weeks of 55% to 65% (Figure 5). In contrast to the chemokines, silencing AREG in fibroblasts had no effect on the number of blood vessels or innate immune cells (Figure 5). However, immunohistochemical analysis of the percentage of cells within the tumor that expressed \u03b1-SMA, a marker of mesenchymal-derived cells such as activated fibroblasts, revealed a 78% reduction. This level was comparable to the low levels of \u03b1-SMA positive cells in tumors formed in the absence of co-injected fibroblasts (Figure 5). Although \u03b1-SMA is expressed by activated pericytes, a cell type that surrounds endothelial cells of blood vessels, we did not observe a difference in number of \u03b1-SMA cells associated with blood vessels (Figure 5). This suggested that secretion of amphiregulin by the co-injected human fibroblasts plays a major role in establishing a tumor microenvironment that is enriched for activated fibroblasts, and since the co-injected human fibroblasts are almost entirely replaced by mouse fibroblasts at the point of excision (6 weeks), this effect must be propagated through recruited mouse fibroblasts. Consistent with this, we found that amphiregulin increased proliferation of mouse fibroblasts, as well as human fibroblasts (Figure 5). We also found that amphiregulin was a chemoattractant for mouse fibroblasts in migration and invasion assays, suggesting a mechanism of recruitment into the tumor, and that amphiregulin directly activated fibroblasts as judged by induction of \u03b1-SMA expression (Figure 6).Suppressing amphiregulin expression in tumor-supportive fibroblasts reduces tumorigenicity and amount of mesenchymal cells.(A) Reduced amphiregulin protein levels in HFFF2 fibroblasts expressing two distinct shRNAs directed against AREG compared to cells expressing non-targeting shRNA (immunoblotting). \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. shAREG-2 was more potent at suppression both by immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR (see also Figure S3).

(J) Effects of amphiregulin on the viability of Cal51 cells plated on non-adhesive plates and cultured for 24 hours (anoikis assay). Viability was determined by measuring calcein AM uptake. Asterisk indicates that the experimental group is significantly different than the control (p<0.05). Data are expressed as the percentage of viable cells normalized to control with the error bars representing SEM.In addition to the pronounced reduction of activated fibroblasts when AREG was silenced, we also noted changes in activation of the amphiregulin receptor EGFR (MIM: 131550) on tumor cells. Compared to tumor cells co-injected with control tumor-supportive fibroblasts, tumor cells when co-injected with AREG-silenced fibroblasts showed a <2-fold reduction of activated, phospho-EGFR as measured by immunohistochemistry (Figures 6). This was accompanied by a minor, barely significant (p\u200a=\u200a0.06), negative effect on tumor cell proliferative rate in vivo, with no direct effect of amphiregulin on tumor cell proliferation in vitro (Figure 5 and Figure S5). In contrast, we found a significant increase in necrosis in tumors after silencing of fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin (Figure 6). Notably, amphiregulin significantly protected the breast cancer cells from cell death induced by detachment from their normal extracellular matrix (anoikis, Figure 6). Together, these results suggest that fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin has potent effects on tumor progression, with autocrine effects leading to activation of fibroblasts and paracrine effects protecting cancer cells from cell death.Strong tumor suppressive responses are achieved by simultaneously targeting different mediators of tumor-fibroblast interactions on both cell typesCo-culturing also lead to changes in gene expression in the breast cancer cells, which upregulated a shared receptor for CCL2 and CCL7, the chemokine receptor CCR1 upon co-culturing with tumor-supportive fibroblasts (Figure 7). We therefore tested whether CCR1 expression by cancer cells was critical for some of the tumor supportive functions of fibroblasts by stably expressing shRNAs targeting CCR1 in Cal51 breast cancer cell line (knockdown efficiency was quantified by both qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, Figure S6). Silencing of CCR1 had no effect on tumor growth when cancer cells were injected alone. However, in the context of co-injection with fibroblasts, silencing of cancer cell CCR1 resulted in a 3-fold reduction in tumor size, almost eliminating the effect of the fibroblasts (Figure 7 and Figure S6). We further observed a 40% reduction in the proliferative index of cancer cells and a 2-fold reduction in recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes to the tumor, but only minor effects on the number of blood vessels and mesenchymal cells (Figure 7 and Figure S6). Thus, expression of CCR1 by cancer cells plays a critical role in enabling fibroblasts to exert tumor supportive function, through increased tumor cell proliferation and potentially indirectly through recruitment of leukocytes.Combined inhibition of chemokine and amphiregulin signaling is more effective at blocking the effects of tumor supportive fibroblasts.(A) Paracrine upregulation of the expression of ligand-receptor pairs upon co-culture of tumor supportive fibroblasts with basal breast cancer cells. The fold-change in ligand expression in tumor-supportive fibroblasts (x-axis) is plotted along with the fold-change in receptor expression in breast cancer cells (y-axis).

(E) Quantification of microenvironment effects as described in the legend to Figure 2. Five different fields of three different tumors per group were scored. Error bars represent SEM.

Asterisk indicates a significant difference in the CCR1 and AREG silenced group compared to the control where p\u200a=\u200a0.02.We next asked whether blocking two interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells was more effective than blocking either one alone. We therefore asked whether simultaneously silencing fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin and cancer cell expressed CCR1 was more efficacious than blocking either alone. We found that tumor growth was significantly more reduced when both pathways were targeted (Figure 7).Cancer cell induction of the fibroblast-secreted proteins requires parallel activationA number of studies have implicated specific cancer-cell secreted factors in the activation of neighboring fibroblasts, including TGF-\u03b2  and IL-1\u03b2 . We wanted to determine whether the repertoire of tumor-promoting fibroblast secreted factors could be induced by single specific inducers, or whether multiple pathways were acting in parallel. To test this, we used quantitative RT-PCR to measure gene expression changes in tumor-promoting fibroblasts of the five factors (CCL-2, -7, -8, AREG, and STC1) that we had determined all had functional relevance, along with two others factors (NRG1; MIM: 142445 and WISP1) that also were induced in the system. Surprisingly, TGF-\u03b2, did not induce expression of any of the seven factors (Table 2), despite its ability to induce activation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which resembles many aspects of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. AREG also did not induce expression of any of the seven factors, despite its key role in stimulating mammary fibroblasts during normal mammary development. IL-1\u03b2, a potent activator of NF-\u03baB signaling, produced an upregulation in chemokines CCL-2, -7, -8 similar to that seen by co-culture with breast cancer cells (Table 2). However, IL-1\u03b2 did not induce expression of WISP1, STC1, AREG, or NRG1. Interestingly, a combination of IL-1\u03b2 and AREG lead to significant upregulation of WISP1 in addition to stimulation of CCL-2, -7, -8. In contrast, none of the fibroblast factors were induced when TGF-\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b2 were combined (Table 2). Based on these results, it seems likely that the ability of breast cancer cells to induce the full spectrum of pro-tumorigenic fibroblast-secreted proteins involves a multitude of interacting factors, including some not previously identified. We also found that co-culture of tumor-promoting fibroblasts with a normal, non-malignant breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, was able to induce fibroblast expression of two out of the seven factors induced by breast cancer cells, namely AREG and WISP2 (Table 2). For these two factors, it would appear that breast epithelial cells per se, regardless of tumorigenic properties, elicit the same response in fibroblasts. This result is consistent with the key role that stromal AREG plays in normal mammary development.Induction in fibroblasts of chemokines and growth factors after treatment with single or combination of factors.Treatment\tFold induction\t \t\tCCL2\tCCL7\tCCL8\tWISP1\tSTC1\tAREG\tNRG1\t \tAREG\t1.0\t1.3\t0.7\t1.6\t0.9\t1.0\t1.1\t \tIL1\u03b2\t6.3*\t6.3*\t60.4*\t1.0\t1.7\t1.1\t1.3\t \tTGF\u03b2\t0.7\t1.9\t1.9\t1.4\t0.3\t0.6\t1.9\t \tIL1\u03b2+AREG\t10.1*\t7.8*\t55.3*\t4.0*\t2.0\t1.4\t1.4\t \tIL1\u03b2+TGF\u03b2\t1.3\t2.5\t0.9\t1.9\t0.4\t0.6\t2.0\t \tTGF\u03b2+AREG\t0.4\t1.6\tND\t1.9\t0.2\t0.7\t1.9\t \tAREG+IL1\u03b2+TGF\u03b2\t1.0\t2.0\t0.3\t1.3\t0.4\t0.9\t2.1*\t \tMCF10A co-culture\t1\t1.1\t1.1\t2.1*\t0.9\t6.1*\t0.9\t \tCal51 co-culture\t5.7*\t4.8*\t63.7*\t2.2*\t7.0*\t9.7*\t2.3*\t \tMDAMB231 co-culture\t6.2*\t4.0*\t114.8*\t3.6*\t11.8*\t23.5*\t4.0*\t \tInduction of chemokines (CCL2, CCL7 and CCL8) and growth factors (AREG, NRG1,WISP1 and STC1) in HFFF2 fibroblasts co-cultured with breast cancer cells or normal breast epithelial cells (co-culture Cal51; co-culture MDAMB231; MCF10A co-culture) or upon treatment with individual factors IL1\u03b2 (10 ng/ml), AREG (100 ng/ml) or TGF\u03b2 (10 ng/ml) or a combination was measured by qRT-PCR. Fold induction was calculated as the change in gene expression compared to untreated HFFF2 control cells. GAPDH was used as the normalization control for all experiments. Data shown is average of three experiments. Asterisk indicated that the fold induction is significant; p<0.05.DiscussionNumerous studies have used the co-injection assay to identify the factors produced by fibroblasts that are responsible for promoting tumorigenicity. These studies have identified single factors that when inhibited strongly suppress the ability of activated fibroblasts to promote tumorigenicity, and they include scatter factor, SDF-1, MMP14, NF-\u03baB, osteopontin, TGF-\u03b2, and CCL2 . However, these studies did not address whether the single factors were unique in their capacity of promoting fibroblast-supported tumorigenicity, nor did they compare different factors. Here, we used comparative genomics to identify 42 candidate mediators of fibroblast-promoted tumorigenicity and we tested the functional impact of a set of five of these factors. Surprisingly, we found that four of the five tested factors promoted tumorigenicity, three of them strongly (CCL7, CCL2, and AREG) and one of them weakly (CCL8) (Table 3). Although the fifth factor STC1 significantly affected tumorigenicity by the area under the tumor growth curve test (Table 3), it failed to show significant effects using t-tests at any single time points (data not shown). Since we only tested five of the 42 fibroblast-secreted-factors that were induced by breast cancer cells, it seems highly likely that an even greater number of fibroblast-secreted factors play a role in promoting tumorigenicity. Thus, our study indicates that even in a single system there are a large number of secreted factors involved in the ability of fibroblasts to promote carcinomas, rather than a single important mediator.Comparison of the effects on tumorigenicity and the microenvironment of inhibiting different fibroblast-secreted factors.Cal51+shHFFF2\tControl\tshAREG\tshCCL2\tshCCL8\tshCCL7\tshSTC1\t \tArea under curve\t \tMean\t1\t0.37\t0.27\t0.58\t0.26\t0.60\t \tSEM\t0.01\t0.03\t0.02\t0.02\t0.03\t0.03\t \tpval\t\t<0.01\t<0.01\t<0.01\t<0.01\t0.01\t \tEndpoint tumor volume\t \tMean\t1\t0.41\t0.43\t0.71\t0.34\t0.89\t \tSEM\t0.01\t0.02\t0.03\t0.03\t0.03\t0.04\t \tp value\t\t<0.01\t<0.01\t0.04\t<0.01\t0.46\t \tTumor microenvironment\t \tProliferation\t1\t0.91\t0.95\t0.93\t0.58\tNA\t \tp value\t\t0.06\t0.35\t0.43\t<0.01\t\t \tImmune cells\t1\t0.81\t0.33\t0.52\t1.11\tNA\t \tp value\t\t0.14\t<0.01\t<0.01\t0.34\t\t \tBlood vessels\t1\t0.88\t0.44\t1\t0.85\tNA\t \tp value\t\t0.24\t<0.01\t0.98\t0.11\t\t \tMesenchymal cells\t1\t0.17\t0.77\t0.63\t0.78\tNA\t \tp value\t\t<0.01\t0.08\t0.051\t0.11\t\t \tSummary of results obtained from tumorigenicity assays and immunohistochemical characterization of the tumor microenvironment in AREG, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8 and STC1 silenced tumors compared to non-target control. Three major parameters, namely total area under the curve (AUC), endpoint tumor volume (week 6 post injection) and immunohistochemistry of tumor microenvironment were used to quantify differences between the control and experimental groups.Intriguingly, our results also indicate widely diverse mechanisms for fibroblast-secreted factors in the promotion of tumorigenicity. The strong effects of fibroblast CCL7 appeared to be caused by a significant effect on cancer cell proliferation (Table 3), which was unique among the factors tested. We also found that reducing cancer cell expression of the CCL7 receptor, CCR1, also reduced fibroblast-induced proliferation. In contrast, the strong tumor promoting effects of fibroblast CCL2 was associated with different effects on the tumor microenvironment, as we found significant decreases in both angiogenesis and recruitment of innate immune cell upon silencing of CCL2. CCL8 had weaker effects on tumor growth than the other tested chemokines, which likely reflects it inability to affect either tumor proliferation or vascularity (Table 3). Fibroblast AREG also had very strong effects on tumor growth, and influenced both the total number of activated fibroblasts in the tumors and the survival of the cancer cells, a combination not observed with any other tested factor. Interestingly, secretion of amphiregulin by fibroblasts appeared to potentially act as a chemoattractant to recruit new fibroblasts and induce their proliferation and activation, resulting in a tumor microenvironment that is enriched in activated fibroblasts. Thus, in a single system of carcinoma cells and tumor-supportive fibroblasts, several factors play key roles.Our study also sheds light on how cancer cells modify the stromal cells to enable them to promote tumorigenicity. We tested several cancer cell-secreted factors, previously reported to influence stromal cells, but none of them were able to induce the full panel of verified tumor-promoting fibroblast factors as well as the cancer cells themselves. Even in one simple system, it appears that cancer cells act on fibroblasts through multiple factors, resulting in the secretion of another complex set of factors that influence cancer cells and other components of the tumor microenvironment.One of the key findings of our study was that inhibiting multiple interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts is more efficacious than blocking individual pathways. This finding is not completely unexpected in light of the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and in fact previous reports have suggested this as a possibility. Nevertheless, this result highlight that the different interactions are non-redundant and act in parallel, but it also suggests that effective anti-stromal fibroblast therapeutic strategies can be achieved by taking a multi-targeted approach. Future research towards this end will need to employ models that closely resemble the type of tumors to be targeted in human patients. This presents many challenges, including the ability to selectively target endogenous fibroblasts in tumor tissues, along with the ability to monitor the in vivo response of tumor-associated fibroblasts. Despite these challenges, our study shows that there are several potential combinatorial targets for future fibroblast-targeted therapeutic approaches.Materials and MethodsData filesAll genomic data for this study, including expression analysis of both fibroblasts and breast cancer cells, have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (GSE41678). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?token=bnepxkssyoamgdu&acc=GSE41678 Cell lines, co-culture, flow cytometry and gene expression analysisBreast cancer cell lines and human fibroblast strains were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) or Sigma (St.Louis, MO) and grown under standard tissue culture conditions in growth medium recommended by the supplier. For dual-color co-culture experiments, breast cancer cells stably expressing Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed) and human fibroblasts stably expressing Zoanthus sp. green fluorescent protein (ZsGreen) were generated using pRetroX-IRES-DsRedExpress vector and pRetroX-IRES-ZsGreen1 vector (Clontech, CA) respectively via retroviral transduction (detailed description in Supplemental Experimental Procedures). None of the experiments utilized multiple retroviral transfections. For the co-culture experiments, we transfected the original fibroblasts with a fluorescent marker in order to facilitate cell separation before transcriptome analysis (the breast cancer cells were transfected with a different fluorescent marker). For the shRNA experiments, we transfected the original fibroblasts with validated shRNA constructs from the Broad library. Co-culture of fluorescently-tagged breast cancer cells and fibroblasts was initiated by plating 1.5 million fibroblasts into 10 cm dishes, and after 18 hours 1 million breast cancer cells were added and then incubated for six days. Monocultures were performed in parallel for the same duration. Following co-culture or mono-culture, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in FACS sorting buffer (PBS+1% FBS) for separation into DsRed+ and ZsGreen+ populations using an ARIA II flow cytometer and analyzed using FACS DiVA software (Becton Dickenson, CA). Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Netherlands) and hybridized to Gene 1.0 ST arrays (Affymetrix, CA). Data was extracted, background corrected, normalized, and converted from probe values to gene values using the AROMA R package (www.aroma-project.org).Tumorigenicity assaysAll studies utilizing human xenograft experiments were approved by and in accordance with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Five to six week old female nude mice (NCR nu/nu; Charles River Inc., Wilmington, MA) were irradiated at 400 cGy 24\u201336 hours prior to injections. One million breast cancer cells were trypsinized, resuspended with or without 1.5 million fibroblasts in 100 \u00b5l DMEM and injected subcutaneously into both flanks of irradiated, nude mice. Growth was followed over time by taking caliper measurements at indicated time points. Tumor volume was measured as 0.52\u00d7length\u00d7width2. Tumors were excised six-eight weeks post injections or when one of the measurements reached 2 cm.Immunostaining and quantificationImmunostaining procedure is described in detail in Supplementary Experimental Procedures. The primary antibodies used for immunostaining are as follows: \u03b1-SMA (1\u22362000; # 1A4; Sigma-Aldrich), CD31 (1\u2236100; ab28364; Abcam), antigen 7/4 (1\u2236400, CL8993AP, Cedarlane), Ki-67 (1\u22362000; MIB5; Dako), pEGFR (1\u2236100; 1138-1; Epitomics) and GFP (1\u22361000; ab290; Abcam). Immunostained slides were quantified by counting (for 7/4, Ki-67 and CD31), by percentage of stained area (for \u03b1 \u2013SMA and pEGFR) using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).Additional methods are found in the file Text S1.Supporting InformationReferencesTumors as organs: complex tissues that interface with the entire organismMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerStromal gene expression predicts clinical outcome in breast cancerGene expression profiling of the tumor microenvironment during breast cancer progressionMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerThe biology of VEGF and its receptorsHeterotypic signaling between epithelial tumor cells and fibroblasts in carcinoma formationReciprocal activation of prostate cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemnessInterleukin-1 alpha promotes tumor growth and cachexia in MCF-7 xenograft model of breast cancerThe fibroblastic coconspirator in cancer progressionThe role of the microenvironment in mammary gland development and cancerTransient tumor-fibroblast interactions increase tumor cell malignancy by a TGF-Beta mediated mechanism in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancerStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionEnhanced hepatocyte growth factor signaling by type II transforming growth factor-beta receptor knockout fibroblasts promotes mammary tumorigenesisFibroblast-derived MT1-MMP promotes tumor progression in vitro and in vivoSenescent stromal-derived osteopontin promotes preneoplastic cell growthCCL2 mediates cross-talk between cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts that regulates breast cancer stem cellsThe senescence-associated secretory phenotype: the dark side of tumor suppressionCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Are Activated in Incipient Neoplasia to Orchestrate Tumor-Promoting Inflammation in an NF-kappaB-Dependent MannerAutocrine TGF-beta and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) signaling drives the evolution of tumor-promoting mammary stromal myofibroblastsFibroblasts in cancerGrowth and angiogenesis of human breast cancer in a nude mouse tumour model is reduced by NK4, a HGF/SF antagonistIntrinsic genetic characteristics determine tumor-modifying capacity of fibroblasts: matrix metalloproteinase-3 5A/5A genotype enhances breast cancer cell invasionInvasive breast cancer induces laminin-332 upregulation and integrin beta4 neoexpression in myofibroblasts to confer an anoikis-resistant phenotype during tissue remodelingInhibition of focal adhesion kinase by PF-562,271 inhibits the growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancer concomitant with altering the tumor microenvironmentROCK and JAK1 signaling cooperate to control actomyosin contractility in tumor cells and stromaHeterogeneity of gene expression in stromal fibroblasts of human breast carcinomas and normal breastMouse CCL8, a CCR8 agonist, promotes atopic dermatitis by recruiting IL-5+ T(H)2 cellsOverexpression of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A in ovarian cancer cells promotes tumor growth in vivoEGFL6 promotes endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinaseMycobacterial Disease and Impaired IFN-gamma Immunity in Humans with Inherited ISG15 DeficiencyModulation of the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis by the third complement component (C3)\u2013implications for trafficking of CXCR4+ stem cellsThe myeloid 7/4-antigen defines recently generated inflammatory macrophages and is synonymous with Ly-6BAngiogenesis, assessed by platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule antibodies, as indicator of node metastases and survival in breast cancerIdentification of fibroblast heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironmentTumor-stromal crosstalk in invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma: a pivotal role of CCL7The ADAM17-amphiregulin-EGFR axis in mammary development and cancerStanniocalcin 1 and ovarian tumorigenesisStructure, function, and inhibition of chemokinesInduction of alpha-smooth muscle actin by transforming growth factor-beta 1 in quiescent human breast gland fibroblasts.

        "content": "Recently, emerging evidence has suggested that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could contribute to chemotherapy resistances in breast cancer treatment. The aim of this study is to compare the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy and pick up candidate genes that might associate with chemotherapy resistance and could be used as predictors of treatment response. CAFs were cultured from surgically resected primary breast cancers and identified with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Flow cytometry (FCM). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured as the breast cancer cell line. Cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT) were performed to compare the function of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, after chemotherapy. Totally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with Taxotere (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). According to our study, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited characteristic phenotype. After chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. Moreover, 35 differentially expressed genes (absolute fold change &gt;2) were identified between CAFs after chemotherapy and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 were picked up as the candidate markers, of which the differential expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed.

The aim of this study is to compare the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy and pick up candidate genes that might associate with chemotherapy resistance and could be used as predictors of treatment response. CAFs were cultured from surgically resected primary breast cancers and identified with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Flow cytometry (FCM). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured as the breast cancer cell line. Cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT) were performed to compare the function of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, after chemotherapy. Totally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with Taxotere (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). According to our study, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited characteristic phenotype. After chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. Moreover, 35 differentially expressed genes (absolute fold change >2) were identified between CAFs after chemotherapy and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 were picked up as the candidate markers, of which the differential expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed. The results indicate the changes of gene expression in CAFs induced by Taxotere treatment and propose the candidate markers that possibly associate with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer.IntroductionBreast cancer is considered as the most common cancer in women, accounting for 29% of estimated new cancer cases and 14% of estimated cancer-related deaths. Chemotherapy is one of the cornerstone treatments in patients with breast cancer, which overall improves breast cancer outcome by 5\u201310% in patients with node negative disease. However, its use is increasingly affected by chemotherapy resistance and lack of effective predictors. Recently, emerging evidences have suggested that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could contribute to chemotherapy resistances in breast cancer treatment. As the most frequent component of stroma cells in tumor microenvironment, CAFs have been assumed to play an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of breast cancer. Moreover, Farmer et al. reported that increased stromal gene expression predicts resistance to preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC), suggesting that stroma activation could be involved in chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, it was shown that CAFs mediated resistance to chemotherapy by releasing collagen I. Loeffler et al. have developed a vaccine that could target CAFs and allow reversing resistance to chemotherapy.Considering the interaction between CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, it would be reasonable that chemotherapy-induced damage could have an impact on CAFs and change the expression of some relevant factors, which could participate in chemotherapy resistance. In our study, we have cultured CAFs which were derived from surgically resected primary breast cancers and compared the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy. The goal will be to find candidate markers from tumor microenvironment that associate with breast cancer chemotherapy resistance and discuss the possibility that these markers could be used as predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and feasible for targeted therapy.Materials and Methods1. Ethics StatementThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Written informed consent for using the samples for research purposes was obtained from all patients prior to surgery.2. Cell Culture of CAFs and Breast Cancer Cell LineTissues for primary cultures of CAFs were collected from 10 breast cancer patients who underwent complete surgical resection of their tumors at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Only tissues in excess of those required for clinical diagnoses were harvested for this study. Harvested tissues were placed in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen Corporation) for immediate transportation on ice to the laboratory. Tissues were minced into small pieces, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and digested for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in prepared reagent containing collagenase type I and Hyaluronidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell suspension was filtrated with 100 mesh screen and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and then the pellet was resuspended in the fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cell counting was performed with the Beckman Coulter Cell and Particle Counter Z1. The population doubling was estimated based on the increase in cell number counted at each passage time. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as the breast cancer cell line, according to the normal procedure (Sigma-Aldrich).3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)Primary antibodies for immunostaining included multi-cytokeratin (CK), Vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), CD34, and TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) (Labvision). CAFs were seeded in chamber slides and fixed in cold acetone. After antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous peroxidase in 3% hydrogen peroxide, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature in a moist chamber for 60 min. Specific signals were visualized by incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 min, followed by incubation with 3,3/-diaminobenzidine (DAB) used as a chromogen to create brown staining. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 min, and the slides were coverslipped.4. Flow Cytometry (FCM)CAFs were collected and prepared as a single cell suspension by mechanical blowing with PBS at the concentration of 1\u00d7105/ml. The expression of CD34 and CD45 (MACS) was detected using FCM (FACSC alibar; BD).5. Cell Adhesion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber (Transwell; Corning). For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere (Sanofi). Afterwards, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, until confluent. Matrigel (BD) was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and then 100 \u00b5l matrigel was added to each well in new 24-well plates. Two groups of MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and transferred to 24-well plates coated with matrigel. After incubation for 1 h, MDA-MB-231 cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of MDA-MB-231 cells that adhered to the bottom of coated wells was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.6. Invasion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. Matrigel was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and 50 \u00b5l/cm2 matrigel was added to each filter. The filters were placed in 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were added to each upper chamber, and CAFs were added to the lower chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed with a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.7. Proliferation Assay (MTT)The harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were treated with 0 ng/ml, 4 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml Taxotere, respectively. Then the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. Assays were initiated by adding 100 \u00b5l MTT (2 mg/ml) to each well and incubating the cells for an additional 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterwards, the medium was removed and 1 ml dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. Finally, the supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates in triplicate, which were read at a wavelength of 550 nm with a Thermo Scientific Multiskan\u00ae Spectrum.8. mRNA Expression ProfilingTotally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). Total RNA was extracted from all cultured CAFs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Microarray studies were performed by Capital Medical University Microarray Centre, using Illumina humanHT-12 v4 expression BeadChip based on Illumina BeadStation500. The biotinylated cRNA preparation, hybridization, and scanning of microarrays were done according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Biological replicates have been used to reduce errors. Illumina Gene Expression Beaderchips have internal control features to monitor data quality. The GenomeStudio software (Ilumina) calculates and reports a detection p-value, which determines whether a transcript on the array is called detected. In our study, a detection p-value below the threshold of 0.01 indicated that a gene could be considered as expressed. Differentially expressed genes in CAFs before chemotherapy vs. after chemotherapy were also identified and analyzed with GenomeStudio. The output was filtered to include genes whose expression was altered at least two-fold. The dataset of the microarray analysis has been deposited in ArrayExpress, with the accession number E-MTAB-1614.9. Real-Time PCRReal-Time PCR was performed to confirm differential gene expression in cultured CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h), using BIO-RAD IQ5 Real-Time PCR System. cDNA was synthesized using 1 \u00b5g total RNA, oligo (dT), and Superscript\u2122 III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Synthesis was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All the primers were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) for thecandidate genes. Predicted PCR product sequences were verified by using BLAST for recognition of target and non-target sequences.10. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc). Student\u2019s t test was used to test for statistical significance. Data were presented as the mean\u00b1standard error. p<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.Results1. Characterization of Primary-cultured CAFsBy using a study protocol approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board, CAFs were cultured from 10 surgically resected primary breast cancers which were histologically confirmed. The cultured cells were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. The morphological and immunohistochemical pictures of CAFs were represented in Figure 1A. Additionally, FCM showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs (Figure 1B).Characterization of primary-cultured CAFs.A showed the cultured cells which were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. B showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs with FCM.2. CAFs Promotes the Function of Breast Cancer Cells after ChemotherapyWe assumed that chemotherapy-induced damage interacted with tumor microenvironment and hence compared the function of MDA-MB-231 cells after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere) co-cultured with CAFs and that without CAFs. By using cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. The representative pictures of cell functional studies were shown in Figure 2.The function comparison of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, when treated with Taxotere.By using cell adhesion assay (A), invasion assay (B), and MTT assay (C), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with cells without co-culture.3. Comparison of Gene Expression Profiling in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyTotally 24314 expressed genes were detected in the microarray assay and 35 differentially expressed genes were identified (absolute fold change >2) between CAFs after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were summarized in Table S1 and Figure 3A with clustering analysis. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity (Figure 3B). The differentially expressed genes were also annotated in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion (hsa04510), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton (hsa04810), and MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010).Hierarchical clustering of gene analysis expression and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere).A showed the Heatmap plot of scaled gene-expression levels. The first 6 columns marked with \u201c1\u201d on top have represented the samples untreated with Taxotere, while the following 6 columns marked with \u201c2\u201d have represented the samples treated with Taxotere. Rows are genes with mean fold change between CAFs before and after chemotherapy. B and C revealed that these genes including up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity through GO analysis.4. Differential Expression of Candidate Genes in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyWe have picked up 6 genes from 35 differential genes and confirmed the different gene expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) via Real-Time PCR, using triplicate samples. The candidate genes included up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05). The pictures were represented in Figure 4.Differential expression of candidate genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy.The candidate genes were picked up from 35 differential genes, including up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. The differential expression of 6 genes in three pairs of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) was confirmed by Real-Time PCR. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05).DiscussionAs is known, cancer is a systemic disease encompassing multiple components of both tumor cells themselves and tumor microenvironment. The notion is now widely accepted that the development and progression of cancer highly depends on the interactions between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Recently, many investigations have pointed to stromal cells as the major regulator in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast cancers. However, the origin of CAFs has been a debate. Based on different theories, CAFs might arise from activated resident fibroblasts, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, cancer cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or other undetermined mechanisms. Correspondingly, CAFs were reported to exhibit different expression of multiple biomarkers such \u03b1-SMA, FSP-1, FAP, platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b1), platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b2), vimentin, CAV-1, PTEN, p21, or TP53 mutation. According to our study, CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) and negative expression of CK, CD34, as well as CD45, suggesting that these primary-cultured CAFs were more likely to arise from activated resident fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cells, endothelial cells or bone marrow. We are aware that the observation based on morphological characteristics is just weak evidence for explaining the origin hypothesis, which needs further and more fundamental studies. Moreover, our data showed that CAFs could promote the adhesion, invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells, which was consistent with peer researches.Breast cancer is known as the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been considered as an effective way which could improve the outcomes especially in patients with advanced and inflammatory diseases. However, the resistance of tumor cells to a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs and lack of useful predictive markers of response to NAC continue to be problems. Though the precise nature and molecular mechanism of chemotherapy resistance is still unclear, many current studies have focused on identifying novel predictors of chemotherapy efficiency. CAFs merit attention, in consideration of frequent association with chemotherapy resistance. Sonnenberg et al. reported highly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in CAFs from lung and breast, which could explain some levels of resistance in stroma-positive tumors where stroma would not be sensitive to chemotherapy. Furthermore, an oral DNA vaccine targeting fibroblasts activation protein (FAP) was developed to suppress primary tumor cell growth and metastasis of multidrug-resistant murine breast carcinoma and allowed reversing resistance to chemotherapy, by increasing intratumoral drug uptake. Based on our data, the comparison of gene expression profiling between CAFs before and after chemotherapy indicated the solid gene changes and provided candidate markers that might participate in chemotherapy resistance. Considering the correlation of breast cancer treatment and tumor microenvironment (especially CAFs), we suppose that the genes about membrane protein and secreted factors will be likely to associate with chemotherapy resistance. Then we have looked through the relevant literatures, to evaluate the research status and prospect of these genes, and eventually chosen CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 as candidate genes. The differential expression of these genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed by RT-RCR (p<0.05), suggesting potential predictors of response to treatment.CXCL2 is one member of a family of structurally related chemokines, which are also called ELR-positive subgroup of CXC-chemokines. It was reported that CXCL2 could enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro and differential expression of CXCL2 in colon cancer had impact on metastatic disease and survival. In addition, CXCL2 was found to show significantly different expression in 5-FU responder and nonresponder breast cancer cell lines, suggesting its relationship with chemotherapy response. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 has been focused on, in view of the association between its five polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Moreover, the study carried out by Li et al. established the relationship between TP and MMPs in cancer cell invasion. Recently, the up-regulation expression of MMP1 was observed during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude mice, indicating potential targets involved in the control of metastasis. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which was indicated to correlate with the growth and progression of tumors. Some interesting observations were made with regard to the prognostic role of baseline plasma IL8 protein levels in breast cancer patients treated with weekly docetaxel. Besides, Snoussi et al. pointed out that the polymorphisms in IL-8 and its receptor CXCR2 are associated with increased breast cancer risk and disease progress, implying that IL-8 and CXCR2 might contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis and aggressiveness. Lee et al. found that increased expression of IL-8 in the tumor microenvironment enhanced colon cancer growth and metastasis, which is very inspiring for our research. All the above markers including CXCL2, MMP1 and IL-8 were up-regulated based on our study, while FGF1, RARRES1 and CXCR7 as follows were down-regulated.As is known, breast cancer cells overexpress fibroblast growth factor receptors. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) was reported to be especially suitable as chemotherapeutic drug carrier in light of its biological activity. Additionally, FGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR could efficiently decrease breast cancer cell viability, suggesting the possibility for targeted therapy. According to these data, it could be assumed that decreased expression of FGF1 might be involved in the chemotherapy resistance. Retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1) is a retinoid regulated gene, which is accounted as a tumor suppress gene and lost in many cancer cells. It has been demonstrated that the down-regulation of RARRES1 is related to tumor growth of colorectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The investigation on the role of RARRES1 in the chemotherapy resistance is still rare, therefore its decreased expression in CAFs after chemotherapy caused our attention. CXCR7, as well as CXCR4, have been known as the receptors of chemokine CXCL12. Liberman et al. considered that CXCR7 would elicit anti-tumorigenic functions, and may act as a regulator of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling in neuroblastoma. Recently Hernandez et al. found that CXCR7 impaired invasion of breast cancer, in contrast to CXCR4. We propose that CXCR7 would contribute to the chemotherapy resistance in the condition of treatment-induced damage to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, in the abovementioned candidate genes, CXCL2, MMP1 and IL8 are recognized as secretory-type genes, which possibly could be tested in serum in the form of genes or proteins. Its relationship with prognosis will be studied.Overall, in this study we have primarily cultured CAFs, compared its gene expression profiling before and after chemotherapy, and picked up 6 candidate genes which are possibly associated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. We hope that our study might supply the potential predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and possible targets for treatment, which could provide the patient with optimal therapeutic management and better prognosis. For further study, the molecular mechanism of these candidate markers will continue to be researched to elucidate their relationship with chemotherapy resistance.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer statistics, 2012Effects of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy for early breast cancer on recurrence and 15-year survival: an overview of the randomised trialsImplication of tumor microenvironment in the resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patientsStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionRoots and stems: stem cells in cancerA stroma-related gene signature predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancerRole of extracellular matrix assembly in interstitial transport in solid tumorsTargeting tumor-associated fibroblasts improves cancer chemotherapy by increasing intratumoral drug uptakeTumor microenvironment and breast cancer progression: A complex scenarioFibroblasts in cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor growth-bystanders turning into key playersA fibroblast-associated antigen: characterization in fibroblasts and immunoreactivity in smooth muscle differentiated stromal cellsEpithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer can provide a nonmalignant stromaBone marrow contribution to tumor-associated myofibroblasts and fibroblastsAdipose tissue-derived stem cells differentiate into carcinoma-associated fibroblast-like cells under the influence of tumor-derived factorsp53 Attenuates cancer cell migration and invasion through repression of SDF-1/CXCL12 expression in stromal fibroblastsExpression of p21waf1/Cip1 in stromal fibroblasts of primary breast tumorsPten in stromal fibroblasts suppresses mammary epithelial tumoursCaveolin-1 and mitochondrial SOD2 (MnSOD) function as tumor suppressors in the stromal microenvironment: a new genetically tractable model for human cancer associated fibroblastsRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisImpact, mechanisms, and novel chemotherapy strategies for overcoming resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes in metastatic breast cancerAdvances in neoadjuvant (primary) systemic therapy with cytotoxic agentsResearch issues affecting preoperative systemic therapy for operable breast cancer17p12 deletion in breast cancer predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapyBRCA1 protein levels and PIK3CA mutations as predictive biomarkers for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: An exploratory analysisHighly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from lung and breastThe role of CXC chemokines and their receptors in cancerDifferential expression of the chemokines GRO-2, GRO-3, and interleukin-8 in colon cancer and their impact on metastatic disease and survivalCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCurrent evidence on the relationship between five polymorphisms in the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) gene and lung cancer risk: A meta-analysisIncreased Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases Mediates Thromboxane A2-Induced Invasion in Lung Cancer CellsProtein expression changes during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude miceIncreased expression of MMP-9 and IL-8 are correlated with poor prognosis of Bladder CancerInterleukin-8 secretion by ovarian cancer cells increases anchorage-independent growth, proliferation, angiogenic potential, adhesion and invasionExpression of Angiogenic Markers in the Peripheral Blood of Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer Treated with Weekly DocetaxelCombined effects of IL-8 and CXCR2 gene polymorphisms on breast cancer susceptibility and aggressivenessInterleukin-8 and its receptor CXCR2 in the tumour microenvironment promote colon cancer growth, progression and metastasisFGF-1 as a possible carrier for targeted drug deliveryFGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR efficiently decrease cell viability upon NIR irradiationTazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) expression in prostate carcinomas and its relationship to tumorigenicityRole of the RARRES1 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinomaRARRES1 expression is significantly related to tumour differentiation and staging in colorectal adenocarcinomaInvolvement of the CXCR7/CXCR4/CXCL12 Axis in the Malignant Progression of Human NeuroblastomaOpposing roles of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in breast cancer metastasis"

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

        "content": "The communication between carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells facilitate tumor metastasis. In this study, we further underlying the epigenetic mechanisms of CAFs feed the cancer cells and the molecular mediators involved in these processes. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with CAFs culture conditioned medium, respectively. Cytokine antibody array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to identify the key chemokines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay were performed to explore the transactivation of target LncRNA by CAFs. A series of in vitro assays was performed with RNAi-mediated knockdown to elucidate the function of LncRNA. An orthotopic mouse model of MDA-MB-231 was conducted to confirm the mechanism in vivo.

Specifically, high rates of metastasis to the lymph nodes, lungs, bone and brain, not the primary tumor, are the leading cause of breast cancer death. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis may lead to more effective strategies for the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer.Growing evidence indicates that malignant breast tissue requires complex local and systemic stromal interactions to provide a tumor-promoting environment during breast carcinoma development and progression. Specifically, tumor stromal cells cross-communicate and develop an aggressive phenotype of cancer cells, which are recognized as an important modulator and even a driver of tumorigenicity. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component of the tumor microenvironment, have been proven to be a major contributor of various processes, such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and drug resistance. These effects are mediated by paracrine stimulation from a variety of growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukins (IL). Our previous study indicated that CAFs stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impaired taxol efficacy in breast cancer by elevating NF-\u03baB/miR-21 signaling. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which CAFs feed the cancer cells and allow them to acquire an aggressive phenotype and the molecular mediators involved in these processes have not been extensively studied.In addition to the several well-documented gene mutations that have been associated with the development of breast cancer, considerable attention is being focused on the participation of epigenetic events, including the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. Highly up-regulated in breast cancer, the lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) mediates H3K27 tri-methylation and the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is considered a key molecule and potential biomarker for breast cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR is reportedly involved in drug resistance and stemness maintenance in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, growing evidence indicates that HOTAIR promotes metastasis breast, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma. Given its critical role during tumor progression, HOTAIR is a novel target for breast cancer therapy.The activation of CDK5 signaling has been implicated in the control of cell motility and metastatic potential, which are significantly correlated with several markers of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that the aberrant activation of CDK5 signaling is associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which was responsible for high-dose taxol-induced invasion and EMT. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of CDK5 remains elusive. Moreover, CDK5 was proven to be essential for TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in breast cancer progression. Strikingly, aberrant CDK5 promoter DNA hypomethylation was identified in the mantle cell lymphoma genome compared with normal naive B cells. These findings indicate an interaction between CDK5 signaling and tumor stromal cells, which may underlie the novel epigenetic mechanism of tumor environment-induced metastasis and hold therapeutic potential in breast cancer.Based on these previous studies, we further demonstrated that CAFs promoted the metastasis of breast cancer cells via paracrine TGF-\u03b21, which is a crucial mediator of the interaction between stromal and cancer cells. Importantly, CAFs transactivated HOTAIR to promote EMT. Strikingly, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4. Additionally, CAFs mediated HOTAIR expression and EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling, and H3K27 trimethylation was highly enriched at the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. Overall, we describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the CAF-induced aggressive behavior of cancer cells, which support the targeting of the TGF-\u03b21/ HOTAIR axis as a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.MethodsCell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The CAFs were isolated and cultured as described previously. CAFs were acquired from four invasive breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), and the use of specimens was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH. CAFs were obtained from tissues that had been cut into small pieces and digested with collagenase type I (1\u2009mg/mL; Sigma) and hyaluronidase (125\u00a0units/mL; Sigma) for 6\u2009h in DMEM without FBS at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After filtering the undigested tissues, the stromal fraction was centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) or RMPI Medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Cytokine antibody arrayThe profiles of cytokines secreted by CAFs were detected in the culture supernatants using a Human Cytokine Array (RayBiotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cytokines with distinct differences in expression were screened out.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The culture medium was removed and used to assess the level of extracellular TGF-\u03b21 with a TGF-\u03b21 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, abcam) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results are expressed in ng/mL.Western blottingThe total protein was extracted with cold radio-immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The cell lysates were separated using 8-10% SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Antibodies against human CDK5, CDK5RAP1, H3K27me3, EZH2 (1:1000 dilutions, Cell Signaling Technology), Egr-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin (1:1000 dilutions, Abcam), and \u03b2-actin (1:4000 dilutions, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. Rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. The antibody-labeled protein bands on membranes were detected with a G-BOX iChemi XT instrument (Syngene).ImmunofluorescenceAfter various treatments, cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100 for 10\u2009min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1\u2009h. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted with antibodies against \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and vimentin (1:100 dilutions, Abcam). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Technologies) secondary antibodies. To detect the formation of stress fibers, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscopes. Cells from three independent experiments in which at least 300 cells were counted were quantified.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the standard protocol. HOTAIR cDNA was obtained from total RNA using the Fast Quant RT Kit (TIANGEN). Real-time PCR was performed using Super Real Pre Mix Plus SYBR Green (TIANGEN) on an ABI-7500 Real-time PCR machine (Life Technologies).The following thermocycling protocol was employed: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 40\u00a0cycles. GAPDH was used as the internal control. Data are presented as fold changes (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct) and were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software V 2.02 (MJ Research).Wound-healing assayApproximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 cells or 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MCF-7 cells were plated in six-well plates after different treatments. A linear scratch/wound was made on the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs of live cells were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification, and the distance migrated was observed after 48\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h.Matrigel invasion assayThe Matrigel invasion assay was performed in 24-well Transwell culture plates. Briefly, 40\u2009\u03bcL of Matrigel (1\u2009mg/mL, BD) was applied to 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane filters. Approximately 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MDA-MB-231 cells or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MCF-7 cells were resuspended and then seeded in 24-well Transwell plates containing FBS-free medium in the upper chamber and complete growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the lower chamber for 24\u00a0h or 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Non-invading cells were removed from the upper surfaces of the invasion membranes, and the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin. The average number of cells per field was determined by counting the cells in six random fields per well. Cells were counted in four separate fields in three independent experiments.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)The expression of HOTAIR in paraffin-embedded sections and cells of different conditions seeded on the sterile coverslips for 48\u00a0h was examined in situ hybridization. First, we deparaffinized and rehydrated the samples. Before digesting samples with proteinase K, we used 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the paraffin-embedded sections and DEPC water to fix the cell samples. We then hybridized samples with a 5\u2019Cy3-labeled modified HOTAIR probe (6\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After completing the hybridization, the samples were successively washed twice with solution buffer (2\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7, chloride sodium citrate buffer) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min each. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using an FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)The EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) was used to perform the ChIP assays. Briefly, 1% formaldehyde was used to fix cells, and 0.125\u00a0M glycine was then used to neutralize the formaldehyde. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer with SDS and protease inhibitors. Soluble chromatins of 200-1000\u00a0bp were collected after sonication and pre-cleared in 1:10 dilution buffer, followed by incubation with IgG, H3K27me3 and EZH2 anti-bodies on a rotating platform overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing the immunocomplexes captured by protein G-Sepharose beads, the bound DNA fragments were eluted for real-time qPCR analysis using ChIP primer.Luciferase reporter assayThe upstream 2.5\u2009kb promoter regions of HOTAIR were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (GV238 vector), and the mutations of predicted SMADs binding sites were also cloned into the same luciferase reporter vector. Cells were co-transfected with SMAD plasmid GV219 vector and HOTAIR plasmid (wild type or mutant) for 24\u00a0h, and the promoter activities were examined with a luciferase assay.Orthotopic nude mouse models and treatmentBALB/c nude mice aged 4-6\u00a0weeks were purchased from the Animal Center at the Cancer Institute at Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Lenti-HOTAIR or Lenti NC and CAFs were injected into the mammary fat pads of each nude mouse at a ratio of 1:3. The mice were imaged for luciferase activity with an IVIS imaging system once per week.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry analysisThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to an immunohistochemistry analysis. After blocking with 3% H2O2 and non-immune rabbit serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by a streptavidin-biotinylated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The chromogenic substrate was developed with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine, andhematoxylin was used for counter staining. The results were visualized using a light microscope.Statistical analysesSPSS 16.0 (IBM, USA) was used for all calculations. All values are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made using Student\u2019s t-test, and differences among groups were assessed with a two-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significance was set to P\u2009<\u20090.05.*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01.ResultsParacrine TGF-\u03b21 was essential for CAFs to promote the metastasis of breast cancer cellsTGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated cells. a Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of CAFs. b The top ten cytokine secreted by CAFs. Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of MCF-7 (c), MDA-MB-231(e) and by treatment of CAF-CM. Relative signal intensity of top ten increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (d), MDA-MB-231(f), compared to the control cellsDuring breast cancer progression, CAFs may supply appropriate signals that may promote the development of aggressive phenotypes in carcinoma cells and establish a complex scenario, which culminates in metastasis. To identify the cytokines secreted by CAFs that enhance tumorigenic ability, the cytokine profiles of cell supernatants from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and treatment with conditioned media of CAFs (CAF-CM) were analyzed using a RayBiotech Human Cytokine Antibody Array. The top four cytokines secreted in the supernatant of CAFs were TGF-\u03b21, IGFBP-4, IGF-1 and PDGF-AA (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in both CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (Fig. 1c, d) as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to control cells (Fig.1e, f).To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, the distribution of TGF-\u00df1 in clinic samples was performed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). It\u2019s well documented that CAFs strongly expressed \u03b1-SMA, whereas were negative for the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin-7 and TGF-\u00df1 showed that the red fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 colocalized with green fluorescence of \u03b1-SMA, but not with cytokeratin-7 in both invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. More important, much more and stronger fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 was detected in invasive breast carcinoma, compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively, these results indicated that TGF-\u00df1may be secreted by CAFs.Paracrine TGF-\u03b21 was enssential for CAFs induced EMT. a The amount of TGF-\u03b21 released into the cell culture supernatant of cells treated with CAF-CM was determined by ELISA. b The wound-healing assay of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor SB431542 (SB) or pirfenidone (PFD), respectively. c SB or PFD treatment impaired the CAF-mediated increase in invading cancer cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. d Western blotting analysis for E-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b2-catenin of cells treated as in (b). e Immunofluorescence staining showed that treatment with SB or PFD increased E-cadherin levels, decreased vimentin and nuclear \u03b2-catenin distribution in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. CAFs promoted F-actin polymerization and stability in cancer cells, whereas treatment with SB or PFD impaired the formation of stress fibers. Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcmDue to the changes of quantity and quality in CAFs from different patients, we extracted CAFs from four invasive breast carcinomas patients to reduce the original difference in this study (Additional file 1: Figure S2). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with conditioned media of CAF1#, CAF2#, CAF3# and CAF4#, respectively. ELISA further confirmed all of the four CAFs populations induced significant increased TGF-\u03b21 level in the supernatants from CAF-CM-treated cells (mean value: 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 6.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.243\u00a0ng/ml in MCF-7 cells; 0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 4.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0ng/ml in MDA-MB-231 cells) (Fig.\u00a02a, Additional file 1: Figure S3). We then further evaluated the role of TGF-\u03b21 in CAFs induced EMT of cancer cells. We found that TGF-\u03b21 treatment achieved similar enhanced the migratory activity of cancer cell, compared with CAF-CM treated cells (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the small-molecule inhibitors of TGF-\u03b21, SB451332 (SB) or Pirfenidone (PFD) treatment abrogated the CAF-CM induced promotion of cell migration. Moreover, all of the four CAFs populations were competent in enhancing the cell invasive ability, while the number of invading cells was deceased 2- to 3.5-fold in SB or PFD treated cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Figure S4). Moreover, SB and PDF treatment markedly rescued the induction of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin expression as well as the repression of E-cadherin in CAF-CM-treated cells (Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescent images showed that SB or PFD treatment decreased the nuclear signals of \u00df-catenin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the nuclear translocation to the cytoplasm was promoted (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the remodeling and polarization of F-actin was observed after CAF stimulation, whereas the formation of a stress fiber pattern was abolished after SB or PFD treatment. These results identified TGF-\u03b21 as a crucial mediator of the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer cells and TGF-\u03b21 was necessary for CAFs to induce EMT of cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT by activating the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cellsCAFs enhanced the expression of the lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cells to induce EMT. a The expression of seveal metastasis associated LncRNAs treated with CAF-CM was measured by RC-PCR. HOTAIR levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells upon treatment with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, SB or PFD was measured by real-time RT-PCR (b) or FISH (c). Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. d Western blotting indicated that the EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression levels were significantly increased in CAF-CM-treated cells. e The expression levels of the indicated epithelial or mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were measured by western blotting. f The depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invaded cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. Quantitation of invasive MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. For each measurement, \u2265\u200910 fields of view with \u2265\u2009100 cells were analyzed; *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01The epigenetic regulation of lncRNA triggered invasion and metastasis in breast cancer. To study the epigenetic mechanism by which CAFs induce EMT in cancer cells, the expression of several lncRNAs were measured by RT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a). Specifically, CAF-CM resulted in the largest increases in HOTAIR expression, 3.5- and 8.7-fold increases inMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to the control cells. Similar to CAF-CM, recombinant TGF-\u03b21 also increased the levels of HOTAIR (Fig. 3b). However, the CAF-CM mediated activation of HOTAIR was attenuated after SB or PFD treatment. FISH images revealed that SB or PFD repressed the nuclear distribution of HOTAIR induced by CAF-CM (Fig. 3c), and Western blotting analysis indicated that the protein levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 were notably increased (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the induction of E-cadherin and repression of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin was observed in HOTAIR knock-down cells (Fig. 3e), and the depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invading cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 3f, Additional file 1: Figure S5). Based on these data, we concluded that CAFs promoted metastasis by activating HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which CAFs activate HOTAIR remain to be addressed.HOTAIR is a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4CAFs activated the transcription of HOTAIR by SMAD2/3/4. a Western blotting analysis of the effect of recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, SB or PFD treatment on the p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. b The HOTAIR expression upon treatment of siRNA against SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 was determined by real time PCR. c SMAD2/3/4 were enriched in the promoter of HOTAIR in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, as determined by a CHIP assay. d A bioinformatics assay showed the predicted binding sites of SMAD2/3/4 within the HOTAIR promoter region. e A mutational analysis of HOTAIR promoter activity. The wild-type and mutant promoter constructs were co-transfected with SMAD2, 3, or 4 plasmids into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assayTGF-\u03b2 is known to assemble a receptor complex that activates Smads thereby assembling multi-subunit complexes that regulate transcription. Western blotting analysis indicated that the levels of phosphorylated of Smad2 protein (p-SMAD2), p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4were significantly elevated in CAF-CM and TGF-\u03b21-treated cancer cells, suggesting that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a04a). However, the repression of p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 was detected in cells treated with SB or PFD. Moreover, RT-PCR showed a 50-60% reduction in HOTAIR expression in cells transfected with SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 siRNA (Fig. 4b). To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying CAF-induced HOTAIR activation, we used ChIP technology to identify the genomic locations bound by SMADs in cancer cells before and after co-culture with CAF-CM. The ChIP results indicated that CAFs stimulate the direct binding of SMAD2, 3, and 4 to the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4c), and a promoter analysis using JASPAR and PROMO indicated several candidate SMAD binding sites in the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4d). The relative profile score threshold set as 80% in JASPAR and the maximum matrix dissimilarity rate set as 15% in PROMO. Accordingly, the deletion of predicted binding sites (Mut-1 and Mut-2) within the HOTAIR promoter region decreased SMAD2/3/4 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the deletion of the remaining mutant binding sites did not result in significant differences compared with control group (Fig. 4e). Therefore, we concluded that SMADs directly bind the promoter site of HOTAIR located between nucleotides -386 and -398, -440 and -452 (the genome coordinates: chr12: 53975342-53975354, chr12: 53975396-53975408), and consequently induced the transactivation of HOTAIR.Based on these results, we elucidated that CAFs transactivated HOTAIR via the secretion TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4.CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signalingCAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling. a Western blotting indicated that CDK5 expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 expression levels were greatly decreased. b The histone methylation status of CDK5 signaling was determined with a CHIP assay, which indicated that H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, whereas the depletion of HOTAIR blocked this function of CAFs. The results are presented as the fold-change over the control. c ChIP analysis revealed that elevated EZH2 was recruited to the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. All experiments were repeated three times. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. negative controlWe previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. Consistent with our previous study, CDK5 protein expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the levels of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 were greatly decreased (Fig.\u00a05a). These findings suggest that the activation of CDK5 was essential for CAF-induced EMT. To investigate the epigenetic events that were involved in the activation of CDK5 in breast cancer, we first examined the histone methylation status using ChIP assays (Fig. 5b). Profiling histone methylation marks on the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter by qChIP showed that H3K27me3 is highly enriched at the promoter of both genes in CAF-CM treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells compared with the control cells. Whereas the depletion of HOTAIR rescued the effect of CAFs, the H3K27me3 levels at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter were remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the recruitment of EZH2 to the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was measured, which indicated that the level of PRC2 components at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was significantly decreased (Fig. 5c). Based on these data, we demonstrated that the activation of CDK5 was required for CAF-mediated EMT. Specifically, CAFs stimulated CDK5 expression by H3K27 trimethylation on the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling.Knock-down HOTAIR inhibited CAF-induced tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivoThe depletion of HOTAIR suppressed CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. a Representative pseudocolor bioluminescence images of tumor size were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors of MDA-MB-231-Luc cells were transfected with control shRNA or shHOTAIR. Each group included eight mice (n\u2009=\u20098). Primary tumor volumes (b) and representative bioluminescence images (BLI) (c) were evaluated. d Lung metastasis was detected by bioluminescent imaging on days 35 and 42. e Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained lung tissues. f The expression of HOTAIR was assessed by FISH. g Representative images of the immunohistochemical staining of CDK5, EZH2, \u00df-catenin, H3K27me3, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 in tissues. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcmTo study the epigenetic mechanism of CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, an MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established in nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging was monitored weekly and indicated that all of the four CAF populations remarkably promoted primary tumor growth, whereas shHOTAIR treatment markedly reduced tumor volume (Fig.\u00a06a-c, Additional file 1: Figure S6). Most importantly, CAFs resulted in dramatic lung metastasis with extensive tumor foci compared to control cells, as determined by quantitative bioluminescence images (Fig. 6d). However, this metastatic phenomenon was attenuated when HOTAIR was knocked down, and H&E staining further confirmed these results (Fig. 6e). Compared to the control group, CAFs enhanced the nuclear staining of HOTAIR, as revealed by FISH, which further confirmed our in vitro study (Fig. 6f). Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed the downregulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and reductions in p-SMAD2-, p-SMAD3-, EZH2- and H3K27me3- positive cells in the shHOTAIR group (Fig. 6g). Taken together, these findings indicate that shHOTAIR treatment efficiently blocked the crosstalk between CAFs and tumor cells, thereby impairing CAF-induced EMT. Collectively, these experiments supported the notion that the secretion TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD pathway in breast cancer cells, resulting in the up-regulation of HOTAIR transcription and histone modification of the CDK5 signaling pathway, thereby promoting breast cancer progression and metastasis.Aberrant HOTAIR correlated with a poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancerOverexpressed HOTAIR correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. a HOTAIR expression was analyzed by FISH. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. b Immunohistochemistry staining detected EZH2, CDK5, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 expression in 59 breast carcinoma samples (39 with lymph node metastasis, 19 in situ carcinoma)To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, we collected 59 breast carcinoma samples and examined markers of CAFs FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA by immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression levels of FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA were significantly up-regulated in invasive breast carcinoma (97.5%, 38 in 39), compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 33.3%, 7 of 20), suggesting that CAFs facilitated tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Compared to DCIS, HOTAIR expression and nuclear staining were higher in metastatic breast carcinoma, as revealed by FISH images, which indicated that the upregulation of HOTAIR strongly correlated with tumor metastasis (Fig.\u00a07a). Furthermore, the expression levels of EZH2 and CDK5 exhibited similar patterns, which further confirmed our in vitro and in vivo studies (Fig. 7b).DiscussionThe proposed model of the paracrine and epigenetic mechanism of CAFs induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. CAFs secreted high levels of TGF-\u03b21, resulting in the transactivation of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells, consequently enhanced metastasisBased on our results, we propose a model of the CAF-mediated upregulation of HOTAIR transcription in breast cancer cells that promotes invasion and metastasis via the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 (Fig.\u00a08). The hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b21 signaling clearly contributes to tumor metastasis and the metabolic reprogramming and activation of CAFs. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 has been linked to poor clinical outcome and is required for the CAF-mediated initiation of efficient metastasis. Consistent with these results, our data further indicate that the key pro-metastatic function of CAFs depends on TGF-\u03b21 secretion (Fig. 2). Specifically, blocking TGF-\u03b21 secretion with SB or PFDefficiently abrogated CAF-mediated metastasis. Our study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 is a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment.Non-coding RNAs have been added to the growing list of gene regulators that contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, mounting evidence has revealed that the up-regulation of HOTAIR contributed to drug resistance and tumor metastasis in various types of solid tumors. In this study, our experiment demonstrated that CAFs upregualted HOTAIR expression via TGF-\u03b21 secretion, supporting its importance in breast cancer progression (Fig. 3b-f). Most importantly, SMAD2/3/4 directly bound the promoter site of HOTAIR, as revealed by CHIP and luciferase reporter assay, suggesting that HOTAIR was a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4 (Fig. 4c and e). These findings suggested that the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs clearly led to the transactivation of HOTAIR expression. And the breast cancer microenvironment plays a key role in maintaining HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. Our studies provide a strong body of evidence to support that the modulation of epigenetic control and targeted alterations of HOTAIR represent novel therapeutic targets in breast cancer.Extensive reports have identified several microRNA induced by CAFs (e.g., miR-26b, miR-148a and miR-133b) that were invovled in tumor progression. Specifically, our previous study verified that CAFs impaired taxol efficacy by activating miR-21 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe that the CAF-mediated expression of long non-coding RNA led to enhanced cell migration and invasion.We previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of CDK5 activation has not been fully elucidated. In cancer, gene expression profiles revealed a loss of tumor suppressor gene expression due to aberrant histone modification. Specifically, Kumar et al. reported that H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter of CDK5 was a key mechanism underlying cocaine-induced plasticity in the striatum. In the present study, we proved that CAFs mediated the transcription of HOTAIR, leading to a strong increase in the H3K27-mediated trimethylation of the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoters, thereby activating CDK5 expression and EMT.Although our study focuses on the TGF-\u03b21, CAFs may also secrete a cocktail of additional pro-metastatic factors, such as IL-6 and IGF-II, to contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, additional crucial lncRNAs involved in the development of breast cancer remain to be investigated.ConclusionsCAFs may orchestrate multiple non-coding RNA and signaling pathways to control several biological processes in a paracrine manner during breast cancer progression. We reported here that secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs was a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal cells and cancer cells to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. Our study revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis, the TGF-\u00df1/HOTAIR axis controls the development and progression of breast cancer, which supports the pursuit of these molecules as targets of breast cancer treatment.Additional fileAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerCAFsCarcinoma associated fibroblastsDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumEMTEpithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionFBSFetal bovine serumHOTAIRHOX transcript antisense RNAPBSPhosphate-buffered salinePCRPolymerase chain reactionPFDPirfenidoneSBSB431542Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12943-018-0758-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Authors\u2019 contributionsMM,CSK and YR conceived and designed this study.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown. Methods: Four CAF cultures were isolated from chemotherapy-na\u00efve BC patients and characterized for ER\u03b136 expression and the NanoString gene expression panel using isolated RNA. Conditioned media from CAF cultures were used to assess the influence of CAFs on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells using a matrigel 3D culture assay. Results: We found that ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly induced the branching of TNBC cells in vitro (p < 0.001). They also produced a set of pro-tumorigenic cytokines compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs, among which hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the main inducer of TNBC cell invasive phenotype in vitro (p < 0.001). Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

However, recently, clinical and experimental evidence have revealed that tumor development is intimately related to the complex interactions that transpire within the tumor microenvironment. Neoplastic epithelial cells engage in reciprocal molecular dialogues with surrounding stromal cells, including inflammatory cells, vascular cells and fibroblasts, resulting in the production of stromal-derived tumor-aiding factors, such as growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, proteases, and vascular-stimulating factors. These molecular communications at the site of the primary tumor enable its growth and dissemination.Breast cancer represents one example of a carcinoma in which the collaborative efforts from malignant epithelial cells and stromal cells within the primary tumor coordinate carcinogenesis, and ultimately, metastasis to distant organs. Women have a 12% risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetimes, and a 5% risk of breast carcinoma-related death. Mortality results from frequent metastasis, which reduces long-term survival (+5 years) from approximately 90% to 5%. A xenograft model of breast cancer has shown that breast carcinoma cells depend on stromal cells to metastasize. This may be explained by the finding that the stroma plays a paramount role in supporting breast tumor growth and vascularization, both of which are prerequisite to metastasis. Because of the importance of the tumor/stromal interactions in promoting breast cancer metastasis, it is imperative to elucidate the molecular events that occur between cancer cells and adjacent stroma at the site of the primary tumor.Of particular interest are the stromal fibroblasts found within mammary carcinomas, which by volume constitute the major cellular component of the tumor microenvironment. Termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), these cells have been connected to several tumor-promoting events, including: angiogenesis, anti-tumor immunosuppression, genetic instability, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. Although the importance of these cells in tumor progression has been acknowledged, CAFs have not been clearly and universally defined, and are only roughly characterized by their enhanced production of tumor-promoting factors.Similar to the way in which a tumor is equated to a \u201cwound that never heals\u201d, CAFs have been compared to \u201cactivated fibroblasts\u201d or myofibroblasts, which are present in inflammatory environments, where they play a critical role in angiogenesis and the production of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Several studies suggest that myofibroblasts constitute the majority of CAFs, as determined by alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), a marker for differentiated myofibroblasts. In contrast, other data suggest that not all CAFs within the tumor microenvironment are myofibroblasts. For example, Holliday and colleagues established that only 35% of CAFs isolated from primary breast carcinomas were \u03b1SMA-positive, and that this mirrored the expression of \u03b1SMA in normal breast fibroblasts. Yet other studies characterize CAFs by elevated stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) expression. Sugimoto and colleagues demonstrate that the expression of commonly used \u201cCAF-markers\u201d, including \u03b1SMA, vimentin, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) do not overlap with each other. Thus, they conclude that CAFs are a heterogeneous population and that the use of these markers alone will not suffice to identify all CAFs. We speculate, therefore, that multiple CAF subpopulations exist and suggest that they evolve from a variety of origins.Indeed, Orimo and Weinberg have proposed three models by which CAFs are derived in human carcinomas: clonal selection of a group of fibroblasts or progenitors that have acquired genetic alterations; transdifferentiation of normal stromal fibroblasts, without acquiring genetic alterations; and differentiation of stromal fibroblasts recruited from specialized progenitor cells in circulation. Studies support the notion that CAFs are either derived from bone marrow progenitor cells and/or that they evolve from the conversion of normal mammary fibroblasts or other resident cells, such as endothelial cells or epithelial cancer cells.We are interested in the mechanism(s) by which breast cancer cells solicit normal, human resident mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) to produce inflammatory and tumor-promoting factors, and thus become activated and CAF-like, and/or mature CAFs. Little is known about the molecular determinants of the transformation of an HMF to a CAF. In the current study, we examined the transdifferentiation of primary normal resident HMFs to activated fibroblasts, or to acquire CAF-like phenotype, in response to breast cancer secreted factors. We measured factors that have previously been affiliated with CAFs and/or the activated fibroblasts found in sites of inflammation. Our data demonstrate that SUM102 breast cancer cells, which were derived from an intraductal breast carcinoma, secrete factors that stimulate normal HMFs to express tumor-enhancing, inflammatory-related factors, including matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and the G-protein coupled receptor, CXCR4.The neutral protease, MMP-1, is recognized as a critical factor in breast cancer metastasis, and its roles as a mediator of matrix degradation and as a modulator of cell behavior have been established. However, no study has examined MMP-1 expression and function during the transition from an HMF to a CAF, nor has the function of this protease been identified in CAF isolates from breast cancer patients, although it has been associated with matrix remodeling by activated fibroblasts in inflammation.The overexpression of chemokines and their receptors, such as CXCR4, is also well documented as a key stimulus in promoting breast cancer tumorigenesis. Classically, CXCR4 is markedly upregulated on breast cancer cells, allowing them to migrate to targeted distant organs containing cells that secrete its ligand, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1). However, it has also been documented that CXCR4 expression is elevated in fibroblasts in inflammatory environments other than cancer. For example, synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis display constitutively expressed CXCR4 mRNA and cell surface protein. Similarly, studies show that fibroblasts from mice with pulmonary fibrosis express CXCR4 and respond chemotactically to SDF-1. Because the cancer microenvironment has been equated to a chronic site of inflammation, we propose that like activated fibroblasts in inflammatory conditions, CAFs also increase CXCR4 levels and that this contributes to breast cancer progression.Our study illustrates that MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels are increased in primary HMFs treated with factors secreted by breast cancer cells, and that MMP-1 and CXCR4 are functionally important for downstream signaling, cell migration, and matrix degradation. Notably, we use normal, primary HMFs in these studies to avoid potential artifacts, such as a spontaneous increase in CXCR4 following immortalization with telomerase. Importantly, we also demonstrate increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression and function in CAF isolates from primary breast tumors, compared to counterpart, non-tumor-associated fibroblasts from the same patient, signifying that our findings are clinically relevant. Together, our data suggest that breast cancer cells secrete growth factors and chemokines that stimulate normal resident HMFs to become CAF-like.RESULTSHuman mammary fibroblasts promote tumor engraftment and growth of 102 breast cancer cellsSUM102 (102) breast cancer cells were derived from an intraductal breast carcinoma and are ER-/PR-, suggesting that they are phenotypically aggressive. Since MMP-1 and CXCR4 mediate breast cancer invasion and metastasis by MDA-MB 231 (231) breast cancer cells in vivo, we compared MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression in 102 breast cancer cells to that of the well-established, aggressive 231 breast cancer cells. Compared to 102 cells, MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA was greater in 231 cells by approximately 35-fold and 70-fold, respectively (Figure 1A), indicating that the 102 cells do not express the same parameters as the 231 cells. Unlike 231 cells, which readily form tumors in vivo, when 102 cells were injected orthotopically into the 4th mammary fat pad of nude mice, they were weakly tumorigenic (Figure 1B), suggesting that tumorigenesis in these cells may depend on stromal/tumor cell interactions.Reports have documented that either non-cancer associated, normal human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) or carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) enhance breast tumor growth when injected simultaneously with mammary carcinoma cells into nude mice using an orthotopic model. We used this model to examine the functional ramifications of the molecular interactions between weakly tumorigenic 102 breast cancer cells and HMFs isolated from cancer free mammary tissues: 102 breast cancer cells were injected orthotopically into nude mice in the presence or absence of HMFs (Figure 1B). After 6 months, 100% of mice with concomitant injections of 102 breast cancer cells and HMFs developed tumors, while only ~33% of mice injected with 102 cells alone displayed tumors of modest size (~5mm) (P=0.0027) (Table 1). Moreover, when 102 breast cancer cells were co-injected with HMFs, larger tumors (~10mm) formed than when 102 cells were injected alone (***P=0.0006) (Figure 1B and Table 1). Cell number could not explain this finding, since twice as many 102 cells were injected into mice receiving only the tumor cells. Further, mice injected with HMFs alone yielded no tumors (Figure 1B and Table 1). Thus, we conclude that tumor formation and growth are augmented when mice were co-injected with 102 cells and HMFs, suggesting that 102 breast cancer progression is enhanced by the presence of human mammary fibroblasts. Soluble factors secreted by breast cancer cells up-regulate specific tumor-enhancing genes in nearby fibroblasts. We hypothesized therefore, that the weakly tumorigenic 102 breast cancer cells secrete soluble factors that aid in the transdifferentiation of resident mammary fibroblasts to tumor-promoting, activated fibroblasts, that are CAFs or CAF-like, and that subsequently, these activated stromal cells up-regulate inflammatory mediators that facilitate tumor progression.102 breast cancer cells stimulate the expression of tumor-promoting genes that are associated with cancer and inflammation in normal mammary fibroblastsTo determine whether factors produced by 102 carcinoma cells affect HMF gene expression, causing these stromal cells to gain an activated, CAF-like phenotype, we used real-time RT-PCR to measure the expression of a panel of genes known to be associated with CAFs and/or activated fibroblasts. Compared to control HMFs, treated with HMF cell conditioned media (HMFCM), HMFs treated with 102 cell conditioned media (102CM) exhibited significantly increased levels of several genes that have been previously associated with activated fibroblasts present in inflammatory situations and CAFs: MMP-1, MMP-3, IL-8, and SDF-1 (Figure 2A). Notably, these genes also promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis. As expected when studying primary cells from an out-bred population, we observed inherent differences in the responsiveness of HMFs treated with 102CM. Nonetheless, of the 12 primary HMF samples tested, ~70% were responsive.These data suggest that HMFs become activated or CAF-like in response to 102CM, and thus acquire an enhanced tumor-promoting phenotype following exposure to soluble breast cancer factors. However, 102CM did not induce other genes, including several classic CAF-related genes: FAP, \u03b1SMA, vimentin, and VEGF within 24h (data not shown). This finding suggests that resident HMFs, which become activated and CAF-like, may represent a distinct sub-population of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. It is also feasible that HMFs may require additional environmental cues, which are absent in vitro, in order to transform into mature CAFs. Alternatively, other studies have shown that fibroblast precursor cells only express CAF-related genes, such SDF-1, \u03b1SMA and FAP, after 30 days of exposure to breast cancer CM.Perhaps most interestingly, we found that HMFs exhibited elevated CXCR4 mRNA levels in response to 102CM (Figure 2B), since overexpression of this receptor is usually associated with invasive breast cancer cells (see Figure 1A), while CAFs are recognized for secreting increased amounts of its ligand, SDF-1. As noted earlier, we also detected SDF-1 gene induction in HMFs exposed to 102CM (see Figure 2A). Elevated CXCR4 expression on breast cancer cells has been correlated with augmented angiogenesis and directional migration. Thus, CXCR4 induction in resident fibroblasts implies that these cells may also contribute to tumorigenesis, invasion and migration. We conclude that 102CM induces the expression of genes associated with activated fibroblasts and/or CAFs, and we will focus on MMP-1 and CXCR4 because of their documented importance in breast cancer progression. To emphasize the broad significance of this finding, media conditioned by 231 breast cancer cells, or their lung metastatic derivative, LM2 cells, also induced MMP-1 (top panels) and CXCR4 (bottom panels) mRNA in HMFs within 24h (Figure 2C). Due to the low levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 in the 102 cells, compared to those in the aggressive 231 cells (see Figure 1A) and LM2 cells (data not shown), the 102 cells represent a stronger model for examining the functional contribution of stromal-derived MMP-1 and CXCR4 in breast cancer progression. Thus, we focus on the effects made by 102 breast cancer cells on surrounding fibroblasts.Time course of MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels in HMFs exposed to soluble 102 breast cancer factorsTo define the time course of MMP-1 and CXCR4 induction in HMFs, mRNA was measured following treatment of these cells with 102CM or control HMFCM. Both MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA in HMFs increased steadily from 3h to 24h of exposure to 102CM (Figure 3A), while levels of these mRNAs were unchanged in HMFs treated with control media, HMFCM. Both MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression returned to original levels within 3h upon removal of the breast cancer cell CM (data not shown). Depending on the HMF sample, the relative fold change in CXCR4 between 102CM-treated HMFs and control HMFs ranged from 10-fold to over 50-fold, while fold change in MMP-1 induction ranged from 2-fold to 10-fold (data not shown).Western blot analysis confirmed that protein levels correlated with gene induction. Neither HMFCM, nor 102CM alone generated measurable levels of latent or active MMP-1 (Figure 3B, left panel), confirming that basal MMP-1 levels in HMFs and 102 cells are low. However, 102CM triggered the secretion of both latent and active MMP-1 in HMFs, compared to HMFs treated with control media, HMFCM (Figure 3B, right panel). Bands larger than 52kDa in the CM represent glycosylated MMP-1. Similarly, high levels of CXCR4 protein were detected in HMFs treated with 102CM after 12h, while little CXCR4 was detected in HMFs treated with HMFCM (Figure 3C). HMF-derived CXCR4 protein diminished by 24h of treatment with 102CM (Figure 3C), possibly due to the increase in SDF-1 mRNA (Figure 3D), which typically ranged from 2- to 10-fold (data not shown). Indeed, the kinetic profile of SDF-1 is such that if SDF-1 levels begin to increase at 16h, it is possible that this chemokine is generated and binds CXCR4, causing internalization and degradation of this receptor by 24h ( and see Discussion). Media conditioned by 231 and LM2 breast cancer cells also induced MMP-1 and CXCR4 protein levels in HMFs within 24h (data not shown).Functional significance of increased stromal MMP-1 in the absence of breast cancer cell-derived MMP-1To demonstrate the functional importance of MMP-1 in HMFs, we used an in vitro collagen degradation assay, in which HMFs were embedded in a collagen gel and incubated with control HMFCM or 102CM. Immunohistochemistry detected MMP-1 protein produced by HMFs embedded in a collagen matrix when subjected to either HMFCM or 102CM for 6h (Figure 4A). While HMFs treated with 102CM stained positively for MMP-1, only a few cells treated with HMFCM were partially stained (see arrows), despite the equal number of cells per gel. Furthermore, collagen surrounding HMFs treated with 102CM displayed punctate MMP-1 staining throughout, indicating that these cells actively secreted MMP-1. In contrast, MMP-1 was not present in HMF-embedded gels treated with HMFCM.While very little degradation resulted when collagen-embedded HMFs were treated with HMFCM for 48h, collagen degradation by HMFs treated with 102CM was extensive, as measured by the amount of media liberated from the collagen as it was degraded (***P<0.0001) (Figure 4B). The negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. To confirm MMP-1 as the agent responsible for the collagen degradation, an MMP-1 neutralizing antibody was added to the collagen, and HMF-driven degradation of collagen was prevented (Figure 4C). Similarly, addition of a general MMP inhibitor, Ilomastat, abrogated collagen degradation (*P<0.05) (Figure 4C). Again, the negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. These data imply that weakly invasive 102 breast cancer cells, which do not produce MMP-1 (Figure 3B), can exploit nearby fibroblasts to produce MMP-1, resulting in the degradation of surrounding ECM.CXCR4 on HMFs stimulates downstream signaling and allows cells to migrate in response to exogenous SDF-1It has been demonstrated that cell-surface CXCR4 may be present on cells, but unresponsive to SDF-1 stimulation, as measured by downstream signaling. Since SDF-1 is the only known ligand for CXCR4, we determined whether SDF-1 successfully signaled through HMF CXCR4 by measuring the activation of p44/42 (Erk1/2), a component of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Addition of SDF-1 to HMFs for 5 minutes stimulated the phosphorylation of p44/42, indicating the activation of this pathway (Figure 5A, left panel). To confirm SDF-1 signaling through activation of CXCR4, cells were pretreated with a CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100, and subsequently treated with SDF-1 for 0 or 5 minutes. Inhibition of CXCR4 blunted p44/42 phosphorylation by SDF-1 (Figure 5A, right panel), allowing us to conclude that upon binding to CXCR4, SDF-1 stimulates downstream signal transduction in HMFs. The partial inhibition observed with AMD3100 most likely reflects the fact that this MAPK pathway is activated by other mechanisms in these cells ( and data not shown).Standard chemotaxis assays were conducted to investigate the downstream function of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling axis in HMFs stimulated with HMFCM or 102CM. These functional experiments also confirm that the increased total CXCR4 protein observed by western blot analysis results in increased surface CXCR4. Figure 5B represents a qualitative analysis of these results, which are quantified in Figure 5C. As expected, HMFs migrated toward FBS (positive control), but not toward BSA (negative vehicle control). Although HMFs treated with control HMFCM failed to migrate toward SDF-1, HMFs exposed to 102CM, and which therefore have increased CXCR4 levels (see Figure 3), migrated readily toward SDF-1 (***P=0.0001) (Figure 5B and C). To corroborate CXCR4 as the key mediator in HMF migration toward SDF-1, the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, was used to block CXCR4 signaling. Blocking CXCR4 reduced HMF migration toward SDF-1 by ~2\u20133 fold, as is evident in Figure 5B and C (***P=0.0016). Taken together, these data confirm that breast cancer cells secrete factors that not only induce CXCR4 protein levels in HMFs, but also that this receptor responds to its ligand by transmitting downstream signals and enhancing migration.MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein are increased in primary CAFs compared to their counterpart fibroblasts and HMFsTo ascertain whether our observations were clinically relevant, we investigated MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression and function in CAFs isolated from primary human breast tumors, their respective (non-cancer-associated) counterpart fibroblasts (CPFs), and age-matched, HMFs from patients without cancer (Figure 6A). Basal MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA levels in CPFs were similar to those in normal, unstimulated HMFs, suggesting that non-tumor associated fibroblasts collected from patients with breast cancer have comparable MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression to those observed in HMFs taken from patients not afflicted with cancer. In contrast, basal expression of these genes was significantly higher in CAFs, demonstrating that clinically derived CAFs have constitutively increased levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA (*P<0.05) (Figure 6A). 102CM further stimulated MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA levels in HMFs, CPFs, and CAFs, suggesting that regardless of cell type, soluble factors from breast cancer cells stimulate the expression of these tumor-promoting genes (Figure 6A). To confirm their status as CAFs, we examined these cells for increased expression of a CAF-recognized gene, FAP, and found it to be elevated compared to FAP mRNA in CPFs (data not shown).Constitutive MMP-1 (top panel) and CXCR4 (bottom panel) protein levels were also increased in CAFs compared to HMFs and CPFs (Figure 6B). The multiple banding pattern for both MMP-1 and CXCR4 protein results from glycosylation. Flow cytometry detected increased CXCR4 surface expression on ~1.0% of CAFs, compared to ~0.1% of HMFs (Figure 6C). The percentage of cells expressing CXCR4 over time is likely higher than the values obtained, because CXCR4 is rapidly internalized, making it difficult to detect. Importantly, flow cytometry revealed that 10-fold more CAFs express CXCR4 than HMFs, and of these cells, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CAFs was consistently greater than the MFI of HMFs (data not shown). Because CXCR4 is rapidly internalized, this method of determining CXCR4 surface expression may be less definitive than a functional assay (see below).Migratory and invasive capabilities are increased in primary CAFs compared to their counterpart fibroblasts and HMFsTo measure the functionality of CAF-derived MMP-1, we assessed the ability of these cells to degrade collagen in the collagen degradation assay. HMFs and CPFs treated with naive, serum-free medium did not degrade the type I collagen. In contrast, CAFs readily degraded the collagen matrix, except when MMP-1 was neutralized with an antibody (Figure 7A). The negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. These findings confirm and expand on previous studies, demonstrating that CAFs derived from clinical specimens not only maintain increased MMP-1 levels, but also that this fibroblast-derived enzyme degrades surrounding matrix, suggesting a role for these cells in vivo.To investigate whether CAF-expressed CXCR4 promoted chemotaxis toward SDF-1, these cells were examined in a standard migration assay. CAFs migrated readily toward SDF-1, while CPFs and HMFs did not (**P<0.001) (Figure 7B), and that the degree of migration corresponded with the relative levels of CXCR4 in these cells. Each of the primary cell lines migrated toward 10% FBS, the positive control, but were not attracted toward the negative vehicle control, 0.1% BSA (Figure 7B). Importantly, blocking CXCR4 function with AMD3100 abrogated CAF migration (***P=0.001) (Figure 7C), indicating that CAF-derived CXCR4 is necessary for the migration toward SDF-1 and demonstrating that CXCR4 expressed on these cells is functional.Thus, we conclude that CAF specimens derived from clinical material express increased MMP-1 and CXCR4, which potentiate the invasive and migratory phenotype of these cells. These results validate the clinical relevancy of our findings with HMFs treated with 102CM, since HMFs treated with 102CM share characteristics with CAFs obtained from patient specimens. Further, the data support the concept that inflammatory factors provided by breast cancer cells may initiate the HMF-to-CAF transdifferentiation.DISCUSSIONSome CAFs have been compared to the activated fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, present in sites of wound healing and chronic inflammation. Myofibroblasts at sites of inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression, which facilitate cellular invasion and migration. Taken together, these observations support our hypothesis that MMP-1 and CXCR4 may also be elevated in fibroblasts that are found within the breast tumor microenvironment and suggest that these factors are induced as an HMF becomes more activated and CAF-like.In this report, we provide evidence to support this hypothesis. First, our data show that SUM102 breast cancer cells, which express low levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4, require mammary fibroblasts to grow in vivo (Figure 1). Second, the SUM102 cells secrete factors that stimulate the expression of several inflammatory factors, including MMP-1 and CXCR4, in adjacent stromal cells (Figures 1 and 2). This suggests that 102 breast cancer cells may solicit normal, resident HMFs to facilitate tumor growth in vivo. Further, increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 enhanced the invasive and migratory behavior of HMFs, verifying functional contributions of these cells to tumor progression (Figures 4 and 5). Finally, we validated these findings by demonstrating that mammary CAF isolates from patients with breast cancer have amplified basal MMP-1 and CXCR4 levels, which augment their invasive and migratory potential, respectively (Figures 6 and 7). In vivo, this phenotype may permit CAFs to degrade matrix as they migrate within the tumor microenvironment. Our findings emphasize the possible clinical relevance of MMP-1 and CXCR4 induction in CAFs, and demonstrate that normal HMFs exposed to soluble breast cancer factors acquire phenotypic characteristics shared with CAF specimens (Figures 6 and 7), indicating that breast cancer cells may initiate the conversion of resident HMFs to CAFs.The process of matrix invasion by malignant cells requires both degradation of the matrix and cellular migration. Studies conducted previously in our laboratory demonstrated that MMP-1 derived from breast cancer cells is necessary for tumor growth and invasion at the primary site. Since MMP-1 is secreted, it is reasonable to propose that stromal-derived MMP-1 functions similarly to that produced by the breast cancer cells. Furthermore, not all breast cancer cells produce MMP-1, increasing the importance of CAF-derived MMP-1 in tumor progression.CXCR4 up-regulation is most commonly linked to breast cancer epithelial cells; on the other hand, the ligand for CXCR4, SDF-1, has been classified as CAF-related. In this report, we have identified CXCR4 as a novel CAF-associated gene. This finding, coupled with the discovery that CAFs express increased levels of SDF-1, imply that an autocrine feedback loop may exist. It is possible that SDF-1 produced by CAFs binds to and signals through, CAF CXCR4, potentially causing important downstream effects. Specifically, the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling axis results in a multitude of cellular functions: migration, homing, adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and the induction of MMPs. For example, SDF-1 signaling through CXCR4 on the activated fibroblasts in patients with rheumatoid arthritis results in their activation, migration and proliferation. Several breast cancer cell lines also secrete SDF-1; thus, it is feasible that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis functions not only in an autocrine manner, but also in paracrine fashion within the tumor microenvironment, where SDF-1 produced by tumor cells binds to CXCR4 on surrounding CAFs and vice-versa.Breast cancer cells over-expressing CXCR4 home to organs constitutively expressing SDF-1, such as the lungs, liver and bone, yet the in vivo function of CXCR4 on CAFs is currently unknown. Nonetheless, the in vivo function of CXCR4 on fibroblasts in other inflammatory diseases has been well documented and cancers have been likened to a wound that does not heal. For example, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibroblast precursor cells expressing CXCR4 have been shown to home to the lungs, which express elevated levels of SDF-1, thereby indicating that activated fibroblasts have the ability to migrate in vivo. Since we show that CXCR4 on CAFs is functional and that these cells are endowed with the ability to migrate towards SDF-1, we speculate that CAFs may migrate throughout the microenvironment of the primary tumor, degrading collagen through the secretion of MMP-1.A comprehensive list of CAF marker designations has not been definitively established. Instead, these cells have been associated with a variety of markers. Because CAFs may arise from various sources, it is not surprising that these cells could express different markers, and as a result, contribute to carcinogenesis differently. We did not observe increased levels of FAP, vimentin, and \u03b1SMA in HMFs exposed to soluble breast cancer factors. However, we document that normal HMFs increase several other CAF-related genes (see Figure 2A), including IL-8, SDF-1, MMP-3 and MMP-1. In addition, we demonstrated increased CXCR4 in CAFs and in HMFs in response to factors secreted by 102 breast cancer cells, a factor which has not previously been associated with CAFs. Since MMP-1 and CXCR4 are elevated in CAF isolates from the clinic, we suggest that the induction of specific genes by 102CM may represent an early transition phase of an HMF into a CAF and that these gene products facilitate breast cancer cell invasion and dissemination. Additionally, perhaps the high constitutive levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 seen in the CAFs taken from patients have resulted from genetic alterations made within these cells.Despite reports documenting that normal HMFs or CAFs enhance tumor growth when injected simultaneously with mammary carcinoma cells into nude mice, it has also been proposed that normal HMFs can suppress breast tumor formation in vivo. Indeed, then, it would be reasonable to propose that early in tumor formation normal, resident mammary fibroblasts suppress tumor growth, but that following the breast cancer cell-induced transition of HMFs to CAFs, these cells enhance tumor pathogenesis. Alternatively, it is possible that HMFs require prolonged treatment with breast cancer cell CM. This concept coincides with data from Mishra and colleagues, who showed that fibroblast precursor cells become fully CAF-like (as determined by SDF-1, \u03b1SMA and FAP expression) after 30 days of exposure to breast cancer CM.In conclusion, we demonstrate that CAFs display amplified MMP-1 and CXCR4 and that normal HMFs acquire enhanced MMP-1 and CXCR4 levels in response to soluble breast cancer agents. Our data suggest that breast cancer cells may initiate the conversion of normal, resident HMFs to CAFs.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and cell cultureSUM102 breast cancer cells (Asterand, Detroit, MI) were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 2% FBS, 5\u03bcg/mL insulin, 10ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1ug/mL hydrocortisone, Hepes Buffer, 100U/mL penicillin and 100ug/mL streptomycin. MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Rockville, MD) and their lung metastatic derivative (LM2, a kind gift from Dr. Massague at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) 50/50 F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. Primary human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were isolated from women who had undergone reduction mammoplasty surgery (Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center) and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. All patients were enlisted in an IRB-approved protocol. Primary carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their respective counterpart fibroblasts (CPFs) (Asterand) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. All cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and in 5% CO2. All primary cells were used between passages 2 and 6.Breast tumorigenesis in vivoCells were suspended in 100\u03bcl of Matrigel\u00ae (BD Biosciences), and female mice (strain nu/nu, ~49 days old, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were injected orthotopically (4th mammary fat pad) with 2\u00d7106 SUM102 cells, 2\u00d7106 HMFs, or 1\u00d7106 of each cell line simultaneously. Eight mice were injected concomitantly with both cell lines, while six mice were injected with each cell line alone. Tumors were measured biweekly with calipers, and mice were sacrificed when tumor diameter exceeded 12mm, or at the termination of the study (6 months). The Dartmouth College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal studies.Generation of conditioned mediaTo condition media, cells were plated at 5\u00d7106 cells (102 breast cancer cells) or 1\u00d7106 (HMFs) per 150mm plate (~85% confluence) and left to seed for 24h in serum-containing media. The cells were then rinsed three times with Hank\u2019s Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and 15mL of serum-free Ham\u2019s F12 media, containing 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate (LH), were added per 150mm culture plate and conditioned for 24h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, media were transferred to a conical tube, centrifuged at 1500rpm for 5 minu tes to pellet cellular debris, and then decanted into a new conical tube. Conditioned media (CM) were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed for experiments, at which time the media were thawed and added directly to cells.Quantitative real-time RT-PCRTotal cellular RNA was purified using Qiagen\u2019s RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Total cellular RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan Reverse Transcriptase reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as directed by the manufacturer. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using 250ng of input RNA per reaction, as described. Data were averaged and normalized to the housekeeping gene, hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). mRNA values were calculated using 2\u2212(\u0394\u0394C(t)) and are presented as fold change compared to control conditions. Primer sequences were: CXCR4: 5\u2032-TGGGTGGTTGTGTTCCAGTTT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ATGCAATAGCAGGACAGGATGA-3\u2032 (reverse); HPRT: 5\u2032-AGCTTGCTGGTGAAAAGGAC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CCAGATGTTTCCAAACTCAACTTGA-3\u2032 (reverse); IL-8: 5\u2032-CTCTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATT3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TATGCACTGACATCTAAGTTCTTTAGC-3\u2032 (reverse); MMP-1: 5\u2032-AGCTAGCTCAGGATGACATTGATG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GCCGATGGGCTGGACAG-3\u2032 (reverse); MMP-3: 5\u2032-TTCCGCCTGTCTCAAGATGATAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AAAGGACAAAGCAGGATCACAGTT-3\u2032 (reverse); SDF-1: 5\u2032-CACATGTTGAACCTCTTGTTTAAAAGC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AACGCCAAGGTCGTGGTCGTGCTG-3\u2032 (reverse). cDNAs were assayed in triplicate.In vitro collagen degradation assayThis assay was carried out as previously described. Briefly, neutralized collagen was mixed with equivalent volumes of cells to yield 5\u00d7105 cells/mL and 500\u03bcl of the collagen/cell mixture was added to each well of a 24-well plate. After the collagen solidified at 37\u00b0C (~15 minutes), 0.5mL of control HMF cell conditioned media (HMFCM) or 102 cell conditioned media (102CM) containing ~0.00003% trypsin to activate latent MMPs was added carefully to each well in the presence or absence of anti-FLAG antibody control (1\u03bcg/mL, Sigma), an MMP-1 neutralizing antibody (1\u03bcg/mL, Chemicon) or Illomastat (25\u03bcM, Chemicon). After 48h at 37\u00b0C, the overlying media were removed and weighed. The media released from a collagen gel were calculated by weighing the total media collected minus the original media added (0.5mL=0.5g). Samples were analyzed in triplicate and experiments were repeated at least three times. Assays stained for MMP-1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) were terminated at 6h, so that gels embedded with HMFs and treated with 102CM were not entirely degraded. Collagen gels were removed from wells with a rubber spatula, fixed in 1090 neutral buffered formaldehyde and processed for histological staining in the Pathology Department at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). Goat MMP-1 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was diluted to 1:100.Immunoblotting and antibodiesProteins from HMFs and 102 breast cancer cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. MMP-1 protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) from 1mL media, while CXCR4 was analyzed in whole cell lysates, which were suspended in 2x Laemmli lysis buffer (Sigma). Blots were probed with an MMP-1 antibody (Chemicon, Billerica, MA) diluted 1:2000, a CXCR4 anitbody (Chemicon) diluted 1:2000, phospho-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) diluted 1:1000, or actin antibodies (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) diluted 1:10,000. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:2000 in the appropriate blocking buffer.SDF-1/CXCR4 signalingHMFs were plated at 2.5\u00d7105 per 60 mm culture plate and allowed to seed overnight. After 24h, the cells were rinsed with HBSS and 102CM was added to all plates for 8h, after which time SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/ml, R&D Systems) was added for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, or 5 minutes and then cells were lysed in 150\u03bcl Laemmli buffer and prepared for immunoblotting for p44/42. Samples treated with AMD3100 (5\u03bcg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a small molecule inhibitor of CXCR4, were pretreated for 30 minutes, and then either vehicle control (0.1% BSA in 1X PBS) or SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/ml) was added for 5min.Migration assaysHMFs (5\u00d7104) were plated with media containing serum FluoroBlok\u2122 inserts (BD Falcon, 6.5mm, 8.0\u03bcm pore) as described previously, and allowed to seed overnight. The following morning, cells were rinsed with HBSS and treated with either HMFCM or 102CM. After 8h, DMEM containing 10% FBS (positive control), 0.1% BSA in PBS (negative vehicle control), or SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/mL) was added to the bottom chambers. Samples treated with AMD3100 (5\u03bcg/mL) were pretreated 30 minutes prior to adding attractants. Cells were permitted to migrate for approximately 18h, after which time the transwell inserts were exposed to the fluoroscent dye, Calcein AM (4\u03bcg/mL in HBSS, BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ), to visualize and count only cells that had migrated through the membrane. Migration assays with CAFs were conducted similarly, but rather than using FluoroBlok\u2122 inserts, standard transwell inserts (Corning, 6.5mm, 8.0\u03bcm pore) were used. To analyze migration with this method, transwell inserts were exposed to Calcein AM for 30 minutes, and then cells on the bottom were detached by incubating inserts in pre-warmed trypsin with agitation for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Medium containing 10% FBS was added to neutralize trypsin and pipetted to disperse cells evenly off the membrane. Cells were incubated for 3h and then were visualized by GFP fluorescence using excitation from a 100W Mercury lamp on an Olympus 1\u00d750 inverted phase contrast microscope and counted to quantify cell migration.Flow cytometryHMFs or CAFs were grown to confluence in 150mm plates and serum-starved overnight prior to being harvested for analysis of surface CXCR4 by flow cytometry. On the day of harvest, cells were rinsed with 1XPBS and incubated in acidic glycine buffer (0.05M glycine HCl buffer, pH 3, w/0.1M NaCl) for 1minute to ensure that stable receptors were stabilized, and then rinsed twice in 1X PBS. Pre-warmed Cell Stripper (a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution from Sigma) together with gentle scraping removed cells from the plates, and cells were immediately added to cold PBS with 10% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide and centrifuged. The supernatant was decanted and cells were either left unstained or stained with an anti-human CXCR4-PE-conjugated antibody (R&D Systems, Cat. #FAB170P) (diluted 1:50) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C and in the dark. After staining cells, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldahyde for 20 minutes and subsequently washed 3 times in cold PBS with 10% FBS. Cells were then resuspended in PBS supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide, and were analyzed using FacScan.Statistical analysisStudent\u2019s t test determined statistical significance. All samples were prepared in triplicate and experiments were conducted at least three times. Statistical power at the P<0.05 was considered significant.Figures and TableHuman mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) enhance tumor engraftment and growth of SUM102 breast cancer cells in vivo. A.

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay. Shown are representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (no treatment [NT]) after 24 h. (B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3).

(C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027).

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

(E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The SUM-159 human triple negative cell line was obtained from Asterand Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA) and was cultured in HAMS:F12 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone 1% HEPES. The MCF7 luminal A human breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 10% FBS. Cell lines were authenticated via third party testing (IDEXX BioAnalytics, Columbia, MO, USA) between October 2018 and October 2019. The MCF10A cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 5% FBS + 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was obtained from Dr. Ann Chambers (London Health Science Centre, London, Canada) and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS. The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and bone marrow (BM) was immediately extracted and stained with primary anti-CD117-PE and anti-CD45-FITC antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Supplemental Figure S2. Cells (10,000/sample) were analyzed to assess differences in CD117+ cells within the total BM population. (a\u2013d) Representative flow cytometry histograms of the CD117+ BMDC population (gate F2) in (a) age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (controls for SUM159); (b) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice; (c) age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (controls for MCF7) and (d) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and either formalin-fixed or snap-frozen. (a\u2013g) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and stained with (a\u2013c) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or (e\u2013g) subjected to immunohistochemistry with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification for the presence of metastatic tumor cells (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a,e) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (b,f) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (c,g) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. (d) Positive control; MCF7 primary human breast tumor tissue. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels (a\u2013c) and top panels (d\u2013g) and high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels (a\u2013c) and bottom panels (d\u2013g). (h) DNA was isolated from snap-frozen lung tissue from tumor-na\u00efve control mice, MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and SUM159 tumor-bearing mice (n = 15/group) and subjected to qPCR analysis using primers specific to the human ALU sequence.Expression of the premetastatic niche markers fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 is enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, lungs were harvested and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against murine fibronectin (FN) (a,e,i); tenascin-c (TNC) (b,f,j); periostin (POSTN) (c,g,k) or MMP9 (d,h,l) prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/lung/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a\u2013d) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (e\u2013h) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (i\u2013l) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels); high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels).Mice bearing triple negative SUM159 tumors demonstrate increased mRNA expression of the premetastatic markers fibronection, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX and CCL2 in the lungs. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and snap-frozen.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and used for the generation of lung-conditioned media (LCM) as described previously. To assess migration, (a) SUM159 or (b) MCF7 cells were subjected to transwell migration assays for 18 h as described in the Materials & Methods. To assess proliferation, (c) SUM159 or (d) MCF7 cells were subjected to BrdU incorporation assays as described in the Materials & Methods.

        "content": "Accumulating evidence suggests that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit the growth of breast tumors by inhibiting the synthesis of estrogen. However, it remains unknown whether the aromatase inhibitor letrozole has an additional impact on CAFs, which further influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Primary CAFs were isolated from primary estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumors. Estrogen-deprived culture medium was used to exclude the influence of steroids. In co-culture, primary cultured CAFs increased MCF7 cell adhesion, invasion, migration and proliferation, and letrozole treatment inhibited these increases, except for the increase in proliferation. In total, 258 up-regulated genes and 47 down-regulated genes with an absolute fold change &gt;2 were identified in CAFs co-cultured with MCF7 cell after letrozole treatment. One up-regulated genes (POSTN) and seven down-regulated genes (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, IL-8, CXCL5, LEP and NGF) were further validated by real-time PCR. The changes in CCL2 and CXCL1 expression were further confirmed using an automated microscopic imaging-based, high content analysis platform. Although the results need further functional validation, this study is the first to describe the differential tumor-promoting phenotype of CAFs induced by letrozole and the associated gene expression alterations. Most importantly, our data revealed that down-regulation of several secreted factors (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1 etc.) in CAFs might be partially responsible for the efficacy of letrozole. ",

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min.

(B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm).

(C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay.

In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm.

MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay.

Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "content": "Breast cancer progression is promoted by stromal cells that populate the tumors, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). The activities of CAFs and MSCs in breast cancer are integrated within an intimate inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) that includes high levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). Here, we identified the impact of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 on the inflammatory phenotype of CAFs and MSCs by determining the expression of inflammatory chemokines that are well-characterized as pro-tumorigenic in breast cancer: CCL2 (MCP-1), CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL5 (RANTES). Chemokine expression was determined in breast cancer patient-derived CAFs by ELISA and in patient biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Chemokine levels were determined by ELISA in (1) human bone marrow-derived MSCs stimulated by tumor conditioned media (Tumor CM) of breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) at the end of MSC-to-CAF-conversion process; (2) Tumor CM-derived CAFs, patient CAFs and MSCs stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (and IL-1\u03b2).

Recent studies demonstrated that breast tumors are populated by myofibroblasts that express pro-cancerous functions, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Various origins of these cells may exist, including resident tissue fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) that have been continuously exposed to tumor-derived and TME constituents. Such MSCs, originating in bone marrow (BM) or adipose tissues generally have pro-cancerous effects that promote malignancy in many tumor systems, including breast cancer. In vitro, tumor cell products that are present in tumor-derived conditioned medium (CM) convert MSCs to CAFs which become fully and potently functional in promoting malignancy in vivo.The activities of CAFs and MSCs do not take place in the void, but rather are integrated in their intimate TME. In many cancers, the TME is dominated by inflammatory elements, including inflammatory leukocytes and inflammatory soluble factors that generally promote disease progression. The inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) are often present in the inflammatory milieu of many tumors. In contrast to tumor-cytotoxic effects caused by acute local TNF-\u03b1 administration, chronic and persistent presence of TNF-\u03b1 in tumors has strong pro-tumoral effects in many cancers. Accordingly, inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 or its receptors has prominent anti-tumor effects in animal models of breast cancer. In parallel, major causative pro-tumoral roles were attributed to IL-1\u03b2 in breast cancer via angiogenesis and matrix-remodeling activities. Overall, based on recent studies addressing the roles of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in malignancy, both cytokines are now considered potential targets for therapy in cancer.We recently reported that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were minimally expressed by normal breast epithelial cells, but were highly expressed in tumor cells of biopsies from most breast cancer patients. In such individuals, the elevated expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 was significantly correlated with relapse and advanced disease. Despite emerging information on the impact of these inflammatory cytokines on tumor-promoting events in stromal cells, their ability to shape the inflammatory phenotype of CAFs and MSCs has been only partly revealed.Recent studies indicate that CAFs and MSCs promote malignancy through the expression of inflammatory chemokines. In this respect, inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 MCP-1), CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL5 (RANTES) are of major relevance because they promote aggressiveness in tumor cells, they induce tumor-supporting effects in cells of the TME, and they play direct roles in advancing tumor growth and metastasis in many cancer diseases, including cancer of the breast. MSC-derived and CAF-derived inflammatory chemokines promote tumor progression by inducing the infiltration of pro-tumorigenic myeloid cells to tumors (such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)), increasing angiogenesis, elevating tumor cell stemness, invasion and proliferation, and promoting the recruitment of MSCs to primary tumors and metastases. Overall, the outcome of such chemokine activities is a pronounced promotion of cancer progression and tumor cell dissemination to distant organs.Our overall goal in this study was to investigate aspects of inflammation\u2013stroma interactions in breast cancer. To this end, we determined the influence of breast tumor-derived factors and of inflammatory cytokines on the inflammatory phenotype of CAFs and MSCs, manifested by the release of the pro-cancerous chemokines CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 by these cells. The novel findings obtained in this study show intensive inflammation\u2013stroma interactions that act specifically through the designated pathway of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation in stromal cells. Through these interactions, the inflammatory microenvironment shapes the tumor-promoting phenotype of MSCs and CAFs and may thus enhance tumor progression.MethodsBreast tumor cell culturesHuman breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and MCF-7 cells were kindly provided by Prof. Kaye, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. The MCF-7 cells were authenticated on the basis of published characteristics of MCF-7 cells by verifying that they express an active estrogen receptor alpha, respond to estrogen, express low levels of ErbB2, form tumors upon supplementation of estrogen and matrigel, and have low metastatic potential. These cells were grown in enriched Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM), including 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin, and 4 mM l-glutamine (Biological Industries, Beit Ha\u2019emek, Israel).Isolation of CAFs from patient breast tumorsCAFs were obtained from surgically resected breast tumors of patients who provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sheba Medical Center. Tissues were cut into small pieces, shaken overnight at 37\u00b0C in collagenase type 4 (250 U/ml, #S3J6523; Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ, USA) in DMEM, filtered (100 mm cell strainer; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and plated in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM l-glutamine, minimum essential medium nonessential amino acids, antibiotics and 60 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Biological Industries; and Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells propagated in these conditions had typical fibroblastic phenotype: their identity was verified by the absence of the epithelial marker cytokeratin and the presence of the typical mesenchymal markers vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1) and fibroblast-activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1) (Figure S1 in Additional file 1). The cells were routinely grown in medium as above or in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10 to 20% FBS with regular tissue culture additives.Two human patient-derived CAF isolates were generated and characterized for CAF phenotype as described above. CAFs #1 cells were derived from a lung metastasis of breast cancer and were immortalized by human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), as described previously. CAFs #2 cells were derived from a primary breast tumor of a different patient and were kept in culture without hTERT immortalization.Origins and growth of MSCsTwo sources of human BM-derived MSCs of healthy individuals were used in the study. First, in the earlier stages of the study, human MSCs were isolated from unprocessed BM of healthy individuals obtained from Lonza (Walkersville, MD, USA; Cambrex at that time) and were cultured in mesencult medium (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). Following establishment in culture, the isolated MSCs were cultured in \u03b1-minimum essential medium containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin (as in). In line with typical characteristics of MSCs, the isolated cells expressed CD44, CD105, CD90, HLA-ABC and Stro1, while they were negative for CD45, HLA-DR and CD11b (see; data not shown), as determined by flow cytometry using FITC-labeled antibodies (BD Biosciences). Expanded cultures of human BM-derived MSCs were analyzed for adipogenic, osteogenic and myogenic differentiation in vitro, to determine multipotency (data not shown). Second, at the advanced stages of the study, fully characterized MSCs were purchased from Lonza. As indicated in Lonza\u2019s datasheet, the cells had typical MSC characteristics. They expressed CD44, CD29, CD105, and CD166 and did not express CD45, CD14 and CD34. Also, the cells can differentiate to adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages when cultured in the recommended differentiation medium. The cells were thawed into enriched mesencult medium (Stemcell Technologies Inc.) and then were subcultured every 5 to 7 days in enriched DMEM medium. In all cases, cell growth was continued in DMEM medium for a limited number of passages (generally up to 10 passages).Long-term growth of MSCs with Tumor CM, followed by TNF-\u03b1 stimulationMDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast tumor cells were grown in enriched DMEM culture medium (as above). Tumor CM from these cancer cells was collected after 18 to 24 hours, centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 minutes and supernatants were passed through sterile filters with 0.45 \u03bcm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). MSCs were exposed to such fresh Tumor CM twice a week for a ~30-day time period, following the protocol described in that has generated CAFs which promoted tumor growth in vivo in past experiments. In parallel, control MSCs from the same initiating cell stock were cultured with enriched DMEM medium. To verify the CAF-like phenotype of cells generated by this process (termed herein CAFs), in this study we used criteria of modified morphology and typical CAF markers: the expression of vimentin, upregulation of \u03b1SMA expression (Figure S2 in Additional file 1) and elevated expression of FSP1 (performed for MCF-7 CM only; data not shown).CAFs obtained by stimulating MSCs for ~30 days and their control MSCs were trypsinized, centrifuged and counted. The cells were plated at equivalent density and, following an additional 24 hours of incubation, supernatants from the differentiated CAFs and from control MSCs were frozen in \u221220\u00b0C. In parallel, an aliquot of the original Tumor CM was frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. All supernatants were then thawed at the same time (from CAFs obtained by incubation with Tumor CM, from control MSCs that were grown for the same time period and the CM of the tumor cells themselves) for determination of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 levels in these supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).In other assays, this same procedure was utilized in the presence of short stimulation by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), carried out during the last 24 hours of culture. TNF-\u03b1 working concentrations were chosen based on criteria described next in Stimulation of MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. As control for TNF-\u03b1, the cells were incubated with the vehicle of the cytokine (0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 levels in cell supernatants were determined by ELISA.Stimulation of MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2MSCs were cultured for 24 hours in enriched DMEM medium. The medium was then removed, and cells were incubated for 24 hours in medium containing TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) or IL-1\u03b2 (500 pg/ml) (PeproTech). Cytokine working concentrations were chosen based on calibrations performed in other cell systems in our laboratory and are in the accepted range used in vitro in other studies (several selected publications). Chemokine expression in cell supernatants was determined by ELISA. In controls, we verified that the vehicle of the cytokines (0.1% BSA) did not induce chemokine release by the MSCs.In specific cases, neutralizing antibodies or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were used. For experiments with antibodies to TNF-\u03b1 receptors, MSCs were plated in enriched DMEM medium for 24 hours. The cells were then washed and incubated in DMEM medium supplemented with 1% FBS, in the presence of neutralizing antibodies for tumor necrosis factor receptors TNF-RI and TNF-RII (10 \u03bcg/ml, #MAB225 and #MAB726, respectively; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or isotype-matched nonrelevant antibody control (10 \u03bcg/ml, #400101; BioLegend, Roselle, San Diego, USA) for 1 hour. Antibody concentrations were chosen based on preliminary analyses, in which several concentrations of neutralizing antibodies were tested (data not shown). Following this incubation period, TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) or its vehicle (as above) was added to cells. After 24 hours, cell supernatants were collected for ELISA assays.For experiments with siRNAs to c-Jun or p65, MSCs were plated in enriched DMEM medium for 24 hours. The cells were then transiently transfected with siRNA to c-Jun (60 nM, #L-003268-00; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA), siRNA to p65 (30 nM, #MU-003533-02; Dharmacon; kindly provided by Prof. Wiemann, DKFZ, Heidelberg Germany) or control siRNA (same concentrations) by Lipofectamine RNAiMAX\u2122 transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cells were washed and incubated in DMEM medium overnight, and then stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 (25 ng/ml; a suboptimal concentration of TNF-\u03b1 was used in order to facilitate detection of inhibitory effects) for 24 to 48 hours. Cell supernatants were collected for ELISA assays.MSC stimulation by CM derived from MDA-MB-231 cells, transfected with TNF-\u03b1-expressing vectorMDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector or with the same vector coding for human TNF-\u03b1, by ICAFectin\u2122 441 DNA transfection reagent (InCellArt, Nantes, France) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After 24 hours, Tumor CM was harvested and TNF-\u03b1 expression was determined by ELISA, as described below. In parallel, on the day of MDA-MB-231 cell transfection, MSCs were plated in enriched DMEM medium. The MSCs were then incubated for 24 hours with Tumor CM from MDA-MB-231 cells transfected by control vector or by TNF-\u03b1-expressing vector, or with enriched DMEM medium as control. Part of the above MDA-MB-231 Tumor CM was frozen in \u221220\u00b0C, as was also the case for CM of MSCs alone. All CM was then thawed at the same time (from MSCs stimulated with supernatants of MDA-MB-231 cells transfected by control vector or by TNF-\u03b1-expressing vector, from control MSCs and the CM of the tumor cells themselves). As appropriate, CCL2, CXCL8, CCL5 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in these supernatants were determined by ELISA.Stimulation of patient CAFs by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2CAFs #1 and CAFs #2 isolates were cultured for 24 hours in CAF growth medium (as above). The cells were then washed twice in LPM starvation medium (Biological Industries), and incubated for 48 hours in LPM starvation medium in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (500 pg/ml) or cytokine vehicle (as above). CCL5 levels in the supernatants of the cells were determined by ELISA.Confocal analysesHuman BM-derived MSCs that were grown in the absence of or in the presence of MDA-MB-231-derived or MCF-7-derived Tumor CM for ~30 days (as above) were cultured for 24 hours on sterilized cover slips at 37\u00b0C. The cells were washed, fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% triton, blocked with 2% BSA in PBS, and then incubated with antibodies against \u03b1SMA (#A-2547; Sigma-Aldrich) and vimentin (#sc-6260; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Negative controls included samples in which the primary antibodies were replaced by isotype-matched nonrelevant antibody controls (data not shown). The cells were then stained with the secondary antibodies, as appropriate. In parallel, cells were counterstained with the nuclear dye 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cell-coated cover slips were removed from the wells, embedded in mounting gel and imaged by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510; Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).Polymerase chain reactions (PCR)To determine the expression of human TNF receptors, total RNA was isolated by the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400-100; Biological Industries) from patient CAFs #1 and CAFs #2 isolates, from MSCs and from HL-60 cells that served as positive control. First-strand complementary DNA was generated using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The expression of TNF-RI (TNFRSF1A) and TNF-RII (TNFRSF1B) was determined using the following primers: TNF-RI, forward 5\u2032-GCACTGCCGCTGCCACACT-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-AAGGCGATCTCGCAGGACG-3\u2032, expected PCR product size 1,480 base pairs; and TNF-RII, forward 5\u2032-ATGGCGCCCGTCGCCGTCT-3\u2032 and reverse 5\u2032-CCTGGTTAACTGGGCTTCATC-3\u2032, expected PCR product size 1,390 base pairs. PCR amplification of TNF-RI was performed over 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 90 seconds). PCR amplification of TNF-RII was performed over 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 65\u00b0C for 20 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 90 seconds). The sequence of the resulting PCR products was verified as TNF-RI and TNR-II. No-template controls were negative.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assaysELISA assays were performed in the linear range of absorbance using standard curves generated with recombinant proteins. The ELISA for CCL2 involved mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human CCL2 (#500-M71; PeproTech) for coating, and biotinylated rabbit anti human CCL2 antibodies (#500-P34Bt; PeproTech) for detection. The ELISA for CXCL8 involved mouse mAbs against human CXCL8 (#511502; BioLegend) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human CXCL8 (#500-P28; PeproTech) for coating, and biotinylated goat anti human CXCL8 antibodies (#BAF208; R&D Systems) or biotinylated rabbit anti human CXCL8 antibodies (#500-P28Bt; PeproTech) for detection. The ELISA for CCL5 involved mouse mAbs against human CCL5 (#500-M75; PeproTech) for coating, and biotinylated goat anti human CCL5 antibodies (#BAF278; R&D Systems) for detection. The ELISA for TNF-\u03b1 involved mouse mAbs against human TNF-\u03b1 (#500-M26; PeproTech) for coating, and biotinylated rabbit anti human TNF-\u03b1 antibodies (#500-P31ABt; PeproTech) for detection. Following the addition of streptavidin\u2013horseradish peroxidase, the substrate TMB/E (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) was added. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4, and was measured at 450 nm.ImmunohistochemistryThe expression of CCL2 by CAFs in biopsies of patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was determined as described previously. Briefly, serial sections (5 \u03bcm thick) obtained from archived paraffin blocks of patients were processed and stained by antibodies against human CCL2. Staining was evaluated by a breast-cancer specialized pathologist.Western blottingTo determine the activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1 stimulation was carried out at time points that were determined by preliminary kinetics analyses (based on published literature and on our experience in other cell systems; data not shown). In all of the experiments described below, control cells were incubated with the relevant vehicles of the reagents. The following primary antibodies were used: phosphorylated p65 (#3033; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), total p65 (#4764; Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated c-Jun (#1527-s; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA), total c-Jun (#610326; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA) and I\u03baB\u03b1 (#4814; Cell Signaling Technology). To determine the characteristics of patient CAFs and of Tumor CM-derived CAFs, the following primary antibodies were used: pan-cytokeratin (#MA5-13203; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), \u03b1SMA (#A-2547; Sigma-Aldrich and #ab5694; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), vimentin (#sc-6260; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FSP1 (#ab12480; Abcam) and FAP\u03b1 (#sc-135069; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Loading controls were determined using antibodies against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; #ab9485; Abcam), \u03b2-tubulin (#ab6046; Abcam) and Erk (#sc-154; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as indicated in the figures. After washing, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies. In all cases, conventional western blot procedures were taken and membranes were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) solution and X-ray film.Migration of monocytic cellsMonocytic THP-1 cells were grown in suspension in enriched RPMI medium and their migration in response to CM of MSCs, stimulated or not stimulated by TNF-\u03b1, was determined. To this end, MSCs were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 24 hours, while control cells were exposed to the vehicle of the cytokine (0.1% BSA) in DMEM starvation medium. Supernatants from control and from stimulated cells were then collected and divided into groups as follows: supernatants from untreated control MSCs; supernatants from TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs, treated by neutralizing antibodies against CCL2 (2 \u03bcg/ml, #MAB679; R&D Systems); and supernatants from TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs, treated by isotype-matched nonrelevant antibody (2 \u03bcg/ml, #401201; BioLegend). Recombinant human CCL2 (rhCCL2) was used at 100 ng/ml as positive control in the migration assays. rhCCL2 was either untreated or treated by neutralizing antibodies against CCL2 (as above). All antibody treatments were performed for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The migration of human THP-1 monocytic cells in response to these cell supernatants was assessed by a 48-well modified Boyden chamber through a polycarbonate polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filter (8 \u03bcm pore size; Osmonics, Livermore, CA, USA). After 2 hours, the filters were fixed by methanol, and stained with a Diff-Quik kit (Dade Behring, Dudingen, Switzerland). The cells were counted in five high-power fields (HPF) by light microscopy in triplicate.Statistical analysesImpact of prolonged stimulation by Tumor CM on the release of inflammatory chemokines by the resulting CAFs. Human BM-derived MSCs were cultured with Tumor CM from MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA) (A) or MCF-7 cells (B) over a prolonged period of time (~30 days; MSCs + MDA CM or MSCs + MCF-7 CM, respectively). Twenty-four hours after medium exchange to fresh Tumor CM, cell supernatants were collected and the expression of CCL2 (A1, B1), CXCL8 (A2, B2) and CCL5 (A3, B3) was determined in comparison with supernatants of MSCs that were not supplemented with CM (MSCs) and with the original Tumor CM of MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells alone (MDA CM or MCF-7 CM, respectively). Chemokine expression was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. (A1), (A2), (B1) Representatives of n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results. (A3), (B2), (B3) Ratios between MSCs and MSCs + Tumor CM were not consistent in different experimental repeats. Therefore, in these panels, the findings are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of normalized values (MSCs were given the value of 1) obtained in relevant experimental repeats (at least n = 3).Student\u2019s t test was used to calculate P values for ELISAs and chemotaxis assays. P <0.05 was considered significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure. Using this procedure, all of the significant results that were presented in the manuscript remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity. The ELISA results presented in the paper show a representative experiment out of n \u2265 3 independent experiments that have shown similar trends. An exception is shown in Figure\u00a01A3,B2,B3, where the effect of Tumor CM on chemokine release was not consistent; therefore, in these cases, the results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the different experiments (MSCs were given the value of 1). The confocal pictures are representatives of many pictures that were taken in at least three independent experiments.Results and discussionThe effects of long-term stimulation of MSCs by Tumor CM on the inflammatory nature of the resulting CAFsPublished reports indicate that prolonged stimulation of BM-derived human MSCs with breast tumor-derived factors (Tumor CM) has led to conversion of MSCs into functional CAFs that promoted tumor growth. We began this study by determining the influence of such tumor-derived factors on the inflammatory traits of CAFs generated by MSCs exposed to Tumor CM, using the expression of the inflammatory/pro-malignancy chemokines CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 as readouts. To this end, we followed our published procedure on generation of CAFs that are functional in vivo in promoting breast cancer, by stimulating MSCs with Tumor CM for ~30 days. Following such stimulation with Tumor CM of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast tumor cells, the resulting cells have undergone conversion to CAF-like cells (to be termed herein CAFs), as expected (Figure S2 in Additional file 1).The generation of such CAFs by Tumor CM has been only partly accompanied by enhanced inflammatory profile of the resulting CAFs. Tumor CM of MDA-MB-231 cells has increased the release of CCL2 and CXCL8 but not of CCL5 (Figure\u00a01A), while Tumor CM of MCF-7 cells did not promote the release of CXCL8 and CCL5 by the Tumor CM-generated CAFs (Figure\u00a01B2,B3) and downregulated the expression of CCL2 by the cells (Figure\u00a01B1). These results indicate that when CAFs are generated by exposure to breast tumor-derived factors, the process leads to only marginal increases in the inflammatory phenotype of the resulting CAFs. Moreover, only the CM of the more aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells upregulated chemokine production by the resulting CAFs, revealing heterogeneity in the content of the factors produced by different breast tumor cells and in their impact on the expression of inflammatory traits by CAFs. The content of Tumor CM is complex (for example); thus, the identity of the factors regulating the expression of the different chemokines is yet to be explored and the question of whether these same factors also induce the conversion of MSCs to CAFs needs to be addressed in future studies.TNF-\u03b1 prominently induces the release of pro-cancerous chemokines by Tumor CM-generated CAFs and by patient CAFsTNF-\u03b1 induces potent elevation in inflammatory traits in MSCs and Tumor-CM-generated CAFs. Human BM-derived MSCs were cultured with Tumor CM from MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA) (A) or from MCF-7 cells (B) over a prolonged period of time (~30 days). TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) or its vehicle (in control cells) was added for the last 24 hours. Expression of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 was then determined in supernatants of the cells. (A) Expression of the chemokines in the four experimental groups included in the study: MSCs grown in culture for ~30 days without any additional stimulus (MSCs); MSCs grown in culture for ~30 days in the presence of Tumor CM derived from MDA-MB-231 cells (MSCs + MDA CM); MSCs grown in culture for ~30 days and stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 at the last 24 hours of culture (MSCs + TNF-\u03b1); and MSCs grown in culture for ~30 days in the presence of Tumor CM derived from MDA-MB-231 cells and stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 at the last 24 hours of culture (MSCs + MDA CM + TNF-\u03b1). Expression of CCL2 (A1), CXCL8 (A2) and CCL5 (A3) was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. (B) Experimental design as in (A), but with MCF-7-derived CM. In each panel, the findings are representatives of at least n = 3 experiments that have shown similar results. In comparisons between MSCs and all other groups: *P <0.05, **P \u22640.01, ***P \u22640.001. NS, not significant. #Differences between the two indicated groups have shown variability in n \u2265 3 independent experiments and overall were not significant.TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are highly expressed by cancer cells of patients in human breast tumors (and also by adjacent stromal cells and leukocytes). Of the two cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 is of particular interest because of its divergent and at times opposing roles in the TME, and also because it induces the release of inflammatory chemokines by breast tumor cells and normal tissue cells (for example). Also, as we show in Figure S3 in Additional file 1, the expression of TNF-RI and TNF-RII was denoted in MSCs. Thus, we questioned what is the impact of TNF-\u03b1 on the inflammatory traits of CAFs derived from MSCs stimulated by Tumor CM. Breast tumor cells are known to lose in culture the capacity to release endogenous inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (lack of endogenous TNF-\u03b1 expression is shown in Figure S4 in Additional file 1, under nontransfected and control vector cells; results for IL-1\u03b2 are not shown). Therefore, we have used exogenous TNF-\u03b1 for stimulating the CAFs that were generated from MSCs by Tumor CM. We then determined the release of the inflammatory chemokines by the stimulated cells (Figure\u00a02).To determine the effects of TNF-\u03b1 stimulation on Tumor CM-generated CAFs, MSCs that were exposed to Tumor CM for ~30 days were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 during the last 24 hours of culture (MSCs + MDA CM + TNF-\u03b1 or MSCs + MCF-7 CM + TNF-\u03b1) followed by determination of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 expression in cell supernatants. In parallel, chemokine expression was determined in MSCs that were exposed to Tumor CM alone for the same prolonged time period (MSCs + MDA CM or MSCs + MCF-7 CM) and in MSCs that were grown in culture for ~30 days without Tumor CM and were then stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 during the last 24 hours (MSCs + TNF-\u03b1). The results shown in Figure\u00a02 demonstrate that when CAFs were generated by prolonged exposure of MSCs to Tumor CM, the resulting CAFs responded to TNF-\u03b1 by elevated release of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5. In parallel, stimulation of MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 has also induced the release of the three chemokines (Figure\u00a02). However, there were no significant differences in chemokine levels induced by stimulation of Tumor CM-generated CAFs with TNF-\u03b1 when compared with stimulation of MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 (two right-hand bars in Figure\u00a02). These results indicate that Tumor CM did not cooperate with TNF-\u03b1 in upregulating chemokine release and did not have much of an added value. TNF-\u03b1 thus had a dominant role in inducing the inflammatory traits in Tumor CM-generated CAFs and in MSCs. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 induced the release of the inflammatory chemokines even when the Tumor CM alone (as shown in Figure\u00a01 for CCL5 stimulation by MDA CM and for CXCL8 and CCL5 stimulation by MCF-7 CM) had no effect. These results indicate that the different chemokines are commonly regulated by TNF\u03b1, unlike their differential response to breast Tumor CM.These findings suggest that, following their recruitment to the tumor site, MSCs are exposed to tumor constituents that promote their differentiation to CAFs and to some extent can also elevate their ability to release pro-malignancy chemokines. However, since the TME is enriched with TNF-\u03b1 released by the tumor cells, this inflammatory cytokine turns into a most powerful inducer of chemokine release by CAFs. TNF-\u03b1 thus enriches the TME with high levels of inflammatory/tumor-promoting chemokines presenting many deleterious pro-cancerous effects.Basal and cytokine-induced release of inflammatory chemokines by patient CAFs. CAFs were isolated from lung metastasis of a breast cancer patient (CAFs #1) or from a primary tumor of a different breast cancer patient (CAFs #2). (A1, B1) Expression of the pro-malignancy chemokines CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. (A2, B2) Expression of CCL5 was determined following TNFa and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation (TNF-\u03b1, 50 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2, 500 pg/ml; 48 hours). Control cells were stimulated by vehicle. Expression of the chemokines was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. In all panels, the findings are representatives of at least n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.To examine the potential clinical relevance of these observations we tested the content of inflammatory chemokines in CAFs obtained directly from a lung metastasis of a breast cancer patient (CAFs #1) and from a different patient\u2019s primary breast tumor (CAFs #2). Two such CAF isolates showed production of CCL2 and of CXCL8 (Figure\u00a03A1 and 3B1, respectively). Both patient CAF isolates did not secrete CCL5 (Figure\u00a03A1,B1).To better understand the regulation of chemokine release by patient CAFs, we asked whether CCL5 \u2013 which was not released constitutively by these cells \u2013 would be upregulated by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 that are known to prevail at the TME of breast tumors. Indeed, in line with the expression of both TNF-RI and TNF-RII by the two patient CAF isolates (Figure S3 in Additional file 1), both isolates responded to TNF-\u03b1 with increased release of CCL5 (Figure\u00a03A2,B2). Similar upregulation of CCL5 expression was observed after stimulation by IL-1\u03b2 (Figure\u00a03A2,B2), suggesting that chemokine induction by inflammatory cytokines may be a general effect and not necessarily limited to TNF-\u03b1. These findings support the clinical relevance of our previous findings, showing that TNF-\u03b1 upregulated CCL5 in CAFs generated from MSCs by MDA Tumor CM (Figure\u00a02A3) and by MCF-7 Tumor CM (Figure\u00a02B3), and suggest that they reflect the clinical conditions of breast cancer.Overall, the results obtained in this part of the study indicate that while tumor constituents had marginal effects on the inflammatory traits of Tumor CM-generated CAFs, the effects of the inflammatory microenvironment \u2013 represented here by TNF-\u03b1 \u2013 were more prominent and may lead to pronounced upregulation of inflammatory chemokines in the TME. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 highly prevail in breast tumors, and thus the inflammatory phenotype gained by patient CAFs in response to such inflammatory cytokines may form the basis of inflammation\u2013stroma associations that promote breast cancer progression in patient tumors.TNF-\u03b1 amplifies the inflammatory phenotype of MSCs by activating TNF-RI and TNF-RIITNF-\u03b1 upregulates the inflammatory profile of MSCs via receptors TNF-RI and TNF-RII. (A) Relative induction of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 in MSCs by TNF-\u03b1. Human BM-derived MSCs were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 24 hours and the expression of the inflammatory chemokines CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 in supernatants of MSCs was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. Results are from an experiment in which all three chemokines were analyzed in parallel, and the ratios between the three chemokines are representatives of the values obtained in many experimental repeats. (B) Human BM-derived MSCs were exposed to neutralizing antibodies against tumor necrosis factor receptors TNF-RI and TNF-RII or nonrelevant isotype-matched control antibodies (Control Ab) 1 hour prior to stimulation with TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml), and in the course of 24 hours of stimulation by the cytokine. Control, cells stimulated with vehicle. Expression of CCL2 was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. The findings are representatives of at least n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.MSCs that populate tumors are candidates for activation by inflammatory factors that are present at the TME. The findings shown in Figure\u00a04A indicate that, following stimulation by TNF-\u03b1, CXCL8 was the chemokine most prominently induced in MSCs, followed by CCL2 and then CCL5, which underwent relatively low levels of induction. Moreover, the elevations in CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 production obtained in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs were recapitulated by CM of MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells that were transfected to express TNF-\u03b1 (Figure S5 in Additional file 1). Specifically, TNF-\u03b1 expression by the tumor cells led to prominent upregulation of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 production by MSCs (Figure S5 in Additional file 1). The inflammatory impact was not limited to TNF-\u03b1 but was also detected following stimulation of MSCs by exogenous IL-1\u03b2 (Figure S6 in Additional file 1). Overall, all three chemokines \u2013 CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 \u2013 were induced in MSCs by the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, suggesting that they all may be upregulated in the TME by inflammatory mediators that are highly prevalent at breast tumor sites.CCL2 is expressed by CAFs localized in vicinity to breast cancer cells in tumors of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients. CCL2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in biopsy sections of patients diagnosed with IDC: (A) IDC #1, (B) IDC #2. CCL2 staining was detected in cancer cells and in adjacent fibroblasts. Some of the CCL2-expressing CAFs are indicated by arrows.Of the three chemokines induced in MSCs by TNF-\u03b1, CCL2 was of most interest to us. This chemokine is highly versatile and promotes the inflammatory and pro-cancerous nature of the TME by acting at many divergent levels, not all shared by CXCL8 and CCL5. Furthermore, CCL2 has very high relevance to our current study because we discovered that it was expressed by CAFs residing in proximity to human cancer cells in biopsies of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients (Figure\u00a05). To further understand the molecular mechanisms mediating inflammation\u2013stroma interactions, we focused on the mechanisms mediating the process of TNF-\u03b1-induced CCL2 secretion by MSCs. Using neutralizing antibodies to TNF-RI and to TNF-RII, the secretion of CCL2 was significantly inhibited compared with isotype-treated controls (Figure\u00a04B; inhibition of TNF-RI gave rise to 36 to 55% reduction in CCL2 secretion and inhibition of TNF-RII to 34 to 54% reduction), indicating that both receptors mediate the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on CCL2 release by MSCs (based on analyses combining the two antibodies at different concentrations (data not shown), we believe that the inhibition levels could not reach higher levels due to insufficient neutralizing activities of the antibodies). These findings are of major interest because TNF-RI is abundant in most cell types, while the expression of TNF-RII is not as promiscuous but nevertheless was found to be upregulated in breast cancer.Induction of inflammatory traits in MSCs by TNF-\u03b1 is tightly regulated by the NF-\u03baB pathwayInduction of CCL2 and CLXL8 in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MSCs is not mediated via the AP-1 pathway. (A) Human BM-derived MSCs were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 5 and 10 minutes. Control cells were treated by the vehicle of TNF-\u03b1. c-Jun levels and phosphorylation were determined by western blot (WB) analyses. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as loading control. (B) Human BM-derived MSCs were transiently transfected by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to c-Jun or by control siRNA. (B1) c-Jun expression was determined by WB analyses. \u03b2-Tubulin was used as loading control. (B2) Following siRNA transfection, the cells were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (25 ng/ml; in this part of the study we used a suboptimal concentration of TNF-\u03b1 in order to facilitate detection of inhibitory effects) for 24 hours. Expression levels of CCL2 and CXCL8 in the supernatants of the cells were determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. #siRNA to c-Jun has yielded minor increases or reductions in CCL2 and CXCL8 secretion in different experiments (see Results and discussion), and thus overall there was no significant effect on CCL2 and CXCL8 secretion. In all panels, the findings are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.The AP-1 and NF-\u03baB transcription factors are known to induce the expression of inflammatory chemokines in the immune context; however, their extent of involvement in inducing such chemokines depends on the cell type and stimulus. From the therapeutic perspective it is crucial to know whether both or only one of these transcription factors are mediating the response of MSCs to inflammatory stimuli that give rise to increased production of pro-malignancy chemokines. We began this part of the study by determining the involvement of AP-1 in induction of CCL2 and CXCL8, the two inflammatory chemokines that we found to be most relevant to the clinical setting, as shown by their expression by patient CAF isolates #1 and #2 (Figure\u00a03). While AP-1 was activated by TNF-\u03b1 stimulation of MSCs, it did not play a role in inducing CCL2 and CXCL8 (Figure\u00a06). Specifically, in response to TNF-\u03b1, c-Jun \u2013 the active component of AP-1 \u2013 was rapidly induced in MSCs (possibly due to elevated stability), as was the phosphorylated form of c-Jun (Figure\u00a06A). However, downregulation of c-Jun expression by siRNA (Figure\u00a06B1) did not lead to reduction in CCL2 and CXCL8 expression following TNF-\u03b1 stimulation (Figure\u00a06B2; impact on CCL2 was in the range of 21% inhibition to 33% increase and for CXCL8 was in the range of 29% inhibition to 27% increase).NF-\u03baB is essential in mediating TNF-\u03b1-induced release of chemokines by MSCs. (A) Human BM-derived MSCs were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 15 minutes. The levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 (the negative regulator of the NF-\u03baB pathway) were determined by WB analyses. GAPDH was used as a loading control throughout. (B) CAFs were generated by culturing MSCs with Tumor CM from MDA-MB-231 (MDA) or MCF-7 breast tumor cells over a prolonged period of time (~30 days). TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) was added for the last 24 hours to MSCs + Tumor CM cells and I\u03baB\u03b1 levels were determined by WB analyses. (C) CAF #1 cells were stimulated for 48 hours by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml). I\u03baB\u03b1 levels were determined by WB analyses. (D) Human BM-derived MSCs were stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) for 10 minutes. p65 phosphorylation was determined by WB analyses. (E) Human BM-derived MSCs were transiently transfected by siRNA to p65 or by control siRNA. (E1) p65 expression was determined by WB analyses. (E2) Following siRNA transfection, the cells were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (25 ng/ml; a suboptimal concentration of TNF-\u03b1 in order to facilitate detection of inhibitory effects) for 48 hours. Expression of CCL2 and CXCL8 in the supernatants of the cells was determined by ELISA, in the linear range of absorbance. In all panels, the findings are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.Different results were obtained for NF-\u03baB, showing that this transcription factor is cardinal in CCL2 and CXCL8 upregulation by TNF-\u03b1 in MSCs. First, we found that TNF-\u03b1 stimulation induced significant reduction in the expression levels of I\u03baB\u03b1, the negative regulator of the NF-\u03baB pathway, in MSCs (Figure\u00a07A). Similar results were obtained in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated Tumor CM-derived CAFs, as well as in patient CAFs (Figure\u00a07B,C). In parallel, p65 was activated by TNF-\u03b1 stimulation of MSCs (Figure\u00a07D) and direct roles for NF-\u03baB in CCL2 and CXCL8 induction were revealed when p65 was downregulated by siRNA to p65 (Figure\u00a07E1). Specifically, p65 knockdown by siRNA resulted in almost complete inhibition of CCL2 (78 to 88%) and CXCL8 (82 to 90%) release by TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs (Figure\u00a07E2).In contrast to the results obtained with TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, a different pattern was obtained with regards to the impact of Tumor CM on the cells: while factors released by tumor cells resulted in MSC conversion to CAFs (Figure S2 in Additional file 1) and to elevated release of some of the inflammatory chemokines (Figure\u00a01), no activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway was observed in MSCs exposed to Tumor CM (Figure\u00a07B). Here, we need to take into account the fact that the cells were exposed to Tumor CM for 1 month and thus it is possible that the rapid NF-\u03baB activation signals could no longer be detected.To summarize, the results of this part of the study clearly indicate an NF-\u03baB-based pathway that regulates the expression of inflammatory and pro-malignancy chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL8 in MSCs and in CAFs in response to TNF-\u03b1. NF-\u03baB, but not AP-1, was involved in TNF-\u03b1-induced inflammatory patterns of CAFs and MSCs, despite the fact that the promoter domains of both these chemokines contain binding sites for c-Jun. This dichotomy between the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors in controlling CCL2 and CXCL8 production in MSCs indicates that the inflammatory profile of MSCs is tightly regulated. The preference of one transcription factor over another needs to be considered when potential therapeutic measures are directed to intracellular components involved in inflammation-induced tumor progression, such as NF-\u03baB and AP-1.The inflammatory traits gained by MSCs following stimulation by TNF-\u03b1 lead to potential pro-cancerous effectsThus far, we have demonstrated that the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced inflammatory traits in CAFs and MSCs; furthermore, we have delineated the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes. To follow on these observations, we asked whether the inflammatory traits induced by TNF-\u03b1 in MSCs have functional relevance to tumor-promoting events taking place at the TME.MSCs promote monocyte migration through TNF-\u03b1-induced secretion of CCL2. Supernatants (sups) were collected from human BM-derived MSCs that were stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 (50 ng/ml) or by its vehicle for 24 hours. Thereafter, the sups were incubated with neutralizing antibodies for CCL2 or with nonrelevant isotype-matched control antibody (I.C.) for 30 minutes. The migration of monocytic cells in response to control medium (without chemokine), to recombinant human CCL2 (rhCCL2; 100 ng/ml) or to sups from TNF-\u03b1-stimulated or TNF-\u03b1 nonstimulated MSCs was determined by Boyden chamber migration assays. Cells were counted under a high-power field (HPF). The findings are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments that have shown similar results.CCL2 induces the recruitment to tumors of myeloid subpopulations that exert prominent pro-cancerous effects, including TAMs and MDSCs. We examined the in vitro migration of monocytic cells and found that it was induced by supernatants of TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs (Figure\u00a08), which have been previously found to be enriched with CCL2 (Figures\u00a02 and 4A). Furthermore, this migratory response was absolutely dependent on CCL2 because neutralization of this chemokine abolished the increase in monocytic cell migration in response to supernatants derived from TNF-\u03b1-stimulated MSCs (Figure\u00a08). These results suggest that TNF-\u03b1, which is prevalent in the TME, acts on MSCs that reside in the tumors, leading to high production of CCL2 by these cells. This chemokine, in turn, may induce the recruitment of deleterious myeloid infiltrates to the tumor and thus further promote the malignant phenotype of the tumor. Chemokine pro-cancerous activities may thus not only be initiated by the tumor cells directly, but may also be induced by inflammatory factors of the TME acting on stromal cells residing in proximity to the cancer cells.Furthermore, our findings suggesting that MSC-derived CCL2 promotes the recruitment of TAMs and MDSCs to breast tumors emphasize the important roles of inflammation\u2013stroma interactions. These findings gain high relevance with the fact that CCL2 is indeed expressed in breast cancer cells, as we have shown in our study of biopsies of invasive ductal carcinoma patients (Figure\u00a05).ConclusionsMuch prominence has been given to inflammation-driven activities that promote tumor progression by acting on cancer cells, infiltrating leukocytes and adjacent stromal cells. In the current study we provide new findings on the networks that control the inflammatory phenotype of CAFs and MSCs, demonstrating key roles for the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in upregulating the release of inflammatory, tumor-promoting chemokines by these two cell types.TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are highly relevant to the inflammatory setup of breast tumors. They are minimally expressed by normal breast epithelial cells while their expression by breast tumor cells was detected in ~85% of breast tumors in patients; elevated incidence of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression was highly correlated with relapsed and advanced disease. In the current study we found that TNF-\u03b1 upregulated the inflammatory phenotype of Tumor CM-derived CAFs and patient-derived CAFs, manifested by the increased release of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5 which are inflammatory chemokines having strong tumor-promoting activities in general and in breast cancer, particularly when derived from stroma cells. TNF-\u03b1 was also demonstrated to be a key inducer of inflammatory characteristics in MSCs, with activities that were much more pronounced and general than those induced by tumor constituents (Tumor CM). As a result of TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, the stromal cells acquired the ability to release high levels of CCL2, CXCL8 and CCL5. The increased release of these chemokines from CAFs and MSCs may lead to exacerbated inflammatory and pro-cancerous nature of the TME and, based on our results (Figure\u00a08), may lead to increased levels of deleterious myeloid infiltrates in breast tumors. The findings of our study thus suggest that stromal cells located near the cancer cells have a major role in promoting the inflammatory nature of the TME. Overall, a coordinated inflammatory network may be established at the tumor site between the cancer cells and stromal cells, set up by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.In this study we have also revealed the important role of NF-\u03baB, but not of AP-1, in mediating the activities of TNF-\u03b1 on MSCs and CAFs. These findings support other reports, indicating that the NF-\u03baB pathway is a key cellular component that controls inflammatory events at the TME. The ultimate need for NF-\u03baB activation in this process provides novel insights into specificity in regulatory pathways and may thus have clinical therapeutic implications. This need shows that NF-\u03baB may be a preferred target for inhibition and that its roles are not limited to the tumor cells themselves and to infiltrating leukocytes, but rather extend to stromal cells at the tumor milieu. Thus, our study strongly supports the positioning of NF-\u03baB as a master regulator that may serve as a therapeutic target, whose inhibition may lead to significant downregulation of inflammatory, pro-cancerous events in the entire tumor.Currently, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB in cancer has not entered the stage of clinical trials, and may be hampered by the fact that this pathway regulates a number of essential cellular processes and immune activities. Such hurdles can be overcome by directing the NF-\u03baB-inhibiting modalities to specific target cells, in which this transcription factor is the key inducer of undesired inflammatory, tumor-promoting effects. In this respect, the results of our study imply that MSCs and CAFs could serve as appropriate targets for NF-\u03baB inhibition, through which downregulation of the inflammatory TME could be achieved.Additional fileAbbreviations\u03b1SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinBMbone marrowBSAbovine serum albuminCAFcancer-associated fibroblastCMconditioned mediumDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFAP\u03b1fibroblast activation protein alphaFBSfetal bovine serumFSP1fibroblast specific protein 1GAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHPFhigh power fieldILinterleukinIDCinvasive ductal carcinomamAbmonoclonal antibodyMDSCmyeloid-derived suppressor cellMSCmesenchymal stem/stromal cellNFnuclear factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNATAMtumor-associated macrophageTMEtumor microenvironmentTNF-\u03b1tumor necrosis factor alphaTNF-Rtumor necrosis factor receptorWBwestern blotChristina Katanov, Shalom Lerrer, Debabrata Banerjee and Adit Ben-Baruch contributed equally to this work.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors\u2019 contributionsCK and SL were the major contributors to the acquisition of data and performed most of the experiments included in the study.

        "title": "Heterogeneity of the motility responses in malignant tumor cells: a biological basis for the diversity and homing of metastatic cells.",
        "content": "Tumor metastasis requires highly motile cells that can respond to appropriate stimuli. A2058 human melanoma cells were shown previously to secrete a highly potent autocrine motility factor (AMF) that stimulates chemokinetic movement. We have shown that the insulin polypeptides (IPs; insulin-like growth factors I and II [IGF-I, -II] and insulin) stimulated A2058 cell chemotaxis and chemokinesis. We now report that the IPs and AMF stimulate locomotion in other human malignant cell lines. Insulin (100 nM) induced motility of up to 50% of the magnitude of the AMF response in human carcinoma lines MDA-231 (breast), T24 (bladder), and OVCAR3 (ovarian). The tumorigenic and metastatic 5R Haras-transfected rat embryo fibroblast cell line responded to insulin with both chemotaxis and chemokinesis and was 100% of that seen for AMF. The ED50 for IGF-I in the carcinoma cell lines was in the order of I nM, but the magnitude of the responses at this concentration was 40% of the AMF-stimulated response, with the exception of the A2058 cells, which were maximally stimulated at I nM. IGF-II induced maximal motility of 75 to 130% of the AMF-stimulated response in the carcinoma lines with ED50 of less than or equal to 10 nM. IGF-II-stimulated motility in the carcinoma lines was predominantly chemotactic by modified checkerboard analysis. Cell pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited 90-100% of AMF-induced motility, whereas migration to the IPs was not pertussis toxinsusceptible. In growth studies, IGF-I induced mitogenesis up to 140% of basal media control growth. In general, maximal growth stimulation was seen at 100 nM IGF-I, and optimal migration was seen at 10 nM IGF-I. The IGFs are secreted by normal stroma in a number of organs that are common sites for primary and metastatic disease. Therefore, we suggest that IPs may be important homing and mitogenic signals for tumor cells in the process of invasion and metastasis and that the differential motility stimulation and respective mechanisms of action by these physiologically important agents may underlie the diversity of the metastatic process.",

        "full_text": "Rapid intraoperative insulin assay: a novel method to differentiate insulinoma from nesidioblastosis in the pediatric patientIntroductionHyperinsulinism is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. Causes can include nesidioblastosis, pancreatic islet cell tumors such as insulinoma, and associations with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Although new, improved imaging techniques have allowed for more precise preoperative localization of insulinomas, the differentiation of nesidioblastosis and insulinoma, particularly in children, can be challenging. To improve intraoperative localization and confirmation of successful resection of insulinoma, a novel hormonal assay, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay, is reported for the first time in a pediatric patient. This intraoperative radioimmunoassay for insulin yields results within several minutes and confirms complete resection of insulinoma.Case descriptionWe present a case of pancreatic insulinoma in a child with symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, causing seizures. The insulinoma was enucleated laparoscopically, and rapid intra-operative insulin assay used to determine the success of the procedure.Discussion and evaluationThis rapid intra-operative test provides a valuable adjunct for determining complete excision in complicated cases of recurrent or questionable insulinoma. Although not a common problem, for pediatric patients in whom the diagnosis is not clear, this test may provide a novel approach to confirming disease.ConclusionWe propose the use of this assay in facilitating intra-operative resection and confirmation of complete excision in pediatric patients. This population may especially benefit from this novel assay to confirm complete resection and to differentiate multiple etiologies of hyperinsulinism.BackgroundHyperinsulinism is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. Causes can include nesidioblastosis, pancreatic islet cell tumors such as insulinoma, and associations with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Pancreatic islet cell tumors have an annual incidence of 1 in 1,000,000, with insulinoma being the most common type, accounting for 70% to 80% of all pancreatic endocrine tumors. Peak incidence is in the third and fifth decades of life, but it can occur in all age groups. These tumors are usually solitary, benign, and diagnosed while still small because of clinical presentation of uncontrollable hypoglycemia. Insulinoma is equally distributed throughout the whole pancreatic gland. Preoperative localization is sometimes challenging, with up to 64% not localized at laparotomy. New improved imaging techniques have allowed for more precise preoperative localization. Noninvasive imaging modalities include transabdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While transabdominal US shows 30% sensitivity in detecting a tumor, conventional CT provides 73% sensitivity. Invasive imaging procedures such as angiography and transhepatic venous hormone sampling are more accurate in detecting tumor, but they are more expensive and depend on the experience of the person performing the study. Sensitivity with angiography is 35% to 65%, and 77% to 100% with transhepatic portal venous sampling. Selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling is another invasive method, with a sensitivity of nearly 100%. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the procedure of choice for tumor localization. With 2\u20133-mm resolution, EUS can be used with radial (diagnostic) or linear (for fine needle aspiration) echoendoscope and allows continuous imaging technique. Accuracy of EUS is 88% and, in combination with biphasic helical CT, increases to 97%. Intraoperative EUS can successfully localize tumors in 90% of cases and can determine tumor size and invasion into the duodenum as well as vascular invasion (portal vein, small mesenteric artery, splenic vein) metastasis into the regional lymph nodes. It may distinguish nonmalignant lesions from pancreatic carcinomas.Even with these diagnostic studies, localization of insulinoma can be difficult, and, especially in the child, must be differentiated from nesidioblastosis. This clinical and pathologic disease involves hyperplasia of the beta cells of the pancreas, which leads to persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) and can present in adults with organic hyperinsulinism. In infants, the annual incidence is 1 in 50,000 births for the sporadic form, but may be up to 1 in 2,500 births in certain regions. Treatment varies significantly, depending on symptoms, from medical management with diazoxide and chlorothiazide, nifedipine, glucagon, and octreotide to some who require partial or subtotal pancreatectomy. Surgery, however, results in high rates of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, with long-term complications of diabetes mellitus or malnutrition.To improve intraoperative localization and confirmation of successful resection, a novel hormonal assay, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay, has been developed. This intraoperative radioimmunoassay for insulin yields results within several minutes and confirms complete resection of insulinoma. It determines the level of active insulin molecule in the serum and is checked before insulinoma enucleation and right after enucleation intraoperatively. Although there is little guidance as to precise criteria for gauging success, one proposed protocol is similar to that used for quick parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay (i.e., a 50% drop). When insulin levels drop more than 50% of baseline within several minutes of insulinoma resection, the surgery is considered successful.Here we present a case of pancreatic insulinoma in a child with symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, causing seizures. The insulinoma was enucleated laparoscopically \u2013 a well-accepted technique for appropriately selected lesions. Intraoperative insulin measurements confirmed complete tumor resection. We aim to demonstrate that for the pediatric patient, in particular, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay has many advantages for the surgeon in confirming successful resection of insulin-producing tumors.Case presentationThe patient is a 13-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented in December of 2004 with a general tonic-clonic seizure after a basketball game. Blood glucose was 33 mg/dL. Workup was delayed. He had a second seizure in late January 2005 associated with a glucose level less than 40 mg/dL. At that time the C-peptide level was 8.1 U/dL. The patient was admitted for a 72-hour inpatient fast in late March 2005, and had a seizure at hour 18 of the fast. His glucose was 33 mg/dL with an insulin level equal to 21 U/dL, confirming the diagnosis of insulinoma. CT scanning and MRI were performed and demonstrated a 1.8 cm mass in the neck of the pancreas. After several additional seizures he was referred to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital for evaluation and admitted from the office for glucose monitoring and preoperative preparation. The patient underwent intraoperative US followed by laparoscopic enucleation of a pancreatic islet cell tumor.Operative procedureAn arterial line was inserted to allow frequent glucose testing during the operative procedure. The patient's baseline glucose level was 54 mg/dL with a baseline insulin level of 125 U/dL (normal 10\u201386 U/dL). Glucose solution was administered intraoperatively to maintain a blood glucose level greater than 100 mg/dL. After induction of general anesthesia and positioning in the modified lithotomy position, the abdomen was insufflated to 15 mm Hg with CO2. Two 12 mm trocars and three 5 mm trocars were inserted and the lesser sac entered through the omentum, preserving the right gastroepiploic vessels to expose the anterior surface of the pancreas. The inferior aspect of the pancreas was then mobilized to allow inspection of the posterior surface. The splenic vein was clearly identified and dissected. The pancreas was dissected medially and a space posterior to the pancreas and anterior to the portal vein was developed. Laparoscopic US identified a hypoechoic mass in the neck of the pancreas, which was enucleated using a combination of blunt and sharp dissection techniques. The lesion was placed in a retrieval sac and extracted.Intraoperative insulin levels of 172 U/dL were measured after initial identification of the insulinoma. At 5 and 10 minutes postexcision, values dropped to 87 U/dL and 68 U/dL, respectively, demonstrating complete resection. Total operating time was 120 minutes. Postoperatively, the patient's blood glucose increased to 130 mg/dL.The patient developed a pancreatic fistula postoperatively, which was initially controlled via drainage catheter and conservative measures, but ultimately required re-exploration with a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The patient subsequently recovered without complication and final pathology showed a 1.4 \u00d7 1.2 \u00d7 0.9 cm, well-differentiated, intermediate grade insulinoma.Rapid insulin assayTo determine insulin levels intraoperatively, we used the STAT-IntraOperative-System (Future Diagnostics, Arlington, MA). This is a chemiluminescence immunoassay for the quantitative determination of insulin levels in human serum and EDTA plasma. The assay uses two monoclonal antibodies against insulin. Patient samples are introduced into wells and incubated for 7 minutes. The washed wells are then placed into the STAT-Read, which calculates insulin levels by measuring emissions of light in relative light units. The time between obtaining a blood sample and reading a result is under 12 minutes.Discussion and evaluationThis rapid intraoperative test gives us a valuable adjunct for determining complete excision in complicated cases of recurrent or questionable insulinoma. Although not a common problem, for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, this test may provide a novel approach to confirmation. This is especially the case for the pediatric patient. In this report, we highlight the utility of the rapid intraoperative insulin assay as an effective and unique method to confirm curative resection of insulinoma in the pediatric patient, a population where other hyperinsulin-producing conditions, such as nesidioblastosis, must be considered as well. In children, the etiology of hyperinsulinism can be a diagnostic challenge. This assay may represent particular utility intraoperatively to confirm curative resection.Rapid determination of insulin levels with detection of C-peptide is a new modality for diagnosing insulinoma. C-peptide is a 31 amino acid fragment, which is split from the proinsulin molecule to form bioactive insulin in the serum. The analysis is performed by radioimmunoassay and can be done using serum from peripheral blood in a rapid time period. Insulin has a short serum half-life of about 5 minutes; 50% is cleared by the liver and 30% by the kidneys. Several authors have reported the use of intraoperative insulin monitoring during resection of insulinomas in adults, in an attempt to improve intraoperative resection and outcome. Although intraoperative assays for parathyroidectomy are well established and available in many centers \u2013 they are currently the most widely used intraoperative means for hormone measurement in the United States \u2013 the rapid insulin assay is more complicated, is not as widely available, and requires a dedicated team in order to ensure reproducibility and reliability. This assay is a valuable technique that, when performed well, can serve as a useful adjunct to the management and operative resection of patients with known or suspected insulinoma. Our goal is to raise awareness regarding this technique and potential applications that may be useful to the surgeon.Treatment of insulinoma is by surgical resection. However, the surgeon may not know preoperatively if the insulinoma is single or multiple or present in a background of islet cell hyperplasia. To answer these questions, the rapid intraoperative serum insulin assay may be useful. In this case report we have presented a child with an insulinoma for whom intraoperative insulin measurements determined completeness of excision with subsequent cure. Postoperatively, the patient remained normoglycemic and all biochemical parameters returned to normal.ConclusionIn conclusion, we present a confirmatory case demonstrating the utility of the rapid intraoperative insulin assay in facilitating intraoperative resection and confirmation of complete excision of insulinoma for the first time in a pediatric patient. This population may especially benefit from this novel assay to confirm complete resection and to differentiate multiple etiologies of hyperinsulinism in the pediatric population.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsPerformed Surgery: VES, WBIPreparation of Manuscript: VES, AS, WBICritical Review and Corrections: VES, WBIAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in infancy and childhood \u2013 resolving the enigmaLaparoscopic pancreatic surgery for islet cell tumors of the pancreasResults of a prospective strategy to diagnose, localize, and resect insulinomasLocalization of islet cell tumors of the pancreas: a review of current techniquesValue of tumor localization in patients with insulinomaAssessment of selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling to localize insulin-secreting tumoursValue of intra-arterial calcium stimulated venous sampling for regionalization of pancreatic insulinomasEndoscopic ultrasonography for the preoperative localization of insulinomasNoninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome: an update in 10 surgically treated patientsPractical management of hyperinsulinism in infancyNesidioblastosis: an old term and a new understandingLaparoscopic pancreatic resection: single-institution experience of 19 patientsLaparoscopic localization and resection of insulinomasLaparoscopic enucleation of a solitary pancreatic insulinomaIntraoperative insulin measurement during surgical management of insulinomasEvaluation of a new fully automated one-step C-peptide chemiluminescence assay (LIAISON C-Peptid)Evaluation of preoperative and intraoperative arterial stimulation and venous sampling for diagnosis and surgical resection of insulinomaRole of intraoperative insulin monitoring in surgical management of insulinomaRapid insulin assay for intraoperative confirmation of complete resection ofinsulinomas"

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

        "content": "Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to promote tumor growth and progression. Our objective was to measure the effect of TGF-beta1 on fibroblasts isolated from invasive breast cancer patients. Fibroblasts were isolated from tissue obtained at surgery from patients with invasive breast cancer (CAF; n = 28) or normal reduction mammoplasty patients (normal; n = 10). Myofibroblast activation was measured by counting cells immunostained for smooth muscle alpha actin (ACTA2) in cultures +/- TGF-beta 1. Conditioned media (CM) was collected for invasion assays and RNA was isolated from cultures incubated in media +/- TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Q-PCR was used to measure expression of cyclin D1, fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, urokinase, stromelysin-1, and ACTA2 genes. Invasion rate was measured in chambers plated with MDA-MB-231 cells and exposed to CM in the bottom chamber; the number of cells that invaded into the bottom chamber was counted. Wilcox Rank Sum tests were used to evaluate differences in CAFs and normal fibroblasts and the effect of TGF-beta 1. There was no difference in percent myofibroblasts or invasion rate between normal and CAF cultures. However, TGF-beta1 significantly increased the percent of myofibroblasts (P &lt; 0.01) and invasion rate (P = 0.02) in CAF cultures. Stromelysin-1 expression was significantly higher in normal versus CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). TGF-beta 1 significantly increased ACTA2 expression in both normal and CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). Expression of fibronectin and laminin was significantly increased by TGF-beta in CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). CAFs were measurably different from normal fibroblasts in response to TGF-beta 1, suggesting that TGF-beta stimulates changes in CAFs that foster tumor invasion.",

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

Our work suggests a physiological lung and lymph node metastasis suppressor role for RhoA GTPase in breast cancer.IntroductionRho GTPases belong to the Ras GTPase superfamily and in humans consists of about 20 members. Among them, RhoA, Rac1 and CDC42 are the most studied Rho GTPases. These GTPases act as intermediate signal transducers for a diverse array of cell surface receptors such as cytokine receptors, cadherins, integrins, GPCR, and tyrosine kinases, and therefore regulate major cellular events such as cell polarity, cell migration, cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton rearrangements, vesicular trafficking, and gene expression. Aberrant Rho GTPase signaling results in neurological and immunological abnormalities, and malignant cell transformation.Like most other GTPases, RhoA and their activating proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), are commonly believed to be pro-proliferative and act as cancer oncogenes. The evidence for the oncogenic activity of RhoA was first reported using dominant negative and constitutively active RhoA mutants in fibroblasts. While activating RhoA mutants enhanced the transformation activity of a weakly oncogenic RAS mutant, a dominant negative RhoA mutant abrogated the oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation. Later, RhoA was reported to be overexpressed in several epithelial human cancer tissue samples including, breast, testicular, liver, colorectal, ovarian and gastric carcinoma.Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have identified hitherto undiscovered mutations in cancers and identified recurrent loss-of-function and gain-of-dominant-negative function mutations in RhoA in lymphoma, leukemia and several solid tumors. These latest discoveries, therefore, suggested a possible tumor suppressor function for RhoA in cancers. Indeed, studies with mouse models have demonstrated the tumorigenic and metastatic functions of the identified RhoA dominant-negative alleles in colorectal cancer.In addition, analysis of the RNA-seq data generated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project revealed high expression of several RhoGAP genes, which are the upstream negative regulators of RhoA, in basal-like breast cancer tumors raising the possibility that RhoGAPs are oncogenic. The oncogenic role of a RhoGAP named ARHGAP18 in breast cancer was subsequently proven with mouse transplantation model. Importantly, ARHGAP18 was shown to enhance metastasis partly by inactivating RhoA.Although these recent advances in the field support a tumor suppressive role for RhoA, a comprehensive mechanistic analysis on altered RhoA expression in primary tumors and its subsequent effects on tumor microenvironment and metastasis is lacking. In this study, using the highly metastatic 4T1 orthotopic mouse model, which closely resembles the human triple negative breast cancer, we show that downregulation of RhoA expression increases breast cancer lung metastasis. Mechanistically our study suggests that by increasing the expression of chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, decreased RhoA expression increases the proclivity of cancer cells for the sentinel lymph node and enables the cancer cells to have access to the circulation and metastasize.ResultsRhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion in vitroRhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion in vitro.

Although early work suggested a potential oncogenic role for RhoA, numerous recent studies start to challenge this notion. To further investigate the role of RhoA in breast cancer, we stably down-regulated RhoA expression by lentiviral transduction of specific shRNAs (Fig.\u00a01a) and measured the effects of the RhoA knockdown on cancer cells proliferation and invasion. Two different triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (TNBC) were used to ensure the observed effects were not cell type specific. While reduced RhoA expression significantly increased breast cancer cells invasion through Matrigel (Fig.\u00a01b), it did not have a noticeable effect on cell proliferation as measured by two different assays (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). As a positive control for our proliferation assay, we treated breast cancer cells with a selective MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, and observed an expected near-complete suppression on colony formation in clonogenic growth assay (Fig.\u00a01c).We reasoned that if the effect of RhoA knockdown on breast cancer cell invasion is RhoA specific and physiologically relevant, we would expect to observe the opposite effect when RhoA expression or activity is increased. Indeed, stable expression of a constitutively active RhoA variant, RhoAQ63L, in both BT20 and MDA-MB231 considerably decreased their proclivity to invade (Fig.\u00a01d). Together, these results suggested that in breast cancer cells, RhoA suppresses cell invasiveness.RhoA suppresses breast cancer lung metastasis burden in miceRhoA suppresses breast cancer lung metastasis burden in mice.

Metastasis is a complex multimodal activity that involves both host and tumor cells and can only be adequately addressed with an animal model. To investigate the possible role of RhoA in breast cancer metastasis, we exploited the well-established 4T1 syngeneic murine breast cancer model. The 4T1 TNBC cell line was originally derived from a spontaneous mammary tumor in a Balb/c mouse. Hence, it is widely utilized for syngeneic orthotopic mammary tumor allograft experiments. We generated a panel of lentiviral-mediated stable RhoA knockdowns in 4T1 cells with different levels of knockdowns, and used two of them, with a 30% (shRhoA 34) and a 50% (shRhoA 32) knockdown, for subsequent experiments (Fig.\u00a02a). Concurring with human breast cancer cells results, reduced RhoA expression significantly increased 4T1 cells invasion through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a02b). Significantly, similar effects were observed with stable expression of a dominant negative RhoAT19N, but the opposite effect was observed when the constitutively active RhoAQ63L was expressed in 4T1 cells (Fig.\u00a02c). Collectively, these findings strongly suggested that the mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells could be used to investigate the role of RhoA in metastasis.To address this question, we first engineered 4T1 cells to express a GFP-LUC hybrid protein to allow the growth and metastasis of the tumor to be monitored by luciferase bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Upon orthotopic implantation of 4T1 cells, all mice in RhoA knockdown and control groups developed primary tumors. In accord with our in vitro findings where RhoA knockdown did not influence breast cancer cell proliferation, at 30 days post-implantation we did not observe any statistically significant changes in weights or expression levels of proliferation antigen ki67 in RhoA knockdown primary tumors when compared with knockdown control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 in RhoA knockdown primary tumors as well (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). On the contrary, bioluminescent imaging of mice at 29 days post-implantation revealed possible distant metastases in mice implanted with the highest RhoA knockdown (shRhoA 32) 4T1 cells (Fig.\u00a02d) showing a dose-dependent effect of RhoA knockdown on cancer metastasis. Indeed, mice implanted with shRhoA 32 knockdown 4T1 cells exhibited a significantly higher lung metastasis burden compared to other groups during histology analysis (Fig.\u00a02e,f). In a complementary approach, we also down regulated the activity of RhoA in 4T1 cells by stably expressing the dominant negative RhoAT19N allele. Significantly, expression of RhoAT19N had the same effect on lung metastasis as the knockdown of RhoA expression in 4T1 cells and with a minimal effect on tumor weights (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Collectively, these findings suggested that RhoA could act as a physiological suppressor of breast cancer lung metastasis in mice.RhoA suppresses breast cancer sentinel lymph node metastasis in miceIt has been thought that invasive breast cancer cells from the primary tumor gain access to the systemic circulation through intra-tumoral and peripheral blood vasculature. However, with novel and more sensitive research technologies, scientists have identified that for breast cancer, the major systemic metastasis route is through the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Once tumor cells reach the SLN, they can access the systemic circulation directly without first passing down to the next lymph node.RhoA suppresses breast cancer sentinel lymph node metastasis in mice.

N\u2009=\u20093, ns- not significant *P\u2009<\u2009 0.05, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (two-tailed).It is possible that RhoA suppresses the lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells by interfering with the access of the cancer cells to the SLN. To examine this possibility, four weeks after implantation, we harvested the draining/sentinel lymph nodes (right axillary LN) from the cancer cells injected sites and processed them for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. As a control, we also harvested lymph nodes (left inguinal LN) on the contralateral side of the primary tumor. IHC analysis of the SLNs with an epithelial cell specific CK8 antibody revealed that the shRhoA 32 knockdown group mice have higher CK8 staining compared to the control mice, while no statistical significance in CK8 staining in the inguinal lymph nodes was observed between RhoA knockdown and control knockdown mice (Fig.\u00a03a). Similar results were observed with a GFP antibody, which specifically stained the 4T1 cancer cells (Fig.\u00a03b). Collectively, these observations suggested that when the RhoA expression is reduced, invasive 4T1 cells reached the axillary sentinel lymph node more efficiently than the control cells and readily gain access to the systemic circulation for spreading into other organs including the lungs.Metastasis is a complex multiple-step process. In addition to invading the draining lymph node and entering the circulation, the circulating cancer cells must survive the hostile environmental conditions inside the blood vessels until extravasating into a distant tissue for metastatic colonization. To investigate whether RhoA also suppresses the later steps of the metastasis cascade, we tail-vein injected RhoA knockdown or control knockdown 4T1 GFP-LUC cells in Balb/c mice to bypass the early stages of metastasis. Mice were monitored at days 1, 7 and 14 post-injection for lung tumor burden by bioluminescent imaging. As shown in Fig.\u00a03c,d, both the kinetics of lung tumor formation and extent of the tumor burden showed no significant difference between RhoA knockdown and control group mice suggesting that RhoA may not have a role in cancer cell extravasation and colonization.RhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion by modulating the tumor microenvironmentRhoA modulates the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in breast tumors.

It is possible that reduced RhoA expression promotes cancer cell dissemination into sentinel lymph nodes by modulating this dynamic interplay. To investigate this hypothesis, we assessed the major TME components in the control and RhoA knockdown primary tumors harvested from the Balb/c mice 30 days after the orthotopic implantation. TME is mainly composed of activated fibroblasts called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), adaptive and innate immune cells, and vascular endothelial cells. We examined the presence of vascular endothelial cells, CAFs, B-lymphocytes and macrophages in these primary tumors by IHC staining with CD31, \u03b1-SMA, CD19, and F4/80 specific antibodies, respectively. Though no differences were detected in CD31 and CD19 expression between the two groups, a significant elevation was detected in \u03b1-SMA and F4/80 expression in RhoA knockdown tumors compared to control tumors, suggesting an increased infiltration of CAFs and macrophages in RhoA knockdown tumors, respectively (Fig.\u00a04a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03).CAFs are known to drive the tumorigenesis and metastasis phenotype by secreting pro-tumorigenic chemokines, and by enhancing tumor stiffness. While we did not detect any significant differences in collagen content/fibrosis between control and RhoA knockdown tumors as measured by Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, IHC staining with pro-tumorigenic chemokine CXCL12 specific antibody revealed that RhoA knockdown tumors are significantly enriched in CXCL12 expression (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). To identify the source of CXCL12 in the TME, we double-stained the RhoA knockdown tumors with \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 antibodies. We observed that the CXCL12 staining was predominantly co-localized with the staining of \u03b1-SMA suggesting that CXCL12 detected in the TME was mainly secreted by the infiltrated CAFs (Fig.\u00a04c). In agreement with this line of thinking, we failed to detect the expression of CXCL12 in 4T1 cells by qRT-PCR (data not shown). The predominant receptor for CXCL12 is CXCR4. As expected, the expression levels of CXCR4 were also enhanced in RhoA knockdown tumors as measured by IHC staining and qRT-PCR RNA analysis (Fig.\u00a04d,e). Apparently, the enhanced CXCR4 expression is an autonomous effect of the downregulation of RhoA expression in 4T1 cancer cells (Fig.\u00a04e).RhoA modulates the CCR5-CCL5 axis in breast tumors.

N\u2009=\u20094, ns- not significant *P\u2009<\u2009 0.05, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (two-tailed).Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were shown to promote tumor progression, angiogenesis and lung metastasis in several breast cancer in vivo studies, and associated with poor patient survival. During tumor progression, secretion of tumor-derived chemoattractant chemokines leads to the recruitment of circulating monocytes into breast tumors. The infiltrated monocytes will subsequently differentiate into tumor associated-macrophages. It is possible that the increased number of TAMs is a consequence of increased expression of CCL5 in RhoA knockdown tumors. Truly, RhoA knockdown tumors were significantly enriched in CCL5 expression (Fig.\u00a05a). In addition to secreting CXCL12, CAFs have also been shown to be a key source of CCL5 in tumors. Indeed, CAFs but not the cancer cells, are the major contributors of CCL5 in RhoA knockdown tumors as assessed by immunofluorescent staining and qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a05b,c).Paracrine activities of intra-tumoral CCL5 through its cognate receptor CCR5 are reported to promote breast tumor progression, and LN and thoracic metastasis. It is possible that the observed increase in LN and lung metastases in RhoA knockdown mice is caused by activated CCL5-CCR5 signaling in primary tumors. In agreement with this line of reasoning, we observed the expression levels of CCR5 were increased in RhoA knockdown tumors and the increased CCR5 expression levels are partly due to an increase in CCR5 transcripts in cancer cells (Fig.\u00a05d,e).DiscussionIn this study, we investigated the role of RhoA in breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Stable knockdown of RhoA expression had no effect on breast cancer cell proliferation but increased in vitro cell invasion and metastasis. The reported effects of RhoA shRNA-mediated knockdown on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro are mixed. While we and others observed that RhoA has an anti-invasive role, published reports indicating that RhoA has a pro-invasive role in breast cancer exist. At present, the mechanism of how RhoA can have opposite effects on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro is not known. RhoA GTPase has several downstream effectors and some of them reported to have opposing effects on cancer cells invasion. Therefore, it is plausible that, depending on the experimental conditions, knocking down the expression of RhoA can have preferred effects on certain downstream RhoA effectors. However, despite the described opposite effects of RhoA on in vitro breast cancer cells invasion, the effects of specific RhoA shRNA knockdown on breast cancer metastasis has never been formally addressed with an orthotopic transplantation immune-competent mouse model until now. The results of our in vitro invasion assays align rightly with the in vivo mouse experiments strongly suggesting the causal role of RhoA as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor. Among the various effectors, mDia and ROCK are two best-described effectors that are important for RhoA-mediated regulation of cancer cell invasion/metastasis by stabilizing adherens junctions, regulating myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) phosphorylation and focal adhesion dynamics. It remains to be determined if RhoA inhibits breast cancer cell metastasis by targeting adherens junctions, MLC2 phosphorylation, and/or focal adhesions.In addition to cancer cell-autonomous functions, continuous heterotypic communications between cancer cells, ECM, and their surrounding non-malignant cells are also vital for disease progression and metastatic dissemination. Fibroblasts are the most common non-malignant cells in the tumor. In normal tissues, they usually exist in a resting/quiescent state and are activated in response to a plethora of signaling cues. Activated fibroblasts are highly proliferative and metabolically active and identified by their expression of markers like \u03b1-SMA and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). Activated fibroblasts in tumor stroma are termed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally pro-tumorigenic with a dynamic and complex secretory phenotype including ECM molecules (tenascin C, collagen), growth factors (VEGFA, PDGF, HGF), cytokines, and chemokines (TNF, IFN\u03b3, CXCL12, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8). Using the 4T1 triple negative breast cancer mouse model, we observed an inverse correlation between RhoA expression and infiltration of \u03b1-SMA positive CAFs. Consistent with increased infiltrated CAFs, RhoA knockdown tumors were also highly enriched with CAFs-secreted CXCL12. The reduced RhoA activity resulted in increased expression of the cognate receptor, CXCR4, for CXCL12 in 4T1 cancer cells.CAFs-secreted CXCL12 drives tumor progression and metastasis through two possible mechanisms. It mediates the chemotactic recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to promote tumor angiogenesis. It may also enhance the invasive capacity of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells through paracrine stimulation. Since RhoA knockdown had no observable effect on tumor angiogenesis, it is possible that the increased CXCL12 expression might drive the paracrine stimulation of the RhoA knockdown cancer cells\u2019 invasiveness. Therefore, our study suggests that RhoA suppresses breast cancer cell metastatic dissemination by suppressing the invasiveness of tumor cells through reduced expression of the tumor CXCR4 receptor with a subsequent reduction of CAFs in the TME.Similarly, RhoA knockdown primary tumors displayed a significant F4/80 positive macrophage infiltration. This was correlated with an increased expression of stromal-derived CCL5, a well-established chemokine important in recruiting and converting CCR5 positive monocytes into TAMs. In addition to CCR5, monocytes also express CCR2, which is the main receptor for another important immune cell recruiting chemokine CCL2. The expression of CCR5, the cognate receptor for CCL5 was likewise found to be upregulated in RhoA knockdown 4T1 cancer cells. However, the effects of RhoA knockdown on CCR2 expression is not as significant as the effects on CCR5 (unpublished results). It is therefore possible that the upregulation of CCR5 but not CCR2 expression is the major cause of increased F4/80 positive macrophage infiltration in RhoA knockdown tumors. In addition to CXCL12, CAFs were also a source of increased CCL5 expression in RhoA knockdown tumors. It is therefore likely that the increased co-expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 in RhoA knockdown cancer cells facilitates the recruitment of CXCL12/CCL5 secreting CAFs and later the TAMs into the TME. Like CAFs, TAMs have been shown to be pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic. Since RhoA knockdown tumors with significant CAFs and TAMs infiltration showed relatively increased lymph node and lung metastases formation, it is therefore possible that reduced RhoA activity in tumor cells promotes its metastatic dissemination by activating both the CXCL12-CXCR4 and CCL5-CCR5 signaling pathways.Metastatic dissemination and distant colonization are inefficient processes with multiple sequential steps. The systemic metastasis of breast cancer was long thought to be through the intratumoral and peritumoral blood vasculature, even though lymph node metastasis was often associated with tumor aggressiveness and poorer prognosis. It was long believed that LN metastases enter systemic circulation by traveling from SLN to the next through efferent lymphatics until they drain into the thoracic duct and through the neck lympho-vascular anastomosis into the internal jugular vein. However, recent studies using intravital imaging, photo-switchable protein, and cancer cell micro-infusion showed that cancer cells in the SLN are a significant source for distant lung metastases and lymph node-residing tumor cells disseminate by efficiently invading LN blood vasculature rather than by transiting through efferent lymphatic vessels. In the present study, we detected more cancer cells in the SLNs but not in the contralateral lymph nodes of RhoA knockdown mice compared to the control group. Cancer cells tail-vein injection experiments designed to bypass the early steps revealed no difference in cancer cells extravasation and lung colonization between RhoA knockdown and control groups. Taken together, our study suggest that RhoA suppresses the cancer cells\u2019 initial steps of local invasion into SLNs, and subsequent intravasation into LN blood vasculature while has no observable role in the later steps of the metastasis cascade.Knockdown of RhoA expression increases CCR5 and CXCR4 transcripts in 4T1 cancer cells suggesting a possible transcription-regulatory function of RhoA. RhoA GTPases are known for its functions in cytoskeleton dynamics, regulating cell polarity and cell migration and cell cycle progression. However, a lesser-known function of RhoA is its ability to regulate several transcriptional signaling pathways such as NF\u03baB signaling, GATA-4 signaling, CREB signaling, STAT5a signaling and AP-1 signaling. Rho regulates the transcriptional activity of NF\u03baB by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and in breast and prostate cancer cells, NF\u03baB directly upregulates CXCR4 mRNA expression and stability. Although NF-\u03baB has a stimulatory role in regulating chemokines expression in general, it is still conceivable that RhoA negatively regulates NF-\u03baB by decreasing the expression of coactivators required for optimal activity of NF-\u03baB. Similarly, it was also reported that Rho GTPases could modulate the activity of CREB, and CCR5 is a well-established transcriptional target of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Therefore, it is possible that RhoA suppresses CCR5 and CXCR4 expression by impinging on one or more of these transcriptional signaling pathways. In a recent study, Georgouli et al. reported the pivotal role of RhoA-ROCK signaling in driving fast rounded-amoeboid migration in cancer cells during metastasis in a melanoma mouse model. Mechanistically upregulation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway in melanoma cancer cells stimulates the transcription and secretion of an entire cytokine transcriptional program that controls immune cell recruitment into the tumor environment. At present, it is not clear whether the pro-metastatic effect of RhoA is RhoA-effector or cancer type specific.In summary, using a triple negative breast cancer mouse model, we demonstrated that reduced RhoA expression increases breast cancer lymph node and lung metastasis. Potential tumor and metastasis suppressive ability of RhoA in breast cancer have been suggested before. But the current study demonstrated that this is achieved by promoting a pro-tumor microenvironment, with increased CAF and macrophage infiltration, and by modulating the CCL5-CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axes at the primary tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first such mechanistic study in breast cancer, shows the ability of RhoA to suppresses chemokine receptor expression in breast tumor cells, in turn suppressing the breast cancer LN and lung metastasis.Materials and MethodsCell cultureBT20 and MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, HyClone, UT, USA) with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, GA, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (HyClone), and the 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line was cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS, 5% calf serum (Lonza, Switzerland) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

        "title": "Tumor-associated fibroblasts recruit blood monocytes into tumor tissue.",
        "content": "Tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAF) and tumor-associated macrophages are the main stromal components in desmoplastic breast tumors. These host cell types were extensively studied individually with regard to tumor development and progression but little is known about their reciprocal interactions. To elucidate the role of TAF in the recruitment of monocytes (MO) we designed a 3D co-culture system of multicellular fibroblast spheroids of different origin, co-cultured with MO suspensions from healthy donors. Spheroids of tumor-derived but not of normal fibroblasts were extensively infiltrated by MO. A linear correlation between number of infiltrated MO and number of MO applied per spheroid was shown, indicating a distinct migratory MO subpopulation (approximately 15%) within the peripheral blood MO pool. Our data imply that MO migration into fibroblastic tumor areas may partially result from high expression of CCL2 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), which was regulated by endogenous IL-6 as shown by neutralization experiments. The effect of CCL2 on MO migration was inhibited by CCL2 neutralizing antibody in tumor-derived fibroblast conditioned media in a Boyden chamber migration assay but not in spheroid culture. While this phenomenon needs further evaluation, our data clearly support the concept of fibroblasts as \"sentinel cells\" relevant for tumor progression.",

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

Among inflammatory cells identified as important modifiers of tumor microenvironment, mast cells appear to play a crucial role. Indeed, mast cells express a variety of growth factors/angiogenic mediators and their accumulation correlates with increased neovascularization, tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in different solid and hematologic tumors.Prostate tumors are a leading cause of death in the male population of Western countries. Androgen receptor signalling plays a central role in prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy representing the first line of treatment for the advanced disease. However, tumors will eventually progress to an androgen-independent stage with poor prognosis. A correlation has been established between mast cell density and microvessel density in human prostate adenocarcinoma. Tryptase-positive mast cells are present in both intratumoral and peritumoral areas of prostate adenocarcinoma with an overlapping mean density. In addition, mast cell number in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of prostate adenocarcinoma is significantly higher as compared to benign lesions. Moreover, mast cells promote well-differentiated adenocarcinoma growth in human patients and in the autochthonous transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.The members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) gene family exert their activity by binding to tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs). The FGF/FGFR system plays a non-redundant autocrine/paracrine role in the growth, vascularization and progression of prostate tumors towards an hormone-refractory state as the consequence of the deregulation of FGFR signalling. Indeed, prostate tumors express various FGF family members, including FGF2 and FGF8b, with paracrine/autocrine functions on cancer epithelial/stromal cells. In particular, the FGF/FGFR system plays a prominent role during the growth of tumors obtained after grafting of androgen-dependent prostate TRAMP-C2 cells in syngeneic mice. Thus, TRAMP-C2 cells, originated from TRAMP mice, represent a model system suitable for the study of the effects of FGF/FGFR antagonists in the treatment of prostate cancer.Long pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is a member of the pentraxin family produced locally in response to inflammatory signals. PTX3 shares the C-terminal domain with short pentraxins and possesses a unique N-terminal domain. When assessed for the capacity to interact with a variety of growth factors/cytokines, PTX3 was found to bind FGF2 via its N-terminal extension, thus inhibiting FGF2-dependent endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, PTX3 was found to inhibit the growth of various FGF-dependent tumor types (reviewed in). On this basis, pharmacophore modeling of the interaction of a minimal PTX3-derived FGF-binding pentapeptide with FGF2 has been used for the identification of the first small molecule chemical (NSC12) which acts as an extracellular FGF trap with significant implications in cancer therapy.In particular, previous observations had shown that PTX3 overexpression suppresses the angiogenic and tumorigenic potential of TRAMP-C2 cells by inhibiting the FGF-dependent autocrine/paracrine loop of stimulation driven by dihydrotestosterone. Accordingly, injection of TRAMP-C2 cells in transgenic male mice overexpressing PTX3 under the control of the endothelial Tie2-promoter results in a significant inhibition of the growth and vascularization of the tumor graft. Similar results were obtained when TRAMP-C2 cells were grafted in wild-type mice treated with the PTX3-derived small molecule FGF-trap.Mast cells express FGFRs and respond chemotactically to FGF2 stimulation. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of FGF2 to induce an angiogenic response and mast cell recruitment in vivo in a murine Matrigel plug assay. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of the inhibition of the FGF/FGFR system by genetic and pharmacologic approaches on mast cell recruitment in prostate cancer. In a first set of experiments, FGF-dependent TRAMP-C2 cells were injected s.c. in syngeneic wild-type and in PTX3-overexpressing transgenic TgN(Tie2-hPTX3) male mice. In a second set of experiments, TRAMP-C2 cells were grafted s.c. in wild type mice that were treated i.p. with the pan-FGF trap NSC12 inhibitor or the control compound NSC21. In both experimental conditions, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on harvested tumors to evaluate mast cell density in peripheral and central areas of the grafts and to correlate these values with the neovascular response in the same areas.RESULTSFGF2 recruits mast cells in the in vivo Matrigel plug assayThe capacity of FGF2 to induce an angiogenic response and mast cell recruitment was investigated in vivo by quantitative PCR analysis applied to a murine Matrigel plug assay. As shown in Figure 1, FGF2-treated plugs exert a remarkable neovascular and mast cell chemoattractant response, as showed by the significant upregulation of the expression of lineage specific endothelial CD31 and mast cell tryptase, chymase and CD117 transcripts in respect to control plugs. These data extend previous observations about the capacity of FGF2 to induce a chemotactic response on mast cells in vitro.FGF2 induces an angiogenic response and mast cell recruitment in vivoMatrigel plugs (n = 4\u20138) containing PBS or 4.0 pmoles of FGF2 were implanted in the flank of female C57BL/6 mice. After 7 days, plugs were harvested and the levels of expression of lineage specific endothelial marker CD31 and mast cell tryptase, chymase and CD117 markers were assessed by qPCR analysis. Data are means \u00b1 SEM. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 versus PBS; Student\u2019s t test.Impact of anti-FGF approaches on the growth of prostate TRAMP-C2 tumor graftsGenetic and pharmacologic anti-FGF approaches were used to investigate the impact of the inhibition of the FGF/FGFR system on mast cell recruitment in prostate cancer. In a first set of experiments, FGF-dependent TRAMP-C2 cells were injected s.c. in syngeneic wild-type and PTX3-overexpressing transgenic TgN(Tie2-hPTX3) male mice. In a second set of experiments, TRAMP-C2 cells were grafted s.c. in wild type mice that were treated i.p. with the pan-FGF trap inhibitor NSC12 (Supplementary Figure 1) or the control compound NSC21. In agreement with previous observations, both anti-FGF approaches resulted in a significant reduction of tumor weight at sacrifice (Figure 2). On this basis, harvested grafts were analyzed for vascularization and mast cell infiltration by immunohistochemistry.Inhibition of prostate TRAMP-C2 tumor grafts by FGF inhibitors(A) FGF-dependent TRAMP-C2 cells were injected s.c. in syngeneic wild-type and in PTX3-overexpressing transgenic TgN(Tie2-hPTX3) male mice that were sacrificed 37 days after grafting (n = 6).

Tumors were harvested, weighted and processed for IHC analysis.

As shown in Figure 3, the density of CD31-positive cells was decreased in both central (13.56% \u00b1 SE 1.59%) and peripheral (17.50% \u00b1 SE 1.50%) areas of tumors harvested from TgN(Tie2-hPTX3) mice as compared to grafts obtained in WT animals (33.18% \u00b1 SE 1.33%, center; 38.79 \u00b1 SE 4.9%, periphery). Accordingly, tryptase-positive mast cell infiltrate was less abundant in both central and peripheral areas of TRAMP-C2 tumor grafts generated in transgenic mice (0.27% \u00b1 SE 0.04% and 0.52% \u00b1 SE 0.08%, respectively) as compared to that measured in WT animals (0.68% \u00b1 SE 0.12% and 0.89% \u00b1 SE 0.05%, respectively) (Figure 4). Notably, mast cell infiltrate at the periphery of TRAMP-C2 tumor lesions grown in TgN(Tie2-hPTX3) mice appears to be more abundant than in the central areas of the lesion (*p< 0.05).Immunohistochemical (A-D) and morphometric analysis (E) of CD31 immunoreactivity in central (A-B) and peripheral (C-D) areas of TRAMP-C2 grafts harvested from wild type (WT) (A-C) and TgN(Tie2-hPTX3) (C-D) mice.

Indeed, the density of CD31-positive endothelial cells was decreased in both central (4.26% \u00b1 SE 0.45%) and peripheral (5.56% \u00b1 SE 2.55%) areas of NSC12-treated samples as compared to NSC21-treated (12.54% \u00b1 SE 1.89%; 17.15\u00b1 SE 1.02%) or DMSO-treated (10.89% \u00b1 SE 0.92%; 24.09 \u00b1 SE 2.86%) specimens (Figure 5). Similarly, tryptase-positive mast cell infiltrate was decreased in NSC12 samples in both central (0.44% \u00b1 SE 0.06%) and peripheral (0.39% \u00b1 SE 0.01%) areas as compared to NSC21 (0.79% \u00b1 SE 0.05%; 0.75\u00b1 SE 0.11%) and DMSO (0.8% \u00b1 SE 0.09%; 0.68 \u00b1 SE 0.01%) specimens (Figure 6).Immunohistochemical (A-F) and morphometric analysis (G) of CD31 immunoreactivity in central (A-C) and peripheral (D-F) areas of TRAMP-C2 grafts harvested from wild-type mice treated i.p. with NSC21 (A-D), DMSO (B, E) or NSC12 (C-F).

In addition, in keeping with the potent pro-angiogenic activity of this growth factor, mast cell recruitment was paralleled by a significant upregulation of the endothelial marker CD31 in FGF2 plugs when compared to controls. Conversely, our data indicate that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the FGF/FGFR system in a murine model of prostate cancer results in a significant inhibition of tumor growth and neovascularization that are constantly associated to a reduction of mast cell density in both the peripheral and central areas of the tumor. These data confirm and extend previous observations about FGFR expression in mast cells and the capacity of these cells to respond chemotactically to FGF2 stimulation in vitro. In addition, they provide indirect evidence about a relationship among mast cell recruitment, angiogenesis, and tumor growth in human prostate adenocarcinoma. Although mast cell recruitment in the tumor tissues was reduced by FGF blockade, the decrease in vascularization appears to be more pronounced when compared to the reduction in the mast cell infiltrate. This may represent the consequence of the multi-targeting effects of anti-FGF approaches in the control of tumor angiogenesis that may result in a direct inhibition of endothelial cells as well as of tumor and infiltrating stromal cells, including mast cells.As observed for tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), mast cells may exert both pro- and anti-tumor effects. Indeed, mast cells induce immunosuppression by releasing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin10 (IL-10), involved in promoting the immune tolerance mediated by regulatory T cells. In addition, mast cells may promote inflammation, inhibition of tumor cell growth, and tumor cell apoptosis by releasing interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-3 and-4 (MCP-3 and MCP-4), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), and chymase.In prostate cancer, Fleischmann et al. found a strong association among high mast cell counts and Gleason score, early tumor stage, and low risk for recurrence. At variance, Nonomura et al. reported that a decreased number of mast cells correlates with a better prognosis in prostate cancer. Notably, Johansson et al. demonstrated that prostate peritumoral mast cells stimulate angiogenesis and tumor growth by secreting FGF2 whereas intratumoral mast cells correlate negatively with the presence of metastases, tumor stage, Gleason score, angiogenesis, and tumor cell proliferation, being associated to a good prognosis. Mast cells synthesize and release potent angiogenic cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FGF2, the serine proteases tryptase and chymase, IL-8, TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and nerve growth factor (NGF). Mast cell-secreted molecules facilitate tumor vascularization not only by a direct angiogenic effect but also by stimulating other inflammatory cells of the tumor microenvironment to release angiogenic mediators and cytokines as well as extracellular matrix-degrading proteases. Indeed, an increased number of mast cells have been demonstrated to be associated with angiogenesis in a variety vascular, haematological and solid tumors.Mast cells have been indicated as a novel prognostic marker and a target for therapy associated with castration in prostate cancer. In patients, mast cells are recruited to the tumoral compartment during the formation of castrate-resistant prostate tumors. In a rat orthotopic prostate tumor model, mast cells infiltrate tumors that relapse after an initial response to castration treatment. This occurs in association with increased angiogenesis and FGF2 upregulation.Mast cells might act as a new target for the adjuvant treatment of tumors through the selective inhibition of angiogenesis, tissue remodeling and tumor promoting molecules, allowing the secretion of cytotoxic cytokines and preventing mast cell mediated immune-suppression. Pre-clinical studies using anti-c-kit antibodies, anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies, or the mast cells stabilizer disodium cromoglycate (cromolyn) have demonstrated promising results in mouse models. Masatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets c-kit receptors and is clinically developed and approved for treatment of recurrent or unresectable grade III dog mast cell tumors and is the first approved anticancer drug in veterinary medicine. Masatinib has been translated to human clinical trials for its evaluation in gastro intestinal stromal tumor (GIST), mastocytosis and pancreatic cancer.Here, in agreement with previous findings, we show that PTX3 overexpression or treatment with the PTX3-derived small molecule FGF trap NSC12 result in a significant inhibition of the growth of TRAMP-C2 tumor grafts, a murine model of prostate cancer. This was paralleled by a decrease of mast cell infiltrate into the lesion. This may represent the result of a multi-target effect of these anti-FGF approaches on different tumor compartments that may cause the inhibition of FGF-mediated mast cell recruitment into the tumor and the inhibition of the mitogenic and angiogenic activity exerted by FGF molecules produced by the tumor parenchyma and stroma, including recruited mast cells. Even though further studies will be required to elucidate this complex interplay, our observations indicate that small FGF trap molecules may represent the basis for novel approaches in the therapy of prostate cancer. In conclusion, this work provides further insights about the role of the FGF/FGFR system and mast cells in the control of prostate tumor growth and angiogenesis, demonstrating for the first time in an in vivo prostate tumor model that mast cell recruitment at the tumor site and tumor neovascularization are two strictly FGF-dependent correlated events.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and cell culturesCompound NSC12 was synthesized by M. Mor (University of Parma, Italy) as described and control compound NSC21 was provided by Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute (USA). Human recombinant FGF2 was from Tecnogen (Caserta, Italy). Murine prostate adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C2 cells were obtained from ATCC repository and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.0 mM glutamine, 5 mg/L bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 nM DHT as described.Matrigel plug angiogenesis assaySix-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 400 \u03bcl of Matrigel (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) containing PBS or 4.0 pmoles of FGF2. After 7 days, pellets were processed for total RNA extraction after adding to each plug a fixed amount of human cells as an internal standard. Then, samples were analyzed for the expression of the indicated genes by real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and data were normalized for human GAPDH expression levels as described. To this purpose, total RNA was extracted from Matrigel plugs using TRIzol Reagent according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen). Contaminating DNA was digested using DNAse (Promega), 2.0 \u03bcg of total RNA were retro-transcribed with MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using random hexaprimers. Quantitative PCR was performed with a ViiATM 7 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using iQTM SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In each experiment, an arbitrary value equal to 1.0 was assigned to the levels of expression of the gene(s) measured in one PBS Matrigel sample that was used as reference.The following primers were used: murine CD31, 5\u2019-CGGTTATGATGATGTTTCTGGA (forward) and 5\u2019-AAGGGAGGACACTTCCACTTCT (reverse); murine Tryptase beta 2, 5\u2019- CCTCTCCCACCTCCTTATCC (forward) and 5\u2019-CCCTTCACTTTGCAGACCAG (reverse); murine Chymase 1, 5\u2019 GGCAGAACAAACGTGAATGA (forward) and 5\u2019-CTATCCCAGCACACAGCAGA (reverse); murine CD117, 5\u2019-GTGAACCAACTTCGCCTGAC (forward) and 5\u2019- GAATCCCTCTGCCACACACT (reverse); human GAPDH, 5\u2019- GAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATT (forward) and 5\u2019- TGACGGTGCCATGGAATTTG (reverse).In vivo tumor modelsWild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Envigo (Correzzana, Italy). Transgenic TgN(Tie2-hPTX3) mice overexpressing hPTX3 under the control of the endothelial specific Tie2 promoter were generated as described. In a first set of experiments, nine-week-old wild-type and TgN(Tie2-hPTX3) male mice were injected s.c. into the dorsolateral flank with 5x106 TRAMP-C2 cells in 200 \u03bcl total volume of PBS and sacrificed at day 37. In a second set of experiments, 5x106 TRAMP-C2 cells were injected s.c. into the dorsolateral flank of wild-type mice. After 30 days, vehicle (DMSO), NSC12 or NSC21 (both at 7.5 mg/kg) were injected i.p., twice a week, in 100 \u03bcl final volume. At the end of the experimental procedure (49 days after tumor cell grafting), tumors were harvested, weighted and paraffin embedded for immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded tumor sections.CD31 and tryptase immunohistochemistryHistological sections (4 \u03bcm thickness) were collected on poly-L-lysine-coated slides (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA) and deparaffinized. Sections were rehydrated in a xylene-graded alcohol scale and then rinsed for 10 minutes in 0.1 M PBS. Sections were pre-treated with sodium citrate pH 6.1 (Dako Corporation, Milan, Italy) in Dako PT Link for antigen retrieval solution for 30 minutes at 98\u00b0C and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-CD31 antibody (ab28364, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or mouse monoclonal anti-tryptase antibody (NB-100-64820, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) diluted 1:60 and 1:1000, respectively. Then, sections were counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin and mounted in synthetic medium. Specific preimmune serum (Dako), replacing the primary antibodies, served as negative control. Sections from each experimental group (n = 10; 10 cases per group) were scanned using the whole-slide morphometric analysis scanning platform Aperio Scanscope CS (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany). All the slides were scanned at the maximum available magnification (40\u00d7) and stored as digital high resolution images on the workstation associated with the instrument. Digital slides were inspected with Aperio ImageScope v.11 software (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) at 20\u00d7 magnification and 10 fields with an equal area were selected for the analysis at 40\u00d7 magnification. The protein expression was assessed with the Positive Pixel Count algorithm embedded in the Aperio ImageScope software and reported as positivity percentage, defined as the number of positively stained pixels on the total pixels in the image.Statistical analysisData related to the experimental groups, WT and TgN(Tie2-hPTX3), NSC12, NSC21 and vehicle samples are reported as means \u00b1 SEM. Bonferroni post-test was used to compare all treatment groups after one-way ANOVA. The Graph Pad Prism 5.0 statistical package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for analyses and the limit for statistical significance was set at P<0.05.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGUREAuthor contributionsRR and DC performed in vivo experiments an analyzed the data; RT and SR acquired and analyzed immunohistochemical data; DR and MP wrote the manuscript.

In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

        "content": "A constitutive and dynamic interaction between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma is a prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (collectively called cancer associated fibroblasts, CAFs) often represent the major cellular components of tumor stroma. Tumor cells secret different growth factors which induce CAFs proliferation and differentiation, and, consequently, CAFs secrete different chemokines, cytokines or growth factors which induce tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In this study we showed here that CAFs from breast cancer surgical specimens significantly induced the invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Most interestingly, the novel multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dovitinib significantly blocked the CAFs-induced invasion of breast cancer cells by, at least in part, inhibition of the expression and secretion of CCL2, CCL5 and VEGF in CAFs. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could be responsible for the effects of Dovitinib, since Dovitinib antagonized the promoted phosphorylated Akt after treatment with PDGF, FGF or breast cancer cell-conditioned media. Treatment with Dovitinib in combination with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitors Ly294002 or RAD001 resulted in additive inhibition of cell invasion. This is the first in vitro study to show that the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor has therapeutic activities against breast cancer metastasis by targeting both tumor cells and CAFs. ",

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

Northern blot analysis revealed that B7-H3 is encoded by 4.1 kb mRNA, which is widely expressed in human tissues, but is limited in B7-H3 protein expression. There is an aberrant expression of B7-H3 molecules in both tumor cells and interstitial cells. cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are mainly derived from five types of cells, mainly expressing \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, vimentin and fibroblast activation protein,which are the main components of host cells in the tumor microenvironment. Several studies have highlighted that CAFs can enhance tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis by means of releasing multiple cytokines.Renal cancer is a relatively common malignant carcinoma, accounting for 2\u20133% of adult malignant tumors. A distinctly worrying statistic revealed that approximately 20\u201330% of patients are found to have distant metastases when initially diagnosed with renal cancer. The currently existing treatment options for renal cancer have low sensitivity toward radiotherapy and chemotherapy, leaving patients with high risk of recurrence following surgery and therefore the overall survival rate of patients with renal cancer remains low. Due to the above dilemma, there is an urgent need in finding a new and improved therapeutic approach in forms of tumor gene therapy or immunotherapy for the treatment of kidney cancer.Previous studies have linked the high expression of B7-H3 with an increase in the probability of tumor cell metastasis and increased chance of recurrence following surgery. At present, there is no research on the biological behavior and mechanism of B7-H3+CAFs on renal cancer cells. Our study used shRNA-mediated gene silencing to study the biological function of B7-H3 on CAFs, and further elucidated the progression of renal cell carcinoma through changes in the biological function of CAFs.MethodsEthics statementAll related experiments had been approved and supervised by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and all patients enrolled in the study had signed written informed consent. Each procedure was performed in strict accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The animal experiment is in strict accordance with the \u201cGuiding Opinions on the Treatment of Experiment of Animal\u201d and the \u201cAdministrative Measures for Laboratory Animals in Jiangsu Province.\u201dTumor tissue samplesTen renal cancer tissue specimens were obtained via radical nephrectomy at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between June 2016 and August 2016. None of the patients received preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy before the surgery. All patients were confirmed by pathological diagnosis.Preparation of single cell suspension of renal cancer tissueFresh renal cancer tissue was placed in a six-well plate, and washed with PBS (HyClone, USA) for the removal of blood clots, fat and capsule. After additional rinsing, the tissue samples were cut with scissors, followed by the removal of PBS and the addition of type IV collagenase solution 2 mL (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The six-well plate was incubated under 37\u00b0C, in CO2 incubator for 1.5 hrs, followed by the addition of 1 mL of medium to stop digestion. A 300-mesh stainless steel filter sieve was placed in the culture dish, and the tissue in the well was transferred to a filter sieve for thorough grinding, followed by rinsing with PBS. The filtrate was filtered to a centrifuge tube, filtered through a cell sieve, centrifuged for 5 mins then discarded. The supernatant was removed, and the lower layer pellet was resuspended in PBS to 1 mL and stored in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C.Cell cultureHuman renal cancer cell line (A498) and CAFs cell line were purchased from the Chinese Academy of Sciences cell bank. RPMI1640 and DMEM high glucose medium (Gibco, USA) containing 10% FBS (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin and Streptomyces (Beyotime, People's Republic of China) mixture, respectively, cultured in a 37\u00b0C, 5% saturated humidity incubator.Flow cytometry for detection of CD29 and B7-H3 (CD276) expression in renal cell carcinoma tissue50 \u03bcL of tumor cell suspension in the flow tube of No. 1\u20135 was added to flow antibody 2 \u03bcL, respectively. The entire process was performed on ice. The flow scheme was conducted as follows: tube No. 1 was the blank control tube, tube No. 2 was added to PE/Cy7 CD45, tube No. 3 was added to APC CD29, tube No. 4 was added to PE/Cy7 CD45+APC CD29 and tube No. 5 was added to PE/Cy7 CD45+APC CD29+PE CD276 (Biolegend, USA). Once each tube was thoroughly blown, incubation was carried out in a refrigerator at 4\u00b0C for 30 mins. The flow tube was removed, and each tube was added with 1 mL of PBS, and centrifuged, with the supernatant discharged, and resuspended to 500 \u03bcL with PBS, and detected by flow cytometry.Cell transfectionThe silencing of B7-H3 sequences was designed by Shanghai GeneChem Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, People's Republic of China) and hU6-MCS-Ubiquitin-EGFP-IRES-puromycin as plasmid vector. Endogenous B7-H3 expression in CAFs cells was knocked down with siRNA with the following target sequence: the sense sequence is 5-GUGCUG-GAGAAAGAUCAAATT-3, and the anti-sense sequence is 5-UUUGAUCUUUCUCCAGCACTT-3. The cells were seeded in 6-well plates, 24 hrs after the cell attachment, the virus liquid was mixed in the culture medium. The cells were screened with puromycin dihydrochloride (2 \u00b5g/mL; Amresco, USA) 72 hrs later. After 3 days post-transfection, 90% of the cells were transfected by observing the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)P. There were respective two experimental groups for CAFs cells: cells transfected with lentivirus-mediated shRNA-targeted B7-H3 were named CAFs-shRNA cells, while cells transfected with lentivirus-mediated shRNA (negative control, NC) were named CAFs-NC cells.CAFs-shRNA cell proliferation assayThe differences in proliferation between CAFs-shRNA and CAFs-NC cells were determined by CCK8 assay (Dojindo, Japan). The two groups of cells were inoculated into a 96-well plate at 4\u00d7103 cells/well, and cultured in a 37\u00b0C, 5% saturated humidity incubator. The OD values were measured at four different time points at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hrs at 450 nm.CAFs-shRNA cell apoptosis and cycle assayApoptosis detection was performed using the Annexin V-PE Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD, USA). CAFs-shRNA and CAFs-NC cells were infected for 1 week, trypsinized, centrifuged, resuspended in PBS, stained with Annexin V-PE/PI and detected by flow cytometry. Cell cycle assays were performed using a PI staining kit (BD, USA). Cellular DNA content was detected on the basis of the relative proportion of cells at the G1/G0, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.Western blotCAFs-shRNA cells and CAFs-NC cells were separately added to 100 \u00b5L of lysate (Beyotime, People's Republic of China) for 30 mins on ice, after which centrifugation was conducted at 4\u00b0C to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant was then mixed with SDS protein loading buffer at 100\u00b0C for 10 mins. Next, a 30 \u00b5g protein sample was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk prepared in TBST for 1 hr at room temperature, and incubated with a specific primary antibody, including B7-H3, Bcl-2, Bax, Apaf1, cytochrome C, caspase-3, P-AKT, AKT, cyclin D1 (CST, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, three wash sessions were performed using TBST (5 mins each time). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature, with the membrane washed and developed accordingly.Real-time PCRAfter 2 weeks of culture of CAFs-shRNA cells and CAFs-NC cells, total RNA was extracted from each group of cells using Trizol (Beyotime, People's Republic of China), with the absorbance ratio of the sample RNA measured at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm. The purity and concentration were then measured. Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was performed using the Takara Reverse Transcription Kit, 20 \u00b5l system, with the target gene detected by real-time PCR.A498 cell proliferation assayThe effects of CAFs-shRNA and CAFs-NC cells on the proliferation of the A498 cells were determined using a CCK8 assay. The lower chamber of Transwell 96-well plate was inoculated with A498at 4\u00d7103 cells/well, and 1.0\u00d7104 CAFs-shRNA and CAFs-NC cells were added to the upper chamber, and cultured at 37\u00b0C in a 5% saturated humidity incubator. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hrs.Invasion and migration assayDuring the migration test, CAFs-shRNA and CAFs-NC cells were inoculated into the Transwell (Corning, USA) lower chamber at 2.5\u00d7104 cells/well overnight. Then, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium the next day. Renal cell carcinoma cells were diluted to 1\u00d7106 cells/mL in serum-free medium, with 200 \u00b5L added to the upper chamber. After incubation in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 24 hrs, 5% paraformaldehyde was used to fix the chamber for 15 mins. Crystal violet staining was performed over a period of 10 mins, with the cells failing to pass wiped with a cotton ball. Five fields were taken from the top, bottom, left and right of the microscope, photographed and statistically analyzed. During the invasion test, CAFs-shRNA and CAFs-NC cells were inoculated into the Transwell lower chamber at 2.5\u00d7104 cells/well. Matrigel (Corning, USA) was pre-plated on the bottom membrane of the upper chamber. The A498 cell suspension was then added, and cultured at 37\u00b0C in an incubator for 24 hrs. The cells were fixed and stained. With five fields of view from top to bottom, left and right obtained, the cells were photographed, and analyzed statistically.Tumor growth in vivoCAFs-shRNA cells and CAFs-NC cells (1.0\u00d7106 cells) were mixed with A498 cells (1.0\u00d7106 cells), respectively, and subcutaneously injected into 8-week-old male BALB/c nude mice. There were a total of eight mice, with 4 mice in each group. Tumor size was recorded every 3 days. The tumors were collected approximately 6 weeks after injection.Statistical analysisMapping and data analyses were performed using Flowjo-V10, GraphPad Prism 7.0 and SPSS 23 statistical software. Experimental data were expressed as mean\u00b1SD. The mean comparison between the two groups was performed by two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test test with p<0.05 considered as statistically significant.ResultsCAFs expressing B7-H3 molecules were found in renal cell carcinoma tissueFlow cytometric analysis of cell surface B7-H3 expression levels of CAFs in renal cell carcinoma. (A) FS-SS scatter plot to circle large cell populations and remove dead cells; (B) circle out cell populations that do not express CD45; (C, D) Isotype control; (E) the double positive region is B7-H3+CAFscells, which is about 65.3%. CD45-negative and CD29-positive were used for flow cytometry in order to demonstrate the presence of a panel of B7-H3 expressing fibroblasts in renal cell carcinoma. The flow cytometric analysis of single-cell suspensions of renal cell carcinoma revealed that there is a group of B7-H3+CAFs among the renal cell carcinoma tissues (Figure 1). Transfection efficiency verification(A) The transfection efficiencies observed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) using fluorescence microscopy; (B) B7-H3 expression levels detected in CAFs by flow cytometry; (C) B7-H3 expression levels in CAFs detected by Western blot; (D) B7-H3 mRNA level determined by Q-PCR. *P\uff1c0.05.After transfecting CAFs cells with B7-H3-shRNA and negative control virus, green fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm. The results obtained from fluorescence microscopy showed that the transfection efficiencies of the B7-H3-shRNA and negative control virus, which both exceeded 90%, were satisfactory (Figure 2A). Flow cytometry was used to detect B7-H3 protein in CAFs cells for assessing whether B7-H3-shRNA effectively silences B7-H3 expression in CAF cells. As shown in Figure 2B, the expression of B7-H3 protein in the experimental group was 14.4%. Subsequently, total protein was extracted from CAFs cells, and B7-H3 expression in cell lysates was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Figure 2C, a significant decrease in B7-H3 protein expression was observed after transfection with B7-H3-shRNA in comparison to the cells from the control group. Simultaneously, the expression level of B7-H3 mRNA was lower than that of the CAFs-NC group (Figure 2D). Therefore, the CAFs-shRNA stable line, named CAF-shRNA cells, was used for further analysis. B7-H3 silencing reduced CAFs cell proliferation and induces apoptosisSilencing B7-H3 reduces cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) proliferation and induces apoptosis. (A) Viability measured by cck8 assay in CAFs cells; (B) cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis of CAFs cells were identified by flow cytometry. *P\uff1c0.05; **P\uff1c0.01.CCK-8 assay was performed for the detection of the potential effect of RNAi-mediated downregulation of B7-H3 on CAFs cell growth. In Figure 3A, the results show that CAFs-shRNA cell growth rate is significantly reduced on day 2 as compared to CAFs-NC cells (p<0.01). In Figure 3B, flow cytometry analysis results revealed that CAFs-shRNA cells were arrested at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in comparison to CAFs-NC cells (52.391\u00b10.923 and 24.446\u00b10.698, p<0.01). The percentage of S+G2/M phase in CAFs-shRNA cells was lower than that in CAFs-NC cells (44.353\u00b12.601 and 79.121\u00b14.502, p<0.01). These results demonstrated that in the event that B7-H3 expression was decreased, the percentage of G0/G1 increased and the proportion of S+G2/M was decreased. Those findings suggested that B7-H3 gene silencing resulted in G0/G1 arrest and ultimately inhibiting CAFs proliferation. At the same time, Annexin V-PE/PI double staining was applied to detect apoptosis. The percentage of early apoptosis of CAFs-shRNA was higher than that of CAFs-NC (25.567\u00b17.023 and 4.083\u00b11.499, p<0.05). There was no significant difference regarding the apoptosis rate between the two groups (2.187\u00b11.007 and 4.243\u00b10.996, p>0.05). The experimental data suggested that downregulation of B7-H3 expression could potentially induce CAF apoptosis. Changes in genes and related protein molecules after B7-H3 silencing(A) Silencing B7-H3 molecular expression leads to differential gene expression analysis in cancer-associated fibroblasts\u00a0(CAFs ); (B) B7-H3 regulates protein expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins. The changes that occurred following the silencing of B7-H3 molecules by gene chip method were analyzed in signaling molecules in CAF cells. Based on the findings, B7-H3 signal could potentially lead to the upregulation of 4,531 genes and the downregulation of 3,677 genes (Figure 4A). Compared with the control group (NC), many signal molecules were changed in the experimental group. For example, the expressions of p-akt, bcl-2, cyclin D1 and HGF were downregulated and the expressions of Bad and caspase-3 were upregulated. Based on these results, we conducted further experiments to determine the underlying molecular mechanism by which B7-H3 signaling confers its anti-apoptotic effect.To further investigate the composition of B7-H3 gene silencing on CAF apoptosis and the periodic signaling pathway, Western blot analysis was performed to detect apoptosis and expression of cell cycle-related proteins. The results revealed that there was an increase in pro-apoptotic Bax, decrease of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and cell cycle associated cyclin D1, decrease of Apaf-1 and cytochrome C, and activation of caspase-3 all in comparison to controls. Furthermore, the knockdown of B7-H3 decreased AKT phosphorylation, but did not affect total AKT protein expression level in CAFs-shRNA cells (Figure 4B).A link of CAFs-shRNA to tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasionEffect of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-shRNA on proliferation, migration and invasion of A498 cells. (A) B7-H3 regulates protein expression levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) protein and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12) protein; (B) CAFs-shRNA cells inhibit the proliferation of A498 cells; (C) CAFs-shRNA reduces migration and invasion of A498 cells; (D) effect of CAFs-shRNA on renal cell carcinoma in vivo. *P\uff1c0.05; **P\uff1c0.01; ***P\uff1c0.001.CCK-8 assay was performed to detect the effect of CAFs-shRNA on the proliferation of A498 cells. As shown in Figure 5B, the proliferation of CAFs-shRNA+A498 cells was significantly reduced (p<0.05) compared to that of CAFs-NC+A498 cells. Next, Transwell method was used to evaluate the effect of CAFs-shRNA on A498 migration and invasion. As shown in Figure 5C, the migration and invasion ability of CAFs-shRNA cells of A498 was lower than that of CAFs-NC cells (p<0.05). These findings suggested that CAFs-NC promotes motility and invasion of A498 cells. A xenograft tumor model of BALB/c nude mice was established by injecting stable CAFs-shRNA+A498 cells and CAFs-NC+A498 cells into the bare groin to confirm the function of B7-H3 in vivo renal cancer. The size of the tumor volume is shown in Figure 5D. The results showed that the tumor volume of nude mice injected with CAFs-shRNA+A498 cells was smaller than that of nude mice injected with CAFs-NC+A498 cells (p<0.001). Our data indicate that silencing of the B7-H3 gene on CAFs leads to inhibition of tumor growth. After Western blot analysis, we observed a decrease in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) protein and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12) protein relative to controls (Figure 5A). DiscussionAs an immunomodulatory molecule, B7-H3 plays multiple roles in different types of human tumors. Moreover, the role of B7-H3 in tumor immunity is complex due to the co-stimulatory and co-suppressive effects of T cells. The present study was conducted with the main focus on the association between B7-H3+CAFs and tumor progression in renal cancer.In this study, we first explored the effects of B7-H3 on the biological function of CAFs. According to the results, B7-H3 gene silencing significantly inhibits cell proliferation, increases apoptosis, inhibits cell cycle, and decreases expression of HGF protein and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (Cxcl12) protein. Previous study has confirmed that CAFs can promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. CAFs apoptosis could provide a therapeutic option for tumors base on previous studies, Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis by preventing pro-apoptotic molecules from mitochondria into the cytosol, while Bax promotes apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio controls the ultimate sensitivity to cell death stimuli. Apaf-1 plays an important role in the mitochondrial pathway, as it facilitates several processed, including the formation of apoptotic bodies with cytochrome C and dATP, activation of caspase-3 and inducing cell apoptosis. Our study found that the transfection of CAFs cells with B7-H3-shRNA results in a decrease in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, while increasing the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and the Apaf-1 protein and cytochrome C protein. An increase in level of pro-apoptotic proteins and/or decreased anti-apoptotic proteins could lead to apoptosis. Moreover, there exist complex links between cell cycle and cell apoptosis. Generally, cell cycle arrest is followed by the apoptosis of cells. In the present study, B7-H3 gene silencing blocked the conversion of cyclin D1 from G0/G1 to S and G2/M, and decreased cyclin D1 expression.The effect of B7-H3+CAFs on the aggressive behavior of renal cell carcinoma cell line (A498) was explored. Our in vitro demonstrated that B7-H3+CAFs plays a significant role in tumor growth and metastatic progression. The orthotopic xenograft tumor model of nude mice was also established to further confirm the effect of B7-H3+CAFs on the growth of tumors in vivo. The results indicated that CAFs-shRNA facilitates the decline in growth rate of xenografts in vivo and has a potent therapeutic effect against tumor cells. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of HGF protein and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (Cxcl-12) protein decreased as compared with the control group. Previous study has reported that CAFs could secrete HGF and promote tumor development. Simultaneously, Cxcl-12 secreted by CAFs binds to CXCR4 and mediates cancer cell growth and mitosis through transcription-dependent or non-transcription-dependent pathways, promoting cell proliferation and invasion and metastasis.The AKT pathway plays a significant role in several biological functions in various human cancers. The downregulation of AKT expression could inhibit tumor cell proliferation and increase apoptosis, while the downstream targets of AKT have been identified as the molecules correlated with apoptosis, such as Bcl-2 and caspase-3. The increase of AKT activation and apoptosis protein could increase the permeability of mitochondrial membrane. The combination of cytochrome C and apaf-1 stimulated the activation of caspase-3. In this study, B7-H3-shRNA induced B7-H3 gene silencing inhibited AKT phosphorylation. We also found that inhibition of AKT phosphorylation through the silencing of B7-H3 suggests that B7-H3 inhibition might be responsible for reducing the expression of HGF protein and Cxcl12 protein in CAFs cells through the AKT pathway, increasing apoptosis and preventing cell cycle process. These results suggest that there could be a potential correlation between B7-H3 and AKT signaling pathway.In conclusion, this study found that B7-H3+ CAFs are associated with tumor progression in renal cell carcinoma and might be a potential target for the treatment of human renal cell carcinoma in the future. However, our study had limitations due to lack of experimental funds and laboratory conditions. In addition, this study was performed in tumor-forming experiments, and there were no further animal experiments performed for further confirmation. Therefore, these key points, along with the specific molecular mechanism of B7-H3, are worth exploring in future studies on a larger scale.DisclosureThe authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.ReferencesMolecular characterization of human 4Ig-B7-H3,a member of B7 family with four Ig-like domainsMolecular and biological characterization of human 4-1bb and its ligandOverexpression of B7-H3 augments anti-apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells by Jak2-STAT3Hepatocellular carcinomas promote tumor-associated macrophage M2-polarization via increased B7-H3 expressionB7-H3 in combination with regulatory T cell is associated with tumor progression in primary human non-small cell lung cancerAberrant expression of B7-H3 in gastric adenocarcinoma promotes cancer cell metastasisB7-H3 expression in breast cancer and upregulation of VEGF through gene silenceB7-H3 over expression in prostate cancer promotes tumor cell progressionNPPB is a novel candidate biomarker expressed by cancer - associated fibroblasts in epithelial ovarian cancerDeregulation of selective autophagy during aging and pulmonary fibrosis: the role of TGF\u03b21Inhibition of Nox4 - dependent ROS signaling attenuates prostate fibroblast activation and abrogates stromal - mediated protumorigenic interactionsPhenotypic and functional heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast within the tumor microenvironmentA cancer stem cell model as the point of origin of cancerassociated fibroblasts in tumor microenvironmentFibroblast hepatocyte growth factor promotes invasion of human mammary ductal carcinoma in situCXCL14 is an autocrine growth factor for fibroblasts and acts as a multi-modal stimulator of prostate tumor growthMMP13 as a stromal mediator in controllingg persistent angiogenesis in skin carcinomaFibroblasts in cancerRenal cell carcinomaCancer statisticsCombination of quantita-tive IMP3 and tumor stage: a new system to predict metastasis for patients with localized renal cell carcinomasAdjuvant therapy for locally advanced renal cell cancer: a systematic review with meta-analysisState-of-the-science: an update on renal cell carcinomaStage migration and increasing proportion of favor-able-prognosis metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients: implications for clinical trial designand interpretationMicroRNA-187 inhibits tumor growth and invasion by directly targeting CD276 in colorectal cancerHuman recombinant B7-H3 expressed in E coli enhances T lymphocyte proliferation and IL-10 secretion in vitroDuplication of primate and rodent B7-H3 immunoglobulin V-and C-like domains\uff1adivergent history of functional redundancy and exon lossCancer associated fibroblasts: the dark side of the coinMitochondria and cell death: outer membrane permeabilization and beyondThe expanding role of mitochondria in apoptosisAcetylation of p53 at lysine 120 upregulates Apaf1 and sensitizes mitochondrial apoptotic pathwayApoptosis and the cell cycleCancer-associated fibroblasts drive glycolysis in a targetable signaling loop implicated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progressionCxcl12 chemokine expression suppresses human pancreatic cancer growth and metastasisCXCL12/CXCR4 axis plays pivotal roles in the organ specific metastasis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma:a clinical studyTargeting CXCL12 from FAP-expressing carcinoma-associated fibroblasts synergizes with anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in pancreatic cancerSuppression of AKT expression by miR-153 produced anti-tumor activity in lung cancerNormal endometrial stromal cells regulate survival and apoptosis signaling through PI3K/AKt/Survivin pathway in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells in vitroAKT phosphorylation of BAD couples survival signals to the cell-intrinsic death machinery"

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs. Images in first, second and third rows correspond to HeLa cells, FBs, and CAFs, respectively.

The cells were first incubated with NPs over a time period of 24\u00a0h followed by another incubation for 24\u00a0h in fresh media to determine the extent of NP retention. b Redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell among two daughter cells during cell division. c Confocal images of HeLa (first row), FBs (second row), and CAFs (third row) displaying distribution of GNPs (first column; marked in red), MT network (second column, marked in green), and merged image (third column) corresponding to GNPs and MTs. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

We propose that the CCL11/CCR3 signaling circuit is a potential target for optimizing therapeutic strategies against HNC.1. IntroductionHead and neck cancer (HNC), the seventh most common cancer worldwide, represents a variety of malignant tumors of the upper aero-digestive tract. More than 60% of patients with HNC present with locally advanced disease, characterized by widely extended tumor and/or multifocal growth with marked local invasion and/or regional lymph node metastases. Emerging studies have shown that tumor cell invasion and migration are key events in tumor progression and metastasis. The prognosis for patients with HNC is poor, even when contemporary multimodal treatments are used; thus, elucidating the underlying mechanisms that promote the invasiveness of cancer and finding a novel treatment strategy are crucial. Tumors are no longer regarded as a bulk of malignant cells, but rather as a complex system consisting of the tumor and its adjacent tumor microenvironment (TME), comprising various cell populations, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), infiltrating immune cells, and the extracellular matrix. The TME plays an important role in cancer development and metastasis. A review of the literature showed that interactions between stromal cells and cancer cells, through various cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators, are associated with tumor invasiveness and treatment resistance. CAFs are the key cell type in the TME and play essential roles in maintaining a favorable milieu and interacting with other stromal components, including immune cells and vessels, by secreting various inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other tumor-promoting factors. Certain CAF-secreted cytokines may mediate immune escape by cross-talk with surrounding immune cells in TME, leading to cancer progression. Moreover, CAFs may alter the immune status within tumors and affect response to current cancer immunotherapy. Chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11), also known as eotaxin-1, is involved in cancer cell migration and invasion. Initially reported to recruit eosinophils to inflammatory sites, predominantly in allergy and asthma, it is also associated with psychiatric disorder, neurodegenerative disease, and infectious disease. Recently, CCL11 was also found to be produced by fibroblast and associated with immune response. Elevated levels of CCL11 have been reported in some cancer types, where they are associated with a poor prognosis. Increased tissue and serum levels of CCL11 inhibit dendritic cell maturation and differentiation in the TME and promote antitumor immunity. CCL11 increases MMP-3 expression via the CCR3-ERK pathway, thereby promoting cell invasion and migration in prostate cancer. Conversely, the loss of CCL11 reduced tumor outgrowth. The functional role of CCL11 in tumor\u2013stromal signaling, particularly TME-mediated aggressiveness, remains controversial. We previously conducted a gene expression microarray to compare the expression profiles of genes encoding protein secreted by CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) and found that, in addition to IL33, another important mediator, CCL11, was overexpressed in CAFs compared to NFs. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate whether CCL11 expressed on CAFs influences HNC promotions and the underlying molecular mechanism. Furthermore, we also studied whether CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3), the main corresponding receptor of CCL11, is directly involved in signal transduction resulting in cancer progression. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cells and ReagentsThe FaDu cell lines (ATCC, catalog number: HTB-43TM) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The TNPC-204 cell line (RRID: CVCL_A5WV) was purchased from the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Cells, including fibroblasts (CAFs and human gingival fibroblasts (NFs)) and HNC cell lines (FaDu and NPC 204), were cultured as previously described. Tumor specimens and adjacent normal tissue were collected from patients with HNC (n = 10, see Table A1). CAFs and NFs were isolated from cancer cell-adjacent fibroblasts and non-cancer gingival tissues, located at least 3 cm away from the tumors obtained from patients with HNC undergoing excision. To determine aggressiveness organotypic forming efficiency, the organotypic with cancer part depth >200 \u03bcm (more than 15 layers) were counted with hematoxylin and eosin stain under light microscope (Leica Microsystems), and the aggressiveness organotypic forming efficiency (\u2030) = scored cancer layer depth/total plating HNC cells. Cells were treated for 6\u2009 h with recombinant CCL11 (rCCL11) protein with doses of 50 \u03bcg/mL (MBS142051, MYBioSource) and then, in a series of experiments, were pre-treated for 1 \u2009h with various enzymatic inhibitors of different signaling pathways: 50\u2009 \u03bcM FR180204 (ERK, inhibitor), 10 \u03bcM SB203580 (p38MAPK inhibitor), or 4 \u03bcM SP600125 (JNK inhibitor). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan (protocol code KSVGH21-CT1-10, 2020/03/26 and KSVGH16-CT6-09, 2018/07/16).2.2. Western Blot AnalysisThe antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Western blotting was performed following a previously described standard protocol. The intensity ratio was showed in Supplementary material S1 and the uncropped Western blots showed in Supplementary Figure S1.2.3. RNA Extraction, Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR), and ELISAWe extracted the total RNA from CAFs and NFs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA); 1 \u03bcg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. To quantify gene expression, we performed qPCR using the StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S2. CAFs and NFs were seeded onto six-well plates at equal density and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then incubated for a further 24 h with serum-free Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM)\u2013F12. CAFs and NFs supernatant CCL11concentrations were measured using the CCL11 (human) ELISA kit (R&D system) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For the sensitivity, the minimum detectable dose of human CCL11 was less than 5 pg/mL. For the specificity, the assay recognized natural and recombinant human CCL11. Cell culture supernatants were prepared at 50 ng/mL in calibrator diluent and were then assayed. Preparations of factors at 50 ng/mL in a mid-range recombinant human CCL11 control were assayed for interference. No significant cross-reactivity or interference was observed. The plates were developed using tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate (TMB, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and the absorbance was recorded using a microplate reader.2.4. In Vitro Migration and Invasion AssaysIn vitro transwell migration and invasion assays were performed. FaDu or NPC204 cells were suspended in culture medium containing 0.5% serum, and then plated in the upper chamber. In the invasion assay, a Matrigel\u2013medium (1:2) mixture was applied onto the membrane of the upper chamber before seeding the cancer cells. Following 12 and 24 h of incubation for the migration and invasion assays, respectively, cells on the upper side of the filter were removed, and migratory or invasive cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde before staining with the hematoxylin. The number of migrated/invaded cells was counted using light microscope. In the co-culture migration/invasion assays, CAFs or NFs were seeded on the outer chamber prior to the FaDu and NPC204 cells and then incubated for 24 h. The growth medium was then replaced with medium with or without an anti-CCL11 antibody. For CCL11-induced migration/invasion assays, rCCL11 protein (10 or 50 ng/mL; MBS142051, MYBioSource) was added to the lower chamber. Then, the assay was performed according to a standard migration/invasion protocol. Three independent experiments were conducted, and data were shown as mean \u00b1 SD. 2.5. Organotypic CultureThree-dimensional, organotypic culture was performed as follows. A collagen I/Matrigel gel was prepared by mixing 8 volumes of collagen I/Matrigel (collagen I:Matrigel = 1:1) with 1 volume each of 10 \u00d7 DMEM and fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing fibroblast cells (5 \u00d7 106). The gel mixture was dispensed into a 12 mm Millicell insert (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA) inside a six-well culture plate. The mixture was allowed to set at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h before cancer cells (2 \u00d7 105) were suspended in growth medium and seeded atop the gel mixture. After incubating for 24 h, cancer cells were exposed to air by removing the medium from the surface. The gel was then fed from underneath with complete media, which was changed daily. After 14 days, cultured tissue was fixed and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis.2.6. Flow CytometryA single-cell suspension containing 1 \u00d7 106 trypsinized cells and spheres was resuspended in 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and stained with fluorescent conjugated antibodies against CD24 (IM1428U, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA), CD44 (A32537, Beckman Coulter, Inc. CA, USA), CD10 (GTX78263, Genetex, Irvine, CA, USA), and GPR77 (MAB10254, R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. For detecting aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) activity, the ALDEFLUOR assay kit (Stem Cell Technologies, Durham, NC, USA) was used. After labeling, cells were washed three times with PBS and subsequently stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- or PE-labeled secondary antibody for 30 min in the dark. Cells were then analyzed on a flow cytometer after washing thrice with PBS. 2.7. Confocal MicroscopyThe colocalization of CCL11 and CCR3 was confirmed using confocal microscopy. The immunofluorescence of CCL11 overexpression FaDu and NPC204 cells was studied using CCL11 and CCR3 primary antibodies. The cells were incubated, respectively, with fluorescent secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 or 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), followed by a nuclear counterstaining with DAPI. Confocal images were visualized at 20\u00d7 magnification using a TissueFAXS Plus System (TissueGnostics, Vienna, Austria) coupled onto a Zeiss\u00ae Axio Imager Z2 microscope (Jena, Germany). Annotated cell borders were identified with the transmission channel.2.8. siRNA KnockdownTo perform gene knockdown, 6 \u00d7 105 cells were seeded in six-well plates, and the siRNA (50 nM) against CCL11 or control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was mixed with TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.2.9. Lentivirus Overexpression of CCL11CCL11 cDNA (Supplementary material S2) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pLenti-GIII-CMV-Luc-2A-Puro vector from Applied Biological Materials (ABM Inc., Richmond, BC, Canada). The viral supernatants were added into FaDu and NPC204 cells to construct stable CCL11 overexpression cell lines. Cells were further treated with puromycin (2 \u03bcg/mL) for one week to select stably transfected cells.2.10. Tissue Microarrays and ImmunohistochemistryClinical cancer samples and patient characteristics were obtained from 104 HNC patients. Tissue microarrays were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. A 2-mm-diameter tissue core was punched out from the invasive front of each patient\u2019s block and transplanted onto a recipient block. Immunohistochemical staining was performed. Briefly, after rehydration and microwave antigen retrieval, monoclonal antibodies against human CCL11 and CCR3 were applied, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Staining intensity was scored as follows: no staining (score 0), faint staining (score 1), moderate staining (score 2), and strong staining (score 3). Total scores were calculated using the following formula: Total score = staining intensity score \u00d7 percentage of staining distribution.2.11. Statistical AnalysisDensitometry was used to measure the fold-change between and among conditions. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to test statistics when the number of samples/tests (N) was less than ten. A Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was used to test associations between CCL11 and CCR3 expression, and the clinical outcome. The univariable Cox proportional-hazards model was used to determine the potential prognostic factors for overall survival. Factors with p < 0.1 in the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable analysis. A Student\u2019s t test was used to identify significant differences between experimental groups with n > 10 and a normal distribution profile. All statistical analyses were conducted on SPSS software v. 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), with a value of p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. 3. Results3.1. Higher Levels of CCL11 Are Found in CAFs Than in NFsA panel of CAFs and NFs was generated with specimens from 10 patients with HNC (see Table A1). CAF and NF samples were dissected, isolated, and prepared from HNC patients who underwent surgical resection. Morphological observations demonstrated that CAFs present with more cytoplasmic protrusions than the relatively uniform NFs (Figure 1a). A higher expression level of vimentin and \u03b1-SMA was found in CAFs than in NFs, determined using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Figure 1b). Flow cytometric analysis showed a marked increase in the activity of CD10 and GPR77 (Figure 1c), which were characterized as essential cell surface markers of a CAF subset correlated with chemo-resistance and poor survival. Furthermore, we performed a gene expression microarray study to compare their expression profiles. We focused on a group of secreted proteins, including chemokine-related and/or cytokine-associated genes, which were significantly up- or down-regulated (\u22654-fold) in CAFs compared to NFs. Among these, CCL11 expression was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (Figure 1d); this finding was also confirmed by RT-PCR and ELISA analysis (Figure 1e). Western blot analysis also showed CCL11 overexpression in CAF, compared with that in NF in cell lysates (Figure 1f). Moreover, administration of CAF-conditioned medium (CAF-CM) to FaDu and NPC204 cells, compared to NF-conditioned medium (NF-CM), induced a higher CCL11 expression (Figure 1g). Collectively, these results showed that CCL11 was overexpressed in CAFs, implicating that CCL11 was associated with CAF-induced cancer behaviors.3.2. CAF-Induced CCL11 Increases the Ability of Migration and Invasion of HNC Cells and Promotes Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)CCL11 overexpression in the CAF-culture medium suggests that CCL11 might be critical for CAF-induced cancer aggressiveness. FaDu and NPC204 cells cultured with medium containing CAF-induced CCL11 showed greater abilities of migration and invasion. Furthermore, migration and invasion assays using a CCL11-neutralizing antibody and rCCL11 were performed to confirm the functional role of CAF-mediated CCL11 (Figure 2a). The migration ability of FaDu and NPC204 cells increased in rCCL11-treated cancer cells (Figure 2a, upper panel); the results of the Transwell invasion assay showed a similar effect on the cell invasion ability of FaDu and NPC204 cells (Figure 2a, lower panel). Treating cells with an anti-CCL11 antibody neutralized its activity and attenuated the aggressive phenotype.According to the results of the Transwell migration assay, migration ability increased 8\u20139-fold in FaDu and NPC204 cells cultured with CAF-CM, compared to those cultured in control medium. Increased invasiveness was also observed following CAF-CM treatment of FaDu and NPC204 cells. Furthermore, we used a three-dimensional organotypic culture system, a co-culture model mimicking the in vivo TME, to investigate the interactions, particularly invasion, between CAFs and cancer cells. Using the three-dimensional organotypic raft culture technique, we tested whether clinically isolated CAFs could induce a more aggressive phenotype and behavior in cancer cells. To determine whether the CAFs and NFs recapitulate the clinical features of original tumors, several experiments were conducted. To clarify whether CAFs promote the aggressiveness organotypic forming ability, CAF and NF cells were sorted out and co-cultured with cancer cells. The results showed that after co-culture with CAFs, the aggressiveness organotypic forming efficiency of CAFs was largely increased, while the NFs cells were unaltered, indicating that co-culture with CAFs may promote the invasive ability of CAFs. (see Table A1). FaDu and NPC204 cell infiltration was clearly observed in the section of the matrix layer containing embedded CAFs, supporting the role of CAFs in the aggressiveness of HNC. Among the four groups tested, the two groups with CAFs and NF+CCL11 showed a marked increase in invasiveness. Adding anti-CCL11 antibody reversed the invasion ability (Figure 2b). Overall, the above results showed that CAFs mediated a paracrine effect by means of CCL11 on cancer cells, thereby promoting cancer invasiveness. EMT encompasses dynamic changes in the cellular organization of epithelial-to-mesenchymal phenotypes, leading to increased cell migration and invasion; it is an important mechanism for cancer aggressiveness. We examined whether CAF-induced CCL11 promoted cancer cell aggressiveness by inducing EMT. First, we treated cells with a CAF or NF conditioned medium. Western blot analysis showed decreased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased expression of the mesenchymal marker fibronectin; EMT regulators (Twist and Snail) were also overexpressed (Figure 2c). Furthermore, rCCL11 treatment also induced changes in EMT markers/regulators, resulting in a more mesenchymal phenotype. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are capable of degrading type IV collagen, the most abundant component of the basement membrane. Degradation of the basement membrane is an essential step for the metastatic progression of most cancers. Treating FaDu and NPC204 cells with rCCL11 induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that rCCL11 plays a critical role in the promotion of cancer aggressiveness as a result of CAFs inducing an EMT-like conversion.3.3. CCL11 Contributes to the Induction of Sphere Formation, Enhanced Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) Properties, and Drug ResistanceTo understand the CCL11-mediated crosstalk between cancer cells and CAFs at the molecular level, we investigated if the paracrine effects of CCL11 effect the expression of the CSC-like properties of HNCs. The effects of CAF-induced CCL11 on the ability of sphere formation, the expression of CSC-like properties, and the expression of CSC-representative markers were first examined. A non-adhesive sphere culture system was used, and the result showed that HNC cell lines exposed to rCCL11 and CAFs-conditioned medium initially generated immature, floating spheroids in the first 3\u20135 days, which further gradually transformed into well-formed spheres at day 7. However, control cells yielded only an irregular small cell mass without the spheroid appearance (Figure 3a). Flow cytometric analysis showed significantly higher CD44/CD24 and CD133 in HNC cells exposed to rCCL11, compared with control HNC cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 3b). Moreover, the fluorescence level of ALDH1 obtained through FACS analysis was higher following treatment with rCCL11 in both HNC cells (Figure 3c). Western blot analysis showed that other CSC-representative markers, including OCT4, Nanog, and Sox-2, were also overexpressed in HNC cells exposed to CCL11 compared to control HNC cells. Drug resistance-related gene expression was also tested in HNC cells. Western blot analysis showed that CCL11 was also involved in ABCG-2 and MDR-1 upregulation (Figure 3d). Chemoresistance treated with Cisplatin was also significantly enhanced in both FaDu and NPC204 cells exposed to rCCL11 (Figure 3e). Collectively, these results indicate that cells exposed to CCL11 through paracrine signaling enhance representative CSC properties and drug resistance.3.4. Expression of CCL11 and Its Receptor, CCR3, in HNC Cells Is Closely Associated with Clinical Patient SurvivalCCR3 is reported to be a specific receptor for CCL11; the interaction of CCL11/CCR3 directly induced cell survival and proliferation. Confocal microscopy analysis showed the cellular co-localization of CCL11 and CCR3 in HNC tumor cells (Figure 4a). This polarized co-localization of CCL11/CCR3 signaling suggests evidence of a chemotactic effect that might be important for sensing the environment and guiding migration in HNC cells. Collectively, these findings supported our hypothesis that CCL11 would stimulate the chemotactic migration of HNC cells. Cloned CCL11-overexpressed FaDu and NPC204 cells were first established. Western blot analysis showed that the CCL11-overexpressed FaDu and NPC204 cells presented higher expression level of CCL11, CCR3, MMP2, and MMP9. These proteins were reversed by treatment of the CCL11 siRNA and CCR3 antibody (Figure 4b). To identify the downstream pathway involved in CCL11/CCR3 signaling, we examined the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK. Western blot analysis showed high expression of p38 MAPK and ERK, rather than JNK, in CCL11-overexpressed FaDu and NPC204 cells, which were further suppressed after treatment of their individual inhibitors (Figure 4c). This result indicates that the CCL11/CCR3 downstream pathway was involved in p38 MAPK and ERK, resulting in an enhanced ability of invasion and migration. Immunohistochemical staining of CCL11 was observed in the putative area where CAFs and tumor from a representative case delineated the same area, and distribution of CCR3 investigated in the same area showed that both expressions coexisted (Figure 4d). Furthermore, we validated the role of CCL11 and CCR3 expression on the prognosis of patients with HNC using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays of clinical samples. The patient characteristics and clinical parameters of the 104 patients whose samples were used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S3, based on the expression of CCL11 and CCR3. In survival analysis, higher CCL11 expression is associated with lower 5-year overall survival (Figure 4e, 62.4% vs. 79.1%, p = 0.003). For CCR3, higher expression was also significantly associated with lower 5-year overall survival (Figure 4e, 62.3% vs. 74.4%, p = 0.044). To identify independent prognostic factors for overall survival, we conducted univariable and multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional-hazards model. The results are shown in Supplementary Table S4. In univariable analysis for possible prognostic factors, T stage (T1-2 vs. T3-4), expression of CCR3, expression of CCL11, and co-expression of CCL11 and CCR3 were significantly associated with overall survival in patients with HNC. In multivariable analysis, only T stage, expression of CCL, and co-expression of CCL11 and CCR3 were independent prognostic factors for overall survival. Thus, the most important prognostic factors were T stage and expression of CCL11. When patients had both T3-4 disease and overexpression of CCL11, the 5-year survival was only 46.2%; significantly lower than the other three subgroups (p < 0.001, Supplementary Figure S2). 4. DiscussionCancer cells inhabit a complex microenvironment in vivo, comprising non-cancer cells and tumor stroma, each of which contributes to cancer development and progression. Modulation of the TME, apart from altering the hemostasis cascade, is regarded as being closely associated with cancer behaviors. The presence of active CAFs around cancer cell nests is associated with poorer survival in solid cancers, such as cancers of the esophagus, prostate, colon, and breast. However, the underlying molecular mechanism and role of CAFs in TME remain unknown. CCL11 has been reported as a diagnostic or prognostic marker in cancers. However, other than studies on allergic responses or immunological function involving CCL11, there is a lack of studies showing its role in other diseases, especially HNC. Here, we provide a clear step-by-step demonstration of CCL11 as a critical mediator in CAF-induced cancer invasiveness. We first isolated and cultured the NFs and CAFs from the tissue of patients receiving head and neck surgery at our institute, because using patient-derived fibroblasts may mimic clinical situations. CAFs in the TME are thought to be transformed from NFs. We observed a progressive transition from NFs to CAFs, showing functional and morphological alterations between them. As reported previously, CAFs in primary culture displayed a higher expression of CD10 and GPR77 than NFs, suggesting that these molecules help the differentiation of CAFs from NFs. Moreover, CAFs displayed more peculiar cytoplasmic protrusions than NFs, and they also displayed an increased ability to induce HNC cells to become more aggressive compared to NFs. Induction of invasion was markedly increased by CAF-induced CCL11 via the paracrine effect. In this study, we used an organotypic culture system to investigate the interactions between CAFs and cancer cells. As seen in Figure 2, FaDu and NPC204 cell infiltration was clearly observed in the section of the matrix layer containing embedded CAFs, supporting the role of CAFs and their secretions in enhancing HNC aggressiveness. We performed a gene expression microarray to examine the differences in the expression profiles of cytokines and chemokines between CAFs and NFs, showing a marked increase in CCL11 expression in CAFs compared to NFs.This intriguing and novel finding was validated in the present study by showing that the functional CAF-induced CCL11 plays a driving role in cancer behaviors via induction of EMT and enhancing CSC-like properties. Treatment with rCCL11 induced the EMT phenotype in our cells, suggesting that CCL11 is a novel mediator in CAF-induced cancer aggressiveness through the induction of EMT. Furthermore, the CSC representative marker expression, sphere-forming ability, and chemo-resistance with drug-resistant gene upregulation (ABCG2 and MDR-1) was observed in HNC cells exposed to rCCL11. In our result, we verified the existence of the main corresponding receptor of CCL11, CCR3, that is directly involved in signaling transduction and cancer progression by confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry. CAF-induced CCL11 chemotactically migrated and interacted with CCR3 situated on HNC cells, reflecting the existence of a CCL11/CCR3 signaling axis or circuit. We also validated that the CCL11/CCR3 downstream pathway strongly associated with p38 MAPK and ERK signaling cascade. Furthermore, to examine the clinical significance of the expression of CCL11 and CCR3, we immunohistochemically analyzed tissue samples from 104 representative patients with HNC for whom clinical information was available. We constructed a tissue microarray for analysis of a relatively large histopathological sample size. It showed that individual expression of CCL11 or CCR3, as well as co-expression of both CCL11 and CCR3, was significantly correlated with poor overall survival. These results suggested that CCL11 might be a potential prognostic biomarker in HNC. The tumor stroma offers an attractive target for cancer therapeutics and may provide a new route for treatment intervention. The results of our present study directly link the most two important hallmark events of cancer behavior, invasion and microenvironment. We demonstrated the role of CCL11 in the CAF-promoted aggressiveness of cancer cells, as well as the mechanisms involved in the interactions between cancer cells and fibroblasts. Through CCL11, CAFs interact and crosstalk with cancer cells, eventually leading to tumor progression. Additionally, we verified that CCL11 expression from surrounding CAFs directly affects the tumor behavior and promotes its aggressiveness by targeting CCR3. This effect may subsequently induce self-secretion of CCL11 from the tumor, leading to a vicious cycle of spontaneous CCL11/CCR3 circuit activity, which is now shown to be correlated closely with invasive behavior and clinical outcomes in patients with HNC. This kind of complex crosstalk with molecular communications proceeds and conducts via both paracrine and autocrine signaling between CAFs and the tumor. The diagrammatic illustrations (Figure 5) of three sequential steps demonstrate our proposal to explain the major mechanism of how CAF-induced CCL11/CCR3 signaling in TME contributes to cancer behavior.5. ConclusionsOur results provide an insight into the mechanisms underlying the interaction between CAF and HNC cells via the paracrine effect of CAF-induced CCL11. Further work on the genome sequencing of CAFs and the patient-derived tumor explant model is warranted on the basis of clinical translation. For precision medicine-based clinical practice, modulating the TME by targeting the CCL11/CCR3 signaling circuit may attenuate the aggressiveness of cancer cells and offer a novel therapeutic strategy to improve the prognosis in patients with HNC.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at .

(c) Representative blots of the EMT-associated markers in FaDu and NPC204 cells, as observed upon Western blotting analysis in five groups, showed that treatment with CAF-conditioned medium or the application of rCCL11 decreased the expression of epithelial-type markers (E-cadherin), and increased the expression of mesenchymal-type markers (fibronectin) and EMT regulators (Snail and Twist). In addition, increased expression of invasion-related MMP2 and MMP9 was also seen in those two groups, compared with other groups.

Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD.Comparative analysis of induction of CSC properties and drug resistance in HNC cells associated with CCL11. (a) Four groups were classified for comparative analysis of the ability of sphere formation. Increased ability of sphere formation in two test groups of HNC cells exposed to a CAF medium and the group with treatment of rCCL11 was noted. (b) Flow cytometric analysis showed a significant increase in CD44 and CD44/CD24, as well as in CD133 in HNC cells exposed to rCCL11, compared to control HNC cells (p < 0.05). (c) Flow cytometric analysis showed a marked increase in ALDH-1 activity in HNC cells exposed to rCCL11 compared to control HNC cells. (d) Western blot analysis showed that CSC-representative markers, Oct-4, Nanog, and Sox-2, were also overexpressed in addition to the increased expression of two important drug resistance genes, ABCG-2 and MDR-1, in HNC cells exposed to rCCL11. (e) Treatment with Cisplatin at 24 h showed a significant increase in chemoresistance in both FaDu and NPC204 cells exposed to rCCL11 compared with control HNC cells. The asterisk indicates a significant difference (*: p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01) between experimental and control groups.CCL11 and CCR3 expression with associated signal pathway in HNC cell lines and their correlation to clinical outcomes in 104 HNC patients. (a) Confocal microscopic images showed CCL11 (green) localized to both cell and nuclear membranes, while CCR3 (red) localized only to the cell membrane in FaDu cells; CCL11 and CCR3 co-localized at the cell membrane (yellow). In NPC204 cells, CCL11 (green) and CCR3 (red) were found to co-localize at protrusions polarized to the cells (yellow). (b) Using the crisp technique, higher expression of CCR3, MMP2, and MMP3 was found in over-expressed CCL11 cloned-FaDu and NPC204 cells. Cloned CCL11-overexpressed cells were abolished by adding eotaxin siRNA or CCR3 antibody, which reversed the expression of CCR3 and invasion-related MMP2 and MMP9. (c) Higher phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK and ERK were found in cloned CCL11-overexpressed FaDu and NPC204 cells and were reversed by treatment of the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) and ERK inhibitor (FR180204), respectively. The phosphorylation level of JNK was kept in low condition before and after treatment of the JNK inhibitor (SP600125). (d) Photomicrographs of immunohistochemical staining from tissue microarray showing CCL11 and CCR3 expression in three different representative groups of HNC patients (magnification, \u00d7200). (e) Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis of patients showed that overexpression of CCL11 and CCR3 were statistically associated with poor overall survival).The diagrammatic illustration demonstrates the major mechanism that CAFs secreting CCL11 promotes HNC cell migration and invasion and induces properties of drug resistance and stemness, shown as follows. CAFs in TME secret CCL11 binding to the CCR3 receptors on HNC cells via the paracrine effect. The signal induces overexpression of transcriptional factors, such as Snail and Twist, which regulate EMT and are also responsible for self-induction of CCL11 in an autocrine fashion. As a result, CCL11, via paracrine or autocrine signaling when targeting CCR3 receptors, play a functional role in the induction of EMT and CSC properties, for further tumor progression."

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 3The 4T1-GFP cell line was used to determine whether the 14+ MECs were derived from the expansion of transplanted 4T1 cells. The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

As much as 50% or more of tumor bulk consists of non-parenchymal cells often referred to as the tumor microenvironment, including immune cells, cells of the microvasculature, and fibroblasts. Cells of the tumor parenchyma and stroma engage in extensive cross-talk, and the composition of the stroma and the nature of tumor stromal interactions change over time with tumor progression. Tumor-stroma cross-talk influences tumor growth by regulating angiogenesis, suppressing or subverting host immune responses, modulating extracellular matrix, and secreting signaling molecules which then in turn act on cells to further alter cell physiology and to change the composition of the cellular and acellular tumor microenvironment.Fibroblasts are ubiquitous stromal cells which influence other cells through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors. The response of tumor parenchymal cells to fibroblasts depends on many factors, including the nature and extent of the oncogenic lesions in the tumor cells, and the age and activation state of the fibroblasts.While fibroblasts can have tumor suppressing activity the phenotype of the fibroblast changes to a tumor promoting state as carcinogenesis progresses. This process occurs in two stages, generating first reversibly \u201cprimed\u201d and then irreversibly modified fibroblasts with tumor-promoting properties. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) have properties distinct from normal fibroblasts and actively promote tumorigenesis in mouse models of prostate and breast cancer. Typically CAFs have an activated phenotype, expressing smooth muscle actin and showing increased motility. CAFs secrete tumor promoting effectors such as SDF-1, HGF, and TGF-\u03b2 into the tumor microenvironment, and they overproduce extracellular matrix, which contributes to tumor rigidity and an altered signaling context thus further promoting tumor progression. Thus, the phenotype of local fibroblasts can persistently be altered by complex reciprocal parenchymal-stromal interactions that occur during cancer progression.TGF-\u03b2s are pleiotropic growth factors that play important roles in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis. Cells release latent TGF-\u03b2 into the microenvironment that upon activation binds to specific serine-threonine kinase receptors. A heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor and the type I TGF-\u03b2 receptor (ALK5) then activates intracellular signaling cascades that include the canonical Smad2/3 signaling path and additional pathways such as TAK1-mediated p38- or JNK signaling. Dysregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling has been implicated in the carcinogenic process in many organs. In the course of cancer progression, TGF-\u03b2s frequently switch from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoting role. In the embryo, expression of TGF-\u03b2 is frequently seen at sites where critical mesenchymal-epithelial interactions occur, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2s may act as an important messenger between these two compartments. In support of such a role, genetic loss of response to TGF-\u03b2 in fibroblasts is associated with aberrant expression of growth factors and cytokines by the fibroblasts and results in the development of premalignant and malignant lesions in several overlying epithelia in stomach, prostate and breast. However, forced overexpression of TGF-\u03b2 primes fibroblasts to promote the outgrowth of initiated human breast epithelial cells. These genetic approaches imply the existence of very delicately balanced TGF-\u03b2-based homeostatic interactions between fibroblasts and the epithelial parenchyma.When a cancer cell metastasizes, it first will be exposed to CAFs in the immediate tumor microenvironment and then to normal fibroblasts as it traverses the underlying connective tissue towards the bloodstream. Here, we have asked whether the transient interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can induce phenotypic changes in the tumor cell that then affect its malignant properties. We provide evidence that such an interaction induces the secretion and/or activation of endogenous TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts, which can enhance the malignant behavior of the tumor cells in vivo.ResultsMedium Conditioned by Cocultures of Fibroblasts and Tumor Cells Induces Cell Scattering in Tumor CellsWe investigated the crosstalk between human metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF10CA1a hereafter referred to as CA1a) and fibroblasts (DF) in a two-dimensional coculture system. Cocultures of CA1a and DF formed an organized structure of tumor cell islets that were surrounded by elongated fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Using CA1a cells and DF that were stably infected to report activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by expression of fluorescent protein, we found that TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated in both tumor and stromal cells in the cocultures, as compared to much lower levels of activation in the homotypic cultures (Fig. 1A). This observation suggested that cocultures might exhibit emergent properties that were not present in the homotypic cultures. To address the effect of coculturing on secreted components of the tumor microenvironment, we used conditioned media from 4 d old homotypic cultures or cocultures to stimulate CA1a cells that had not been previously exposed to any conditioned media. In scratch assays medium conditioned by cocultures (CoCM) significantly accelerated closure of the cell-cleared area as compared to medium conditioned by tumor cells (TuCM), fibroblasts alone (FbCM), or unconditioned control medium (medium) (Fig. 1B,C). A similar result was seen when we treated tumor cells that had been plated as a tight colony and assessed migration of cells out of the colony (dot assay). This assay format more closely mimics the migration of tumor cells out of a tumor into the surrounding environment, and eliminates the wounding aspect of the scratch assay. In dot assays CoCM caused scattering of tumor cells from the edges of the colony, whereas colonies treated with homotypic media retained a defined closed edge (Fig. 1B). While CoCM increased migration of CA1a cells, proliferation of CA1a cells was unaffected by treatment with CM (Fig. S1A). At the cellular level, CoCM caused translocation of E-cadherin to the cytoplasm of CA1a cells whereas E-cadherin remained localized at the cell membrane of CA1a cells stimulated with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 1B, D). Taken together, these data suggest that coculture of tumor cells with fibroblasts causes secretion of a soluble factor that increases cell scattering and migration of tumor cells.Cocultures of breast cancer cells are well organized and increase motility of tumor cells.\nA.\nUpper panel. Human breast cancer cells (CA1a) and mouse dermal fibroblasts (DF) form a well organized 2D coculture where fibroblast streaks surround tumor cell islets. Middle panel. Use of fibroblasts and CA1a cells that report Smad3 dependent TGF-\u03b2 signaling by expression of RFP and GFP, respectively, demonstrates that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both cell types is increased in cocultures as compared to the homotypic cultures. Bottom Panel. Outline of the tumor cell and fibroblast compartments of the images shown in the middle panel. B. Medium conditioned by cocultures (CoCM) as compared to medium from homotypic fibroblast (FbCM) and tumor cell (TuCM) cultures increases cell migration and cell scattering in scratch assays (24 h) and dot assays (4 d), and induces cytoplasmic localization of E-cadherin as visualized by confocal microscopy (60 min). C. Influence of CoCM on closure of in vitro wounds (\u201cscratch assay\u201d). Cells were plated to confluence, mitosis inhibited by preincubation with mitomycin, and cells then stimulated with conditioned media. CoCM causes significantly faster closure of scratches as compared to all other conditioned media (scratch width after 24 h, n\u200a=\u200a8 samples/group, ANOVA/Bonferroni; p<0.0001). D. Quantification of E-cadherin related immunofluorescence in CA1a cells treated with CM (Fig. 1B). Membranes and cytoplasm of cells were gated separately and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of membrane and cytoplasmic signal were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (Kruskal-Wallis test/Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, p\u200a=\u200a0.0052).Cell Scattering Induced by Coculture Conditioned Medium Depends on Active TGF-\u03b2 Synthesized by FibroblastsCell scattering can be induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors, and so we tested the effect of candidate factors in the dot assay. Only TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml, Fig. 2A) but not other growth factors such as EGF (Fig. 2A, 25 ng/ml to 250 ng/ml), TNF-\u03b1 (1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml), HGF (5 ng/ml to 20 ng/ml), latency associated protein (LAP, 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml) or activin A (0.1 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml), induced scattering of CA1a cells in dot assays. To address whether endogenous TGF-\u03b2 might be the factor in CoCM that induces scattering, we used two different Smad-reporter systems to analyze if CA1a cells respond to TGF-\u03b2 in the CM and to sensitively report on the presence of active TGF-\u03b2 in the conditioned media. CoCM induced higher Smad3- and Smad2-mediated luciferase activity than did TuCM, FbCM, or medium, demonstrating that CoCM derived TGF-\u03b2 increases TGF-\u03b2 signaling in tumor cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, CoCM contained higher levels of active TGF-\u03b2 (194\u00b139 pg/ml) than the other conditioned media (TuCM: 94\u00b16 pg/ml, FbCM: 106\u00b122 pg/ml, medium: 0 pg/ml, Fig. 2C) as assessed by activation of a PAI-luciferase reporter activity in CCL64 cells.TGF-\u03b2 signaling induces scattering of CA1a cells.\nA. Exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and fibroblast-released TGF-\u03b2 induces cell scattering in dot assays. Cells were plated into dot assays, incubated over night, and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml), EGF (100 ng/ml), or vehicle (Control) for 4 d. Use of CoCM that was derived from cocultures of CA1a cells and TGF\u03b21 knockout fibroblasts (CoCM(KO)) did not stimulate cell scattering while conditioned medium from cocultures employing TGF-\u03b21 wildtype fibroblasts (CoCM(WT)) did induce cell scattering. B. CoCM as compared to TuCM and FbCM induces higher levels of CAGA (Smad3) and ARE (Smad2) mediated luciferase activity in CA1a cells (n\u200a=\u200a3, ANOVA/Dunnett's Multiple Comparison, p\u200a=\u200a0.0002 (ARE) and p<0.0001 (CAGA)). C. CoCM contains higher levels of TGF-\u03b2 than TuCM and FbCM. CCL-64 cells were stimulated with CM overnight and PAI-driven luciferase activity was measured. D. Scattering of CA1a cells is induced by addition of 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 to medium. Cells were plated into dot assays, incubated overnight, and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (0.2 ng/ml) or vehicle for 4 d.We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 can induce scattering of CA1a cells in concentrations similar to those secreted by cocultures into the CoCM. To do this we stimulated CA1a with medium containing 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 and observed that that this low level of TGF-\u03b2 was sufficient to induce tumor cell scattering (Fig. 2D). Likewise, Smad3 driven GFP expression of the CAGA\u223cGFP reporter was increased by stimulation of CA1a cells with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 (Fig. S2A). These results indicate that the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 that is secreted by cocultures into the culture medium (CoCM) is sufficient to stimulate cell scattering of CA1a cells.To ask whether this effect was limited to CA1a cells or was more universal we stimulated MCF-7 cells and T47D cells which form adherent cell colonies in culture with 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 or CoCM. Both, 0.2 ng/ml exogenous TGF-\u03b2 and CoCM, were capable of inducing scattering of MCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. S3), indicating that low concentrations of TGF-\u03b2 as found in CoCM can increase motility of several breast cancer cell lines.Since tumor cells as well as fibroblasts can secrete TGF-\u03b2, we went on to identify the source of TGF-\u03b2 in our coculture system. While medium obtained from cocultures of CA1a cells with embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild type mice stimulated scattering of CA1a cells, coculture medium from CA1a cells with embryonic fibroblasts derived from TGF-\u03b21-null mice did not induce scattering of CA1a cells (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data suggest that coculture of tumor cells with fibroblasts induces production or activation of TGF-\u03b21 by fibroblasts that then stimulates scattering of the tumor cells.CoCM Stimulates Canonical and Noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 Signaling in CA1a CellsThe TGF-\u03b2 signaling network includes canonical signaling via Smad2/3 as well as non-canonical signaling cascades. Non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling via MAPK pathways can be mediated by TAK1 that then activates JNK- and p38-signaling (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis showed that Smad2, Smad3 and TAK1 were phosphorylated to a greater extent by stimulation of CA1a cells with CoCM than by stimulation with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 3A), indicating activation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling by CoCM. On a cellular level, CoCM induced nuclear translocation of Smad2/3in CA1a cells as demonstrated by immunostaining (Fig. 3B,C). This and the induction of Smad2 and Smad3 dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2B) further demonstrate that CoCM activates canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells. Similarly, immunofluorescence showed significantly increased levels of proteins of the p38 signaling cascade (phospho-p38, phospho-ATF-2, and phospho-MAPKAPK2) and of phospho-JNK in CA1a cells stimulated with CoCM as compared to CA1a cells stimulated with TuCM or FbCM (Fig. 4A,B). These data demonstrate that canonical and non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades are activated upon stimulation of CA1a with CoCM.CoCM activates Smad2/3-signaling and the MAPK signaling cascades p38 and JNK in CA1a cells suggesting activation of canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling by CoCM derived TGF-\u03b2.\nA. TGF-\u03b2 activates canonical signaling via Smad2/3 and non-canonical signaling via TAK-1 relayed JNK- and p38 signaling cascades. CoCM stimulated both, phosphorylation of TAK1, and phosphorylation of Smad2/Smad3. Cells were incubated with CoCM for 30 min (pTAK1) or 60 min (pSmad2, pSmad3). B. CoCM as compared to TuCM and FbCM induces nuclear localization of Smad2/3 within 60 min, indicating activation of canonical Smad signaling upon stimulation with CoCM. C. Quantification of Smad2/3 mediated immunofluorescence in CM treated CA1a cells (Fig. 2B). Nuclei and cytoplasm of cells were gated separately and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (ANOVA/Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001, n\u200a=\u200anumber of cells analyzed).CoCM activates the MAPK signaling cascades p38 and JNK signaling in CA1a.\nA. Stimulation of CA1a cells with CoCM as compared to FbCM and TuCM for 60 min increases levels of phospho-p38 (pp38), pATF-2, pMAPKAPK-2, and pJNK as visualized by fluorescence microscopy, indicating that CoCM activates these non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades. For quantification of pp38-, pATF-2-, pMAPKAPK2- and pJNK mediated immunofluorescence cells were gated and average signal intensity was determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (Kruskal-Wallis test/Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001 [pp38], p<0.0001 [pATF-2], p<0.0001 [pMAPKAPK2], p<0.00001 [pJNK]). 30 to 40 cells were analyzed per group. B. Inhibitors were added to cultures 30 min prior to stimulating CA1a cells with CoCM for 60 min. E-cadherin was visualized by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. For quantification of E-cadherin mediated the cell membrane and the cytoplasm were gated for each cell and average signal intensities were determined using ImageJ. Ratios of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism (ANOVA/Dunnetts's Multiple Comparison Test, p<0.0001. n \u200a=\u200a number of cells analyzed in each group.Likewise, medium containing 0.2 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2 induced increased levels of pSmad2, pTAK1, MKK3/6, pJNK, pp38, pATF-2, and pMAPKAPK2 in Western blotting (Fig. S2B), indicating that the TGF-\u03b2 concentration that is found in CoCM (0.2 ng/ml) can not only stimulate cell scattering (Fig. 2D), but also is sufficient to activate canonical and non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades in CA1a cells.We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 signaling is necessary for CoCM induced cell scattering and blocked ALK5, JNK, and p38 signaling during stimulation of CA1a with CoCM. The ALK5 inhibitor SB431542, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 4B) all abolished tumor cell scattering induced by CoCM. On a cellular level, those same inhibitors reduced cytoplasmic translocation of E-cadherin induced by CoCM (Fig. 4B), again indicating that both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades are involved in CoCM induced cell scattering. Hence, CoCM stimulates tumor cell scattering via activation of both canonical and noncanonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling.CoCM Causes Increased Tumor Growth and Metastasis In Vivo Cell migration and cell scattering are in vitro correlates of increased tumor cell malignancy. Thus, we next asked if the transient in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM alters in vivo tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of CA1a cells. First we treated CA1a cells with CoCM for 4 d in vitro, and then we washed, trypsinized, and injected cells into the mammary fat pads of SCID mice (Fig. 5A). The ex vivo pretreatment of CA1a cells with CoCM significantly accelerated primary tumor growth at the orthotopic site when compared to CA1a cells treated with TuCM, FbCM or medium alone (Fig. 5B).CoCM increases tumorigenicity and expands the metastatic pattern of CA1a cells.\nA. Experimental design of orthotopic implantation- and tail vein injection models. CA1a cells were pre-treated ex vitro with CM for 4 days, trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in DPBS. Orthotopic Implantation Model. 4\u00d7104 cells in 50 \u00b5l DPBS were bilaterally injected into the axillary mammary fat pads of female SCID mice (15 animals or 30 tumor inoculation sites/group). Tumor size was assessed thrice weekly using calipers. Estimated tumor volumes were calculated by the formula (S\u00d7S\u00d7L)\u00d70.52, where S and L are the short and long dimensions, respectively. Tail Vein Injection Model. 2\u00d7105 cells in 100 \u00b5l DPBS were injected into the tail vein of female NOD SCID mice, and animals were monitored twice weekly for signs of metastasis. B.\nEx vivo pre-treatment of CA1a cells with CoCM accelerates growth of orthotopic xenograft tumors in vivo. The axillary mammary fat pads of female SCID mice were bilaterally inoculated with CA1a cells that were pre-treated with CM (15 animals or 30 tumor inoculation sites/group). Tumor volumes at day 23 were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. Kruskal Wallis test/Dunn's multiple comparison; p<0.001; CoCM vs TuCM: ***, CoCM vs FbCM: **, CoCM vs medium: ***, TuCM vs FbCM: N.S., TuCM vs medium: N.S., FbCM vs medium: N.S.. Representative of 2 independent experiments. C.\nEx vivo pre-treatment of CA1a cells with CoCM results in extrapulmonary metastases in tail vein injection assays. CA1a cells were incubated with conditioned media for 4 days and injected into the tail vein of female NOD SCID mice. While all animals developed lung metastases, only animals injected with CoCM treated CA1a cells developed extrapulmonary tumors. Extrapulmonary tumor growth was suppressed when TGF-\u03b2 signaling was inhibited by the ALK 5 inhibitor SB431542 during exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM. Animals receiving CoCM pre-treated cells had significantly higher occurrence of extrapulmonary tumors than all other groups (Chi Square Test, tail vein injection #1: p\u200a=\u200a0.0002; tail vein injection #2: p\u200a=\u200a0.0085). D. Functional TGF-\u03b2 signaling of tumor cells is required for CoCM induced formation of extrapulmonary metastases. Blocking of ALK5 mediated TGF-\u03b2 signaling by the ALK5-inhibitor SB435142 during in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM inhibited metastases and significantly increased survival time of animals in vivo (median survival: CoCM: 62 days (n\u200a=\u200a13 animals), SB431542: 96 days (n\u200a=\u200a14 animals), Kaplan Maier Analysis, p<0.0001).The metastatic potential of CoCM treated cells was explored by injection into the tail vein of NOD SCID mice because the CA1a cell line does not metastasize efficiently from the orthotopic site. Additionally this assay format allows metastatic efficiency to be assessed independently of any effect of the experimental intervention on tumor development at the primary site. Mice in all experimental groups developed metastatic colonies of CA1a cells in the lung (Fig. 5C) and no differences of the number of lung colonies were found between the CoCM- and other treatment groups at day 40 after injections of tumor cells (Fig. S4); however, we observed a fairly high frequency of tumor colonization at extrapulmonary sites exclusively in animals that were injected with tumor cells that had been pre-treated with CoCM (Fig. 5C). Extrapulmonary tumors were seen at subcutaneous sites in the proximity of axillary and inguinal mammary fat pads, and in the thoracic wall. Histologically, subcutaneous metastatic tumors resembled the xenografted primary tumors (Fig. 6A, B).CoCM expands the metastatic pattern of CA1a cells and induces sustained TGF-\u03b2 signaling via pSmad2.\nA. Extrapulmonary tumors formed by CoCM pre-treated CA1a cells after tail vein injection were highly invasive. Extrapulmonary tumors were observed in the subcutaneously, often in the proximity to mammary fat pads (arrows indicate a normal mammary duct, hematoxylin-eosin staining). B. Xenograft tumors and extrapulmonary metastatic tumors derived from CoCM pre-treated cells have higher levels of nuclear pSmad2 than xenograft tumors derived from medium pre-treated CA1a cells as shown by immunostaining. Levels of pSmad2 in xenograft and metastatic tumors were higher in CA1a cells invading the surrounding tissue (arrows) as compared to tumor cells in the center of tumors. The negative control was obtained by omitting the primary antibody. C. Nuclear pSmad2 is increased in tumor cells at the tumor stroma border (arrows) as compared to cells in the center of tumors that spontaneously developed in a C3(1)TAg model of breast cancer and in an orthotopic syngeneic model of breast cancer (4T1 cells/BALB/c mice).We next asked if TGF-\u03b2 was the component of the CoCM that was responsible for the expanded metastatic range of CA1a cells treated with CoCM. To do this we included the ALK5 kinase inhibitor SB431542 during the 4 day pretreatment of CA1a cells with CoCM. After washing away the SB431542 together with the CoCM, the CA1a cells were injected into NOD SCID mice using the same experimental design as before. Ex vivo incubation of CA1a cells with CoCM and SB431542 as compared to CoCM, resulted in significantly increased survival rates in tail vein metastasis assays (Fig. 5D). Again, we observed that animals injected with CoCM treated cells or with CoCM + SB435142 treated cells equally developed lung metastases (Fig. 5C), and when re-plated in regular culture medium, proliferation of CA1a cells pre-treated with CoCM was equal to proliferation of CA1a cells pretreated with CoCM +SB431542, indicating that SB431542 did not negatively influence proliferation or survival of pre-treated cells (data not shown). However, only 1/14 animal injected with CoCM + SB431542 developed an extrapulmonary tumor, while 5/15 animals that were injected with CoCM treated tumors developed extrapulmonary tumors in tail vein assays (Fig. 5C). Thus, a transient in vitro exposure of CA1a cells to CoCM and consequent activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in these cells not only durably increases tumorigenicity but also permits successful colonization of a wider range of target tissues.Active TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Is Sustained in Tumors Originating from CoCM Treated CellsWe next asked if TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells is durably increased in vivo after stimulation of CA1a cells with TGF-\u03b2 containing CoCM in vitro. Nuclear pSmad2 levels were higher in xenograft tumors or metastatic tumors originating from CoCM treated cells than in xenograft tumors originating from medium treated cells (Fig. 6B). Thus, increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in CA1a cells by treatment with CoCM is sustained in vivo, indicating that the transient exposure of CA1a cells to elevated TGF-\u03b2 levels causes a durable change in TGF-\u03b2 signaling activity.TGF-\u03b2 Signaling Is Increased at the Tumor - Stroma Border of Tumors in Several Mouse ModelsNext, we investigated whether TGF-\u03b2 signaling is increased when tumor cells invade the fibroblast-containing stroma surrounding a primary tumor as would be predicted from our observations. Immunostaining of pSmad2 in sections of mammary tumors derived from different mouse breast cancer models (CA1a xenograft tumors, syngeneic mouse mammary tumor (4T1), and tumors from the C3(1)TAg transgenic model) revealed that pSmad2 levels are higher in cells at the tumor stroma border, and particularly in those cells invading the surrounding stroma, as compared to tumor cells in the center of the tumor (Fig. 6C). Thus, activation of pSmad2 naturally occurs when tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma.Taken together, our results imply that tumor cells, once they traverse through the surrounding stroma, can subvert normal fibroblasts to increase levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in the microenvironment that then induces tumor cell migration, cell scattering, and an expanded metastatic pattern, thereby boosting the malignancy of tumor cells (Fig. 7).Tumor-stroma interactions increase malignancy of tumor cells by bidirectional effects of TGF-\u03b2.Direct interactions of tumor cells and fibroblasts as they occur when parenchymal tumor cells invade the underlying stroma increase secretion of TGF-\u03b2 by tumor cells as well as by fibroblasts. TGF-\u03b2 has bidirectional effects on both cells types. Fibroblast derived TGF-\u03b2 can directly stimulate tumor cell migration and malignancy. Tumor cell derived TGF-\u03b2 induces fibroblasts to secrete MMP-9. Increased MMP-9 levels then might further increase levels of active TGF-\u03b2, and also facilitate matrix degradation and migration of tumor cells, further increasing the malignant potential of tumor cells.DiscussionInteractions between tumor cells and the fibroblasts of the tumor microenvironment are complex, reciprocal and stage-dependent. Here we have shown that transient interactions of breast carcinoma cells with normal fibroblasts in vitro can increase tumor cell malignancy and expand the metastatic range of tumor cells in vivo by a TGF-\u03b2 dependent mechanism. Specifically, the interaction of human breast carcinoma cells with normal murine fibroblasts induces aberrant secretion of active TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts. This transient exposure of tumor cells to fibroblast-derived TGF-\u03b2 then durably increases tumorigenesis even when the two cell types are no longer interacting. Thus, tumor cells traversing through connective tissue may exploit their transient interaction with normal fibroblasts so as to get a boost in the metastatic process (Fig. 7). This phenomenon has a number of interesting features that are discussed below.Emergent Properties and Reciprocity in the Co-CulturesThe interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts can generate emergent system properties that are not seen when the cells are cultured separately. Our experimental design allowed us to focus specifically on the impact of this interaction on the tumor cells, and to start to identify soluble mediators. We showed that co-culture of the two cell types significantly increased the levels of fibroblast derived active TGF-\u03b2 in the extracellular environment, and that this TGF-\u03b2 subsequently enhanced migration of the tumor cells in vitro and malignant behavior in vivo. It has been previously proposed that tumor cells can induce a reversibly \u201cprimed state\u201d in normal fibroblasts, in which the fibroblasts can promote tumorigenesis even though they do not have all the characteristics of the irreversibly modified CAFs. Our data suggest that such priming may involve cancer cell-induced production of active TGF-\u03b2 by the fibroblasts. It is likely that TGF-\u03b2 produced by these primed fibroblasts contributes to the elevated TGF-\u03b2 levels that are seen in the vicinity of many advanced human tumors.Co-cultures of fibroblasts and tumor cells showed increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling in both cell compartments, consistent with the presence of activated TGF-\u03b2 in the CoCM (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that TGF-\u03b2 derived from the tumor cell compartment in this co-culture model can induce MMP-9 secretion by fibroblasts in a Smad-, ras- and PI3K dependent fashion. In the present work, we demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 derived from the fibroblast compartment enhanced the migration of tumor cells through the activation of Smad-, p38- and JNK-signaling cascades. Together the data suggest that TGF-\u03b2-mediated signaling between the tumor cells and fibroblasts is bidirectional, involves a distinct combination of signaling cascades in each partner, and has different molecular outcomes in each compartment. It is currently not clear how the two cell types can selectively respond to the TGF-\u03b2 produced by the other, but this phenomenon conceivably might reflect differences in TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, and/or structure of the latent complexes made by each cell type, as well as cell specific regulation of signal flux through the TGF-\u03b2 network within each cell type. However, since MMP-9 can create a microenvironment more favorable to invasion and metastasis through activation of growth factors, specifically TGF-\u03b2, and destruction of extracellular matrix, the combined biological outcome of the differing effects of TGF-\u03b2 on each compartment is likely to be a further enhancement of malignant behavior (Fig. 7).Transient Tumor-Fibroblast Interactions Generate Small Magnitude Molecular Effects That Induce Major Changes in OutcomeExposure of rat mammary tumor cells to exogenous TGF-\u03b2 ex vivo has previously been shown to promote metastatic efficiency in vivo . Here we have shown that transient interactions between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts, such as might occur when tumor cells traverse the surrounding tissue, can have a similar effect. The amount of active TGF-\u03b2 that was produced by the coculture was very low, and the activation of downstream signaling pathways was similarly mild (Figs 2 to   5). Nevertheless, these small magnitude, endogenous molecular effects altered the phenotype of the tumor cell such that it showed significantly increased malignant behavior even when no longer in contact with the fibroblast compartment. The data imply that carcinoma cells that have breached the basement membrane and are migrating through underlying connective tissue may be able to subvert and use resident, TGF-\u03b2 secreting fibroblasts to boost their motility and subsequent metastatic spread.Underlying MechanismsTGF-\u03b2 has a number of tumor cell-targeted effects that could contribute to the enhanced malignancy, including enhancement of tumor cell migration and invasion, direct effects on tumor cell survival, and changes in the composition of secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix components. The stimulatory effect of CoCM on primary tumor growth may reflect pro-survival effects of TGF-\u03b2 on CA1a cells as TGF-\u03b2 reduces apoptosis of CA1a cells (Fig. S1B), possibly acting in concert with other as yet unidentified trophic factors in the CM.The ability of TGF-\u03b2 to promote migration and invasion of CA1a cells may contribute to the enhanced metastasis, but additional mechanisms such as altered expression levels of junctional proteins like E-cadherin, integrins, or chemokines and chemokine receptors are also likely to play a role. For example, the organ tropism of metastatic tumors is determined in part by the spectrum of chemokines and chemokine receptors that they express, and TGF-\u03b2s have been shown to modulate relevant chemokine ligand/receptor axes in other models. TGF-\u03b2 derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts upregulates CXCR4 in initiated prostatic epithelial cells, and expression of CXCR4 correlates with lymph node metastasis in multiple human tumors. It will be the aim of future work to determine which mechanism is relevant for the expanded metastatic range shown by the CA1a breast cancer cells stimulated with fibroblast derived TGF-\u03b2.Consequences and ConclusionsIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that a relatively short-lived interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts induces changes in the localized extracellular microenvironment that then substantially increase the malignancy of the tumor cells even after the original interaction has ceased. The data imply that normal resident fibroblasts that are exposed to direct contact with invading tumor cells may boost the motility and subsequent metastatic spread of these carcinoma cells. TGF-\u03b2 appears to be a key player in this process, providing further rationale for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics that target the TGF-\u03b2 pathway.Materials and MethodsCell Culture and Generation of Conditioned MediaMCF10CA1a (\u201cCA1a\u201d) is a malignant, metastatic human breast cancer line. Mouse dermal fibroblasts (DF) were derived from newborn mice as previously described. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from embryos (ED 12 to ED 14) by suspending embryonic tissue in DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (\u201cfibroblast medium\u201d). CA1a and DF were respectively grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% horse serum (\u201cCA1a medium\u201d) and DMEM, low glucose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen or Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). To obtain conditioned media from homotypic cultures or cocultures, 1.5\u00d7106 cells of each type were plated in a 150 cm2 dish and incubated in a 1\u22361 mixture of CA1a- and fibroblast medium (\u201ccoculture medium\u201d). Culture supernatants were collected after 4 d and cells were removed by centrifugation (200 g, 5 min). Acellular supernatants were diluted with fresh coculture medium (conditioned medium, CM) and used for further experiments.Cell Scattering and MigrationDot AssayTo assess cell scattering, 20 \u00b5l of cell suspension (3\u00d7106 CA1a cells/ml) were placed in each well of 6-well plates and allowed to adhere to form tight well-circumscribed colonies. After 3 hours non-attached cells were removed by rinsing the plate with calcium-containing Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were incubated in regular culture medium overnight, and then switched for 4 days to a 1\u22361 mixture of CM and fresh coculture medium. Cell scattering was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically following staining with hematoxylin-eosin. Unconditioned medium served as an additional negative control. The effect of growth factors and cytokines on cell scattering was assessed by adding the following growth factors in concentrations as indicated to the culture medium for 4 days: human TGF-\u03b21, human EGF, LAP (all R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), human TNF-\u03b1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and HGF (kind gift from Don Bottaro). Where indicated, small molecule inhibitors of various signaling pathways (ALK4,5,7: SB431542, 5 \u00b5M, Sigma, St. Louis, MO; MEK/Erk: PD98059, 25 \u00b5M; p38: SB203580, 10 \u00b5M; JNK: SP600125, 10 \u00b5M (all Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)) were added to cultures 30 min before stimulation with the conditioned medium. Equal amounts of DMSO served as a negative control.Scratch AssayCA1a cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown to confluence. Cell proliferation was blocked by a 30 min pretreatment with mitomycin C (25 \u00b5g/ml). A scratch was then made in each well using a 100 \u00b5l pipette tip and cells were stimulated with the various CM in 1\u22361 mixtures with fresh coculture medium. The scratch width at different time points was imaged and measured using ImagePro. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 2.0.Immunostaining and Western BlottingImmunofluorescence and Western Blotting were performed following established protocols. The following antibodies were used: Immunofluorescence: phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, phospho-ATF2, phospho-MAPKAPK2 (all 1\u2236100, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and E-cadherin (1\u2236800, Zymed, Carlsbad, CA). Western Blotting: Smad3 (1\u22361000, Zymed), Smad2/3 (1\u22361000, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), phospho-Smad3 (1\u223612 000, Gift from E. Leoff), phospho-Smad2, phospho-TAK, TAK (both 1\u22361000, Cell Signaling), and actin (1\u223660 000, BD Biosciences) for Western Blotting. Immunoperoxidase staining for phospho-Smad2 (1\u2236500, Millipore, Temecula,CA) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections.Transfection, Reporter Assays, and Lentiviral InfectionTransfection of CA1a cells with the CAGA12-luciferase plasmid or with the reporter plasmids ARE-luciferase/FAST-1, and lentiviral infections were performed as described previously.Quantification of TGF-\u03b2Levels of active TGF-\u03b2 in CM were determined using PAI-driven luciferase expression in CCL-64 cells. Briefly, CCL-64 cells that were stably transfected with PAI-luc were cultured in 48-well plates (20000 cells/well) in 200 \u00b5l RPMI supplemented with 5% FCS for 36 hours and serum starved (RPMI supplemented with 1% FCS) for 8 hours. Then 100 \u00b5l medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul CM (sample) or 100 \u00b5l unconditioned medium spiked with varying concentrations of TGF-\u03b21 to establish a standard curve. Cells were incubated over night, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In vivo TumorigenesisFemale SCID and NOD SCID animals (age: 8\u201310 weeks) were purchased from the NCI Animal Production Program. For tumorigenesis studies, 4\u00d7104 tumor cells in 50 \u00b5l DPBS were bilaterally injected into the # II and # VII mammary fat pads of female SCID mice. Tumor size was assessed using calipers. Tumor volumes were calculated by the formula for an oblique spheroid (S\u00d7S\u00d7L)\u00d70.52, where S and L are the short and long dimensions, respectively. Tail vein injection assays were performed by injecting 2\u00d7105 cells in 100 \u00b5l DPBS into the tail vein of female NOD SCID animals. Mice were euthanized after 8 weeks or when animals became moribund and examined grossly on necropsy for the presence of metastases in multiple organs.

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

        "content": "A considerable fraction of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is located in the fibroblast-rich stromal compartment of desmoplastic breast carcinoma. We analyzed the migratory activity of blood monocytes (MO), the precursor cells of TAM, into 3-D cultures of carcinoma cells and fibroblasts from breast tumor origin. MO migration into breast tumor spheroids was highly variable: Hs578T spheroids showed high MO infiltration rates, T47D cultures were intermediate, whereas BT549, BT474 and MCF-7 spheroids were poorly infiltrated. MO infiltration was also high in tumor-derived fibroblast spheroids; however, no MO subpopulation with specific infiltrative potential was identified by CD14/CD16 expression profile. The infiltration of MO could be inhibited by pre-exposure to pertussis and cholera toxins, but only pertussis toxin, which blocks G(i) protein function, entirely inhibited MO migration. The G(i) coupled CCL2 receptor CCR2A/2B was expressed on roughly all MO. Furthermore, highly infiltrated tumor-derived fibroblast and Hs578T spheroids secreted considerable amounts of CCL2. In line with this, the infiltration of MO into fibroblast spheroids was suppressed by either addition of recombinant CCL2 to disturb the CCL2 gradient or by pre-incubation of MO with a CCR2A/2B blocking antibody. MO infiltration of Hs578T spheroids, however, could not be inhibited by CCL2 receptor blockade. Our study clearly shows that the CCL2-CCR2A/2B pathway is crucial for the recruitment of blood MO into tumor fibroblastic areas, whereas additional factors may be relevant for the migration of MO into tumor cell sites.",

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

        "content": "Tumor metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have tropism towards tumor tissues, and can be converted into tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cells (TA-MSCs) to facilitate TNBC metastasis through interactions with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and unclear, and effective strategies to suppress tumor metastasis via eliminating TA-MSCs are still lacking. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1) was overexpressed in TA-MSCs, which prompts TA-MSCs to secrete multiple C-C motif chemokine ligands, promoting C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)<sup+</sup TAM recruitment and facilitating TAM polarization into the M2 phenotype, thereby promoting TNBC pulmonary metastasis. Z-GP-DAVLBH, an FAP\u03b1-activated vinblastine prodrug, induces FAP\u03b1<sup+</sup TA-MSC apoptosis, which significantly suppresses CCR2<sup+</sup TAM recruitment and polarization, thus inhibiting pulmonary metastasis of orthotopic TNBC cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenografts. This study provides insight into an important role of FAP\u03b1 in mediating TA-MSC-induced TNBC metastasis and provides compelling evidence that targeting TA-MSCs with an FAP\u03b1-activated prodrug is a promising strategy for suppressing TNBC metastasis.",

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

        "content": "Fibroblasts expressing the orphan chemokine CXCL14 have been previously shown to associate with poor breast cancer prognosis and promote cancer growth. This study explores the mechanism underlying the poor survival associations of stromal CXCL14. Tumor cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and metastasis were studied in <iin vitro</i and <iin vivo</i models together with fibroblasts overexpressing CXCL14. An approach for CXCL14 receptor identification included loss-of-function studies followed by molecular and functional endpoints. The clinical relevance was further explored in publicly available gene expression datasets. CXCL14 fibroblasts stimulated breast cancer EMT, migration, and invasion in breast cancer cells and in a xenograft model. Furthermore, tumor cells primed by CXCL14 fibroblasts displayed enhanced lung colonization after tail-vein injection. By loss-of function experiments, the atypical G-protein-coupled receptor ACKR2 was identified to mediate CXCL14-stimulated responses. Downregulation of ACKR2, or CXCL14-induced NOS1, attenuated the pro-EMT and migratory capacity. CXCL14/ACKR2 expression correlated with EMT and survival in gene expression datasets. Collectively, the findings imply an autocrine fibroblast CXCL14/ACKR2 pathway as a clinically relevant stimulator of EMT, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis. The study also identifies ACKR2 as a novel mediator for CXCL14 function and thereby defines a pathway with drug target potential.<iSee related commentary by Zhang et al., p. 3476</i.",

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

H Semi-quantitative ROI values of mean fluorescence intensity at tumor sites. **p\u2009<\u20090.01; Data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation of three technical replicates; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a01C, D, the glycosyls of Rg3 at the C3-position were oriented towards the water molecules and sticked out of the surface of the liposomal membrane, which could potentially interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation. A Concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1-cultured medium (CM) after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Scale bar: 2\u00a0mm. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Unpaired t-test was used for analysis of differences between two groups. Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

All animals were treated according to the Guide for the Care and Laboratory Animals and all experiments were approved and performed according to the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Fudan University (certificate number: 2020-04-YJ-WJX-01).Preparation and characterization of liposomesThe formulation in which PL-100\u00a0M/ Rg3 (or cholesterol)/docetaxel dissolved at the weight ratio of 10:3:1 in the organic solution (chloroform: ethanol 1:1) was prepared. The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above. The particle size and zeta potential of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were determined on a Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). Meanwhile, the morphology of the DTX-loaded liposomes was observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, USA).To examine storage stability of liposomes, the prepared liposomes were stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 for 7\u00a0days. The size and leakage of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were measured every day for seven days. The mean size of the liposomes stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 were measured by DLS every day. The DTX content remaining as loaded in liposomes was tested every day to determine the change of encapsulation efficacy of DTX-loaded liposomes during the storage period using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the leakage percentage of DTX was obtained according to the following equation.Molecular dynamic simulation of Rg3-LpA 700-ns dynamic simulations at a time step of 2\u00a0fs were applied to establish the initial system (DSPC:Rg3:water molecules\u2009=\u2009128:6:10,484). Then, a larger mixed bilayer system consisting of 300 DSPC and 90 Rg3 molecules was generated with memgen tool. a total of 300\u00a0ns simulation was conducted for the system. The CHARMM36 force field was applied through MD simulations,. NPT ensemble was applied for the simulation with the Nose\u2013Hoover thermostat to keep the temperature at 300\u00a0K and the Parrinello\u2013Rhaman method to maintain a constant pressure of 1\u00a0atm. LINCS algorithm was applied for the constraint of H-bonds lengths. Partical-Mesh Ewald (PME) method was utilized to calculate the long-rang electrostatic interactions with PME grid of 0.12\u00a0nm in the reciprocal-apace interactions and cubic interpolation. The cut-off distance for the long-range neighbor list of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 12\u00a0\u00c5. Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was recorded (Ex/Em\u2009=\u2009360\u00a0nm/430\u00a0nm), respectively after leaving the mixture at room temperature for 12\u00a0h. The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score. The optimal docking conformation was determined based on the docking score and hydrogen bonding interactions. PyMol was utilized to generate the ribbon/surface view of docked complexes.Intracellular uptake assay of the liposomes by 4T1 cells2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well. In Rg3-Lp/C6\u2009+\u2009glucose, Rg3-Lp/C6\u2009+\u2009WZB117 groups, the medium was aspired after 12\u00a0h. 20\u00a0mM glucose solution and 10\u00a0\u03bcM WZB117 was added and incubated with cells for 1\u00a0h, respectively. The cells were then treated with C-Lp loaded with C6 (C-Lp/C6) and Rg3-Lp loaded with C6 (Rg3-Lp/C6) respectively (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL) for 4\u00a0h. The cells were then collected, washed three times with pre-chilled PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA).Intracellular uptake of liposomes by Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cellsGlut 1 siRNA (5\u2019- CCAACUGGACCUCAAACUUTT -3\u2019) and siRNA mate were mixed in opti-MEM medium to form siRNA complexes. Then siRNA complex was added in cell culture medium and incubated with 4T1 cells for 72\u00a0h. Then, C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 was added in the medium respectively for 4\u00a0h (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL). The cells were prepared and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA). For confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) observation, the cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained and imaged as described previously.In vitro cytotoxicity studiesThe cytotoxicity of free DTX and different DTX formulations against 4T1 cells was examined with MTT cytotoxicity assay. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 4T1 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. After 12\u00a0h, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, mixture of Rg3 and DTX (Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX within a certain DTX concentration range was added in the medium and incubated with 4T1 cells for 48\u00a0h, respectively. 50 \u03bcL of MTT (2\u00a0mg/mL) was then added and incubated for another 4\u00a0h. Then, the medium was aspirated and 200 \u03bcL DMSO was added. After shaking for 30\u00a0min, the optical density (OD) value of each well was measured at 490\u00a0nm using a microplate reader (Tecan Trading Co., Ltd., Switzerland). The cell viability rate was calculated according to the following formula:Control: Untreated cells (viability rate 100%); Blank: (the wells with no cells).Cell apoptosis assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well. DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX was added in the medium and incubated with 4T1 cells, respectively (DTX 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Then the cells were collected and washed with PBS. Next, the cells were further stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V-FITC in binding buffer for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. The apoptosis rate of the cells was then analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA).At the same time, the 4T1 cells suspension (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105/ mL) was inoculated into 12-well plate with prepared cell sheets (0.1\u00a0ml cell suspension every cell sheet). The drug solution was changed according to the group described before after 24\u00a0h. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33,342 and PI after 48\u00a0h of induction, then mounted with glycerol jelly mounting medium and exposed to inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) for qualitative observation and photo taking.Culture and polarization induction of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM)Bone marrow cells were collected from 6\u20138-week old specific pathogen-free male Balb/c mice as described above. Bone marrow cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 20\u00a0ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 96\u00a0h to induce bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) differentiation. Interferon-\u03b3 (20\u00a0ng/mL) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 500\u00a0ng/mL) were added to the medium for 24\u00a0h to induce the polarization toward M1 phenotype.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-cultured medium after different treatment was then collected. Then, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated for 24\u00a0h with 4T1-CM plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor or with different 4T1 cultured medium collected from 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX). 3T3 cultured medium collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with PBS (3T3-CM), 4T1-CM (3T3-CM @ 4T1-CM), 4T1-CM/SB-431542 (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM/SB-431542)), 4T1-CM@DTX (3T3-CM@ (4T1-CM@DTX)), 4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX (3T3-CM@ (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX)), 4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM)), 4T1-CM@Rg3 (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3)), 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), 4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX)) or 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX)) were collected. The M1-type macrophages were incubated with different conditioned 3T3 cultured medium. After 48\u00a0h, the cells were collected and incubated with APC-F4/80 (BioLegend, UK), FITC-CD206 (BioLegend, UK) and PE-CD86 (BioLegend, UK) antibodies to label M2 and M1 cells, respectively. Then, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA).Penetration assay of the liposomes in 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroidsUnlike the spontaneous process of enriching fibroblasts by tumor cells during tumor progression in vivo, tumor cells were mixed with fibroblasts NIH-3T3 cells in vitro to manually mimic the stroma-rich TME. 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids containing 4T1 and NIH-3T3 were generated. 0.6\u00a0g of agarose was weighed and added to 30\u00a0mL of serum-free DMEM medium containing 1% cyan-chain double antibody, and kept in a constant temperature water bath at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, then transferred to the autoclave at 121\u00a0\u00b0C. Sterilize under high pressure for 30\u00a0min. After sterilization, the agarose solution was added to a 96-well plate with 50 \u03bcL per well. The 4T1 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts were then digested, mixed and added to a 96-well cell culture plate containing agarose gel at 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/100 \u03bcL and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/100 \u03bcL per well respectively. It was placed in a 37\u00b0 C incubator for cultivation. The fluid was changed every other day, and the tumor sphere grew to about 500\u00a0\u03bcm after 10\u00a0days. C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 were then administered, respectively. After incubating for 12\u00a0h, the tumor spheres were washed three times with PBS buffered saline solution, then transferred to a small dish, fluorescence of C6 was observed with CLSM (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) from the top layer of the tumor sphere to the bottom layer, a tomographic scan is performed every 10\u00a0\u03bcm. After the scanning, the penetration depth of the nanoparticles is analyzed and counted by the ZEN software provided by the instrument.Immunofluorescence staining of \u03b1-SMA1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, different 4T1 cultured medium after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX) (DTX concentration, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), respectively. 4T1-conditioned medium after different treatment was obtained for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA assay) after 24\u00a0h. The 3T3 cells after different treatment were then IF stained and imaged with primary anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab124964, Abcam) and Cy3-labeled fluorescent secondary antibody (33108ES60, Yeasen) according to the procedure as described before.In vivo imaging of tumor bearing mice5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were orthotopically injected into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of Balb/c female mice to develop the orthotopic TNBC model. Treatment was initiated at about 7\u00a0days after inoculation. The tumor bearing mice were divided randomly into two groups and were injected intravenously with C-Lp/DiD and Rg3-Lp/DiD respectively. In vivo fluorescent images were taken under in vivo imaging system (IVIS) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24\u00a0h after injection. After 24\u00a0h, the mice were killed. Tumors, hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys were then collected and imaged under IVIS system.In vivo antitumor efficacyOrthotopic TNBC model was developed by injecting 4T1 cells into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of BALB/c female mice. After 7\u00a0days, the mice were divided randomly into 8 groups (n\u2009=\u20096 per group) and each treated group was injected intravenously with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX (10\u00a0mg/kg of DTX) every 4\u00a0days for 20\u00a0days respectively. The length and width of tumors and the body weight were measured simultaneously. The tumor volume (V) was calculated using the following formula:Length (L) is the longest diameter and width (W) is the shortest diameter perpendicular to length. At Day 20, all mice were sacrificed, and their tumors were harvested for photo imaging and histological examination. For the histological analysis of apoptosis cells and CAFs in tumor tissue, the TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and \u03b1-SMA staining of tumor slices was performed and full-scanned, In addition, for the histological analysis of the collagen in tumor tissue, MASSON staining was conducted and five randomly chosen microscopic fields were selected and semi-quantified by ImageJ software.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-CM after different treatment was then collected. The concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in the different medium was detected with ELISA kit (Neobioscience Co., Ltd., China) according to manufacturer's instruction. The results were read using a microplate spectrophotometer at 450\u00a0nm (Thermo Multiskan MK3, USA). Tumor tissues were obtained according to the protocol in In vivo antitumor efficacy and homogenized with pre-cooled PBS (5\u00a0ml PBS/1\u00a0g tumor). The prepared homogenate was centrifuged at 5000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min and the TGF-\u03b2 concentration in the supernatant was detected with the ELISA kit (Neobioscience Co., Ltd., China) according to manufacturer's instruction.Western Blot (WB) assay3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate at a density of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells per well and treated overnight with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, different 4T1 cultured medium after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1@Rg3-Lp/DTX) (DTX 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The protein of the cells was then harvested according to the procedures described previously. 50\u00a0mg of protein per lane were loaded on the polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab124964, Abcam), anti-phospho-Smad2/3 (ab272332, Abcam) and anti-GAPDH (30202ES40, Yeasen) overnight at 4\u2103 respectively. The following procedure was performed as previously described.Quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytesTumor tissues were obtained according to the protocol in In vivo antitumor efficacy. Cell suspensions derived from the obtained tumor tissues were prepared by grinding tumor tissues and passing the homogenate through 200-mesh sieve. The cell suspensions were then co-incubated with antibodies for T cells staining (CD45, CD4 and CD8), myeloid-derived suppressor cells staining (Gr1, CD11b and CD45), Tregs staining (CD45, CD4 and Foxp3), macrophages staining(CD45, F4/80, CD86 or CD206) and CAFs staining (\u03b1-SMA) for FACS analysis (BD Biosciences, USA).Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) analysisTotal RNAs were extracted with Trizol from tumor tissues obtained following the protocol of Quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis were performed according to the procedures described before. The mouse \u03b1-SMA primer pairs were 5\u2032- ACACGGCATCATCACCAACTG -3\u2032 and 5\u2032- TTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGTGGTGTC-3\u2032, The mouse GAPDH primer pairs were 5\u2019- CCTCGTCCCGTAGACAAAATG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTCGT-3\u2032.Safety evaluationTumor bearing mice were randomly divided into 8 groups. The administration protocol was the same as described above. At the end point, after the mice were sacrificed, their main organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney) were excised and weighted for the calculation of organ weight index, then treated for histological examination. Blood samples were also collected for routine blood analyses.Statistical analysisResults are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), derived from stroma of cancer tissues, interact with cancer cells and play an important role in cancer initiation, growth, and metastasis. Nab-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is a 130 nm albumin-binding paclitaxel and recommended for many types of cancer chemotherapy. The nab-PTX stromal-disrupting effect during pancreatic cancer treatment has been reported. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of nab-PTX in cancer cells and CAF interaction. Cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1) were cocultured with CAF or treated with CAF conditioned medium, after which their migration and invasion ability, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related marker expression and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) expression and secretion were detected. Nab-PTX treatment was carried out during the coculture system or during preparation of CAF conditioned medium. Then cancer cell migration and invasion ability, EMT-related marker expression, CXCL10 expression and secretion, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression and secretion by CAF were checked After coculture with CAF, migration and invasion ability of cancer cells increased. CAF also downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated N-cadherin and vimentin expression in cancer cells. During coculture or stimulation with cancer cell-cultured medium, CAF significantly increased IL-6 expression and secretion. However, nab-PTX in the coculture system canceled CAF-induced migration and invasion promotion and EMT-related gene changes. Moreover, nab-PTX increased CXCL10 expression of cancer cells which blocked CAF IL-6 expression and secretion. Nab-PTX treatment could increase CXCL10 expression of cancer cells which blocks CAF cancer cell migration and invasion-promoting effect by inhibiting IL-6 expression.",

In pancreatic cancer, cancer cell\u2010derived cytokines activate pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) forming the CAF phenotype and contribute to pancreatic extensive desmoplasia.3 Also, CAF can secrete many kinds of extracellular matrix components, cytokines, growth factors, and proteases participating in tumor\u2010stroma cross\u2010talk. Recent studies showed that CAF could not only promote tumorigenesis, growth, and angiogenesis but also facilitate invasion and metastasis.4, 5, 6 Therefore, a new target for cancer chemotherapy is to interrupt cancer cells and CAF interaction.7 Nab\u2010paclitaxel is a new paclitaxel nanoparticle formulation in which the paclitaxel is bound to albumin. Nab\u2010PTX, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 as the first line in neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer, is widely used in clinical work and significantly improves outcome.8 Taking advantage of albumin\u2010binding, nab\u2010PTX efficiently accumulates in peri\u2010 and intratumoral areas dependent or independent of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) mediating.9, 10 Many clinical and animal studies showed that nab\u2010PTX treatment could disrupt tumor stroma, decrease PSC activity, and inflammatory cytokines.11 However, the role of nab\u2010PTX in tumor cells and CAF communication is unclear.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of nab\u2010PTX on CAF\u2010induced tumor cell migration and invasion.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell culture and treatmentPancreatic cancer cell lines MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101 were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). CAF were isolated from human pancreatic tissue resected from a pancreatic cancer patient by out\u2010growing methods as previously reported.12 The patient was newly diagnosed and had not received any relevant treatment prior to surgery. This was authorized in advance by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Tokushima Graduate School (approved ID number: 2790), and the patient provided written informed consent prior to donating the specimens. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101 were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) with 10% FBS (Life Technologies Ltd) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. CAF were purchased from Cellular Engineering Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA, USA) Cells were cultured in HLCAF.E.Media\u2010450 (Cellular Engineering Technologies Inc.) with 10% FBS.Nab\u2010paclitaxel (Abraxis; Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) was dissolved with PBS. Cancer cells were treated with 5 ng/mL nab\u2010paclitaxel\u2010containing medium for 24 hours.CAF conditioning medium preparationCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts were grown with complete media in 6\u2010well dishes for 24 hours to reach 70%\u201080% confluency. The 80% confluency cancer cells (MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101) were cultured with 1% FBS DMEM for 24 hours and then changed to complete medium of CAF to cancer cells with 1% FBS culture medium for another 24\u2010hour culture. After that, the FBS\u2010free medium culture was followed. After 24\u2010hour culture, the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.2\u2010\u03bcm filter before use. For the CXCL10 or interleukin (IL)\u20106 of conditioned medium neutralization, CXCL10 (266\u2010IP; R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or IL\u20106 (7270\u2010IL; R&D) antibody was added to the conditioned medium with a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg/mL and incubated for 1 hour before use.Migration and invasion assayTranswell inserts (Corning, NY, USA) of 8 \u03bcm pore size were used for migration assay and precoated with Matrigel matrix (Corning) for invasion assay. MIA PaCa\u20102 (5 \u00d7 104) or Panc\u20101 (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber, and 1\u20102 \u00d7 104 CAF were seeded in the lower chamber separately. After cell attachment, both chambers were gently washed twice with DMEM, and then the upper chambers were inserted and incubated with serum\u2010free DMEM. After 24\u2010hour incubation, the cells which moved through the members of Transwells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet. The stained cells were counted under a microscope.Enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assayLevel of IL\u20106 and CXCL10 was determined using IL\u20106 and CXCL10 Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a plate reader (SpectraMax i3; Molecular Devices, Tokyo, Japan) at a correction wavelength of 540 nm.Polymerase chain reaction analysisTotal RNA of each sample was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The following TaqMan assays (assay identification number) were used: CDH1 (Hs01023895_m1), CDH12 (Hs00362037_m1), vimentin (Hs00958111_m1), IL\u20106 (Hs00174131_m1), and CXCL10 (Hs00171042_m1). GAPDH (4352339E) was selected as internal control. StepOnePlus Real\u2010Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) was used to carry out qRT\u2010PCR.Cytokine arraySupernatants of cancer cells (Panc\u20101) with or without nab\u2010PTX treatment were collected, and the particulates were removed by filtration through a 0.2\u2010\u03bcm filter. Cytokines in supernatants were detected with a Proteome Profiler Human Cytokine Array Kit (ARY005B; R&D Systems). After blocking, membranes were incubated with samples and antibody cocktail overnight at 4\u00b0C. After incubation, the membranes were washed and incubated with streptavidin\u2010HRP at room temperature for 30 minutes. Chemiluminescent detection reagents were incubated with the membrane for 1 minute, and the signal intensities on the membranes were detected with chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfort, UK).Western blottingA RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing both the protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and the PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Tokyo, Japan) was used to lyse cells. Protein concentrations were then measured with a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and equal amounts of extracted proteins were separated on 10% SDS\u2010PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibody including E\u2010cadherin (ab15148; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), N\u2010cadherin (ab76011; Abcam), Vimentin (ab92547; Abcam), and \u03b2\u2010actin (#4967; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), followed by the appropriate HRP\u2010conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were detected with chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).Statistical analysisData are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analyses were carried out by ANOVA or Student's t test by SPSS 19.0 (IBM, NY, USA). Student's t test was used to compare the difference between 2 groups. One\u2010way analysis of variance (one\u2010way ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni test was used to compare the differences between more than 2 groups. P\u2010value <.05 indicated a statistically significant difference.RESULTSCAF promote pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasionTo investigate the effect of CAF on cancer cell migration and invasion, the cancer cells were cocultured with CAF for 24 hours. Compared with monoculture, cancer cells cocultured with CAF significantly increased the cell number transferred through the polyester or Matrigel matrix\u2010coated polyester (Figure 1A,B). Also, the conditioned medium derived from CAF which were stimulated with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (CAF\u2010CM) significantly increased cancer cell migration and invasion ability.Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) promoted pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. Pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101) cocultured with CAF (+CAF) or cultured in CAF\u2010conditioned medium (+CAF\u2010CM). A,B, Migration assay (A) and invasion assay (B) of cancer cells were monitored at 24 h (*significantly different from Ctrl group, P < .05, n = 4). Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. C,D, PCR analysis and western blot for detection of epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition\u2010related gene (E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, and vimentin) expression of cancer cells (*significantly different from Ctrl group, P < .05, n = 4)Epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition is essential for cancer cell migration and invasion.13 We detected EMT\u2010related gene changes of cancer cells after coculture with CAF or stimulation with CAF\u2010CM. Both coculture with CAF and stimulation with CAF\u2010CM decreased E\u2010cadherin but increased N\u2010cadherin and vimentin expression of both MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101 (Figure 1C,D).CAF\u2010derived IL\u20106 increased cancer cell migration and invasion by promoting EMTA previous study reported that IL\u20106 is a protumor cytokine, which can promote cancer cell migration.14 To determine the role of IL\u20106 during CAF tumor cell interaction, we measured IL\u20106 expression and secretion by CAF. Results showed that coculture with cancer cells or stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium significantly increased IL\u20106 secretion and expression (Figure 2A,B). Next, we used an IL\u20106 antibody to neutralize IL\u20106 in the coculture system or CAF\u2010CM. After IL\u20106 neutralization, migration and invasion ability of cancer cells showed a significant difference compared with the coculture or CAF\u2010CM group (Figure 2C,D). Moreover, the epithelial and mesenchymal markers of cancer cells also appeared statistically different after IL\u20106 neutralization (Figure 2E\u2010G).Cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF) derived interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) promoted pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. A,B, PCR analysis (A) and ELISA (B) for IL\u20106 expression and secretion of CAF showed that IL\u20106 expression of CAF significantly increased after coculture with cancer cells (MIA PaCa\u20102 coculture and Panc\u20101 coculture) or stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (Mia\u2010CM and Panc\u20101\u2010CM) for 24 h (*significantly different from Ctrl group, P < .05, n = 4). C,D, Migration assay (C) and invasion assay (D) for cancer cells cocultured with CAF in normal or IL\u20106 neutralized coculture system and stimulation by CAF\u2010CM with or without IL\u20106 neutralization (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, n = 4). Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. E,F, PCR analysis for epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition\u2010related gene expression of MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101 (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, n = 4). G, Western blot for E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, and vimentin expression of MIA PaCa\u20102 and Panc\u20101Nab\u2010PTX canceled CAF\u2010induced cancer cell migration and invasionIn order to investigate the effect of nab\u2010PTX on the interaction between cancer cells and CAF, during cancer cell and CAF coculture, 5 ng/mL nab\u2010PTX (this dosage had no effect on the cell viability of MIA PaCa\u20102, Panc\u20101, and CAF, data not shown) treatment was carried out during cancer cell and CAF coculture. After nab\u2010PTX treatment, cancer cell migration and invasion ability obviously decreased compared with that cocultured with CAF only (Figure 3A,B). Concomitantly, EMT marker changes caused by CAF were reversed after nab\u2010PTX treatment (Figure 3C,D).Nab\u2010paclitaxel (Nab\u2010PTX) canceled the cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF)\u2010induced cancer cell migration and invasion. A,B, Migration assay (A) and invasion assay (B) for cancer cells cocultured with CAF with or without 5 ng/mL nab\u2010PTX (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, n = 4). Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. C,D, PCR analysis and western blot of E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, and vimentin expression of cancer cells cocultured with CAF with or without 5 ng/mL nab\u2010PTX (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, n = 4). E,F, PCR analysis (E) and ELISA (F) for IL\u20106 expression and secretion of CAF cocultured with cancer cells with or without 5 ng/mL nab\u2010PTX (*significantly different between 2groups, P < .05, n = 4)We showed that coculture with cancer cells or stimulation by cancer cell\u2010cultured medium upregulated CAF IL\u20106 expression, which might correlate with cancer migration and invasion promotion. Therefore, we detected IL\u20106 expression after nab\u2010PTX treatment. After coculture with cancer cells and nab\u2010PTX treatment combination, CAF remarkably decreased IL\u20106 expression and IL\u20106 protein level in cultured medium (Figure 3E,F).To determine whether nab\u2010PTX predominantly acted on CAF to downregulate IL\u20106 expression or on cancer cells to inhibit their ability to stimulate CAF IL\u20106 expression, we treated CAF with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium and nab\u2010PTX simultaneously (nab\u2010PTX1) or nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (nab\u2010PTX2) and then detected their IL\u20106 expression and secretion (Figure 4A). Interestingly, compared with stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (CM) only, IL\u20106 expression and secretion was significantly reduced in CAF treated with nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (Figure 4B,C). This showed that nab\u2010PTX acted on cancer cells to decrease their ability to stimulate CAF IL\u20106 expression. Then, the conditioned medium derived from CAF of nab\u2010PTX1 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX1) and of nab\u2010PTX2 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX2) was used to stimulate cancer cells during a migration and invasion assay. Along with IL\u20106 reduction, the conditioned medium of CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX2 did not increase cancer cell migration and invasion ability (Figure 4D,E). Also, change of EMT markers confirmed that CAF\u2010conditioned medium prepared with nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium had significant effects (Figure 4F,G).Nab\u2010paclitaxel (Nab\u2010PTX) functioned on cancer cells to inhibit cancer\u2010associated fibroblast (CAF) migration and invasion\u2010promoting effect. A, CAF were stimulated with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (CM) and nab\u2010PTX simultaneously (nab\u2010PTX1) or nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (nab\u2010PTX2). B,C, PCR analysis (B) and ELISA (C) for interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) expression and secretion of CAF stimulated with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium and nab\u2010PTX simultaneously (nab\u2010PTX1) or nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium (nab\u2010PTX2) (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, N.S., not significantly different between 2 groups, P > .05; n = 4). D,E, Migration assay (D) and invasion assay (E) for cancer cells stimulated with conditioned medium derived from CAF of nab\u2010PTX1 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX1) or that of nab\u2010PTX2 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX2) (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, N.S., not significantly different between 2 groups, P > .05; n = 4). Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. F,G, PCR analysis and western blot of E\u2010cadherin, N\u2010cadherin, and vimentin expression of cancer cells stimulated with conditioned medium derived from CAF of nab\u2010PTX1 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX1) or that of nab\u2010PTX2 (CAF\u2010CM + nab\u2010PTX2) (*significantly different between 2 groups, P < .05, N.S., not significantly different between 2 groups, P > .05; n = 4)Nab\u2010PTX decreased IL\u20106 secretion of CAF by increasing cancer cell CXCL10 secretionTo detect cytokine secretion profile changes in cancer cells after nab\u2010PTX treatment, we carried out cytokine arrays of cancer cell (Panc\u20101) culture supernatants (Figure S1A,B). CCL2, CCL5, CCL12, IL\u201013, MIF, and PAI showed a decrease after nab\u2010PTX treatment and CXCL10 showed a dramatic increase. It has been reported that CXCL10 has an antifibrosis effect.15 Hence, we considered that cancer cell CXCL10 expression promoted by nab\u2010PTX might decrease CAF IL\u20106 expression and cancer cell migration\u2010promoting ability. We measured CXCL10 expression and secretion of cancer cells after nab\u2010PTX treatment 3 times separately and confirmed that nab\u2010PTX treatment upregulated CXCL10 expression and secretion (Figure 5A,B). CXCL10 antibody was used to neutralize secreted CXCL10 by cancer cells after nab\u2010PTX treatment. After CXCL10 neutralization, nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell supernatant did not impede IL\u20106 secretion of CAF (Figure 5C,D). Subsequently, it did not cancel migration and invasion promotion and EMT marker expression regulation of CAF (Figure 5E\u2010H). Also, the cancer cell supernatant with or without exogenous CXCL10 was used to stimulate CAF, and IL\u20106 expression and secretion of CAF were observed. This showed that exogenous CXCL10 in the cancer cell supernatant could inhibit the expression and secretion of IL\u20106 of CAF (Figure S2A,B).Nab\u2010paclitaxel (Nab\u2010PTX) decreased interleulin\u20106 (IL\u20106) secretion of cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) by increased cancer cell C\u2010X\u2010C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) secretion.

Cancer cell\u2010derived cytokines including transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u2010\u03b2) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) families or microRNAs (mi\u2010RNAs) could promote normal fibroblasts to transform into CAF.18, 19, 20 Also, cancer cells could maintain the CAF phenotype and promote functions such as proliferation, migration, invasion, or angiogenesis.21 In our study, after stimulation with cancer cell\u2010cultured medium, the migration and invasion\u2010promoting function of CAF clearly increased.Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts, the predominant non\u2010parenchymal cells in the tumor stroma, play a key role in tumor\u2010stromal cross\u2010talk. Many studies have shown that isolated CAF can promote proliferation, migration and invasion, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance in many types of cancer including pancreatic adenocarcinoma.22, 23, 24 IL\u20106, as one of the major proinflammatory cytokines secreted by CAF, involves the modulation of growth of pancreatic cancer. It has been confirmed that IL\u20106 is important for the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer.25 After exogenous IL\u20106 stimulation, cancer cells increased vascular endothelial growth factor, neuropilin\u20102, and MMP expression, which correlated with cell proliferation and angiogenesis.26 Therefore, high serum or tumor stroma IL\u20106 concentrations indicate advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis.27 In the present study, cancer cell migration and invasion ability were related to IL\u20106 secretion by CAF. IL\u20106\u2010secreted CAF had migration and invasion\u2010promoting ability but this ability obviously decreased after IL\u20106 antibody neutralization. Also, CAF IL\u20106 expression difference was found between cancer cells and nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cells stimulated according to the difference of migration and invasion\u2010promoting ability.CXCL10 is upregulated after immune and non\u2010immune\u2010mediated tissue injury involving tissue repair and remodeling.28 It has been suggested that CXCL10 is important in regulating the fibrogenesis response. A previous study indicated that CXCL10 knockout mice showed an excessive fibrogenic response to stimulation and exogenous CXCL10 inhibited fibroblast recruitment and subsequent fibrosis.29 Although it is commonly believed that antifibrosis of CXCL10 correlates to inhibit fibroblast migration, the effect of CXCL10 on \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin and IL\u20106 expression to prevent myofibroblast differentiation is also reported.30 In our study, after nab\u2010PTX treatment, cancer cells increase CXCL10 expression, and this CXCL10 might decrease CAF IL\u20106 expression and suppress CAF tumor\u2010promoting ability when the nab\u2010PTX pretreated cancer cell\u2010cultured medium was used to stimulate CAF.Even though the dose of nab\u2010PTX used in the present study was relatively low compared with the clinical setting and the dose of nab\u2010PTX in our study did not decrease cell proliferation, there were already some changes in transcription of cancer cells and inhibition of cancer cells and CAF interaction caused by our dose of nab\u2010PTX. It has been shown that paclitaxel could stabilize microtubules and reduce transcription regulator, such as S100A4, nuclear import to block metastatic\u2010related gene expression in cholangiocarcinoma cells.31 Also, low\u2010dose paclitaxel could increase nuclear factor kappa B expression and nuclear transition which, as a transcription factor, can combine with the CXCL10 promoter and promote CXCL10 expression.32, 33 In our study, we confirmed that low\u2010dose nab\u2010PTX could change the expression of the EMT\u2010related gene along with decreasing cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, CXCL10 expression was increased. Unfortunately, low\u2010dose nab\u2010PTX had no direct effect on CAF during cancer cell medium stimulation.There are some limitations in the present study. The dosage used in our study was not as high as that which is clinically adopted, but even the relatively low dose of CAF had an antitumor effect. The CAF we used in this study is derived from only 1 patient which might limit the external validity of our results. Also, in vivo experiments were not included in this study.In conclusion, our study showed that nab\u2010PTX could stimulate CXCL10 expression of pancreatic cancer cells which inhibited IL\u20106 expression of CAF and decreased cancer cell migration and invasion\u2010promoting ability.CONFLICTS OF INTERESTThis study was funded by Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan).Supporting informationREFERENCESCancer statistics, 2017Drug penetration in solid tumoursPancreatic carcinoma cells stimulate proliferation and matrix synthesis of hepatic stellate cellsPancreatic stellate cells: a dynamic player of the intercellular communication in pancreatic cancerCancer\u2010associated fibroblast exosomes regulate survival and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cellsCancer\u2010associated stromal fibroblasts promote pancreatic tumor progressionFibroblast\u2010mediated drug resistance in cancerPositron emission tomography response evaluation from a randomized phase III trial of weekly nab\u2010paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreasSPARC\u2010independent delivery of Nab\u2010paclitaxel without depleting tumor stroma in patient\u2010derived pancreatic cancer xenograftsSPARC independent drug delivery and antitumour effects of nab\u2010paclitaxel in genetically engineered miceStromal disrupting effects of nab\u2010paclitaxel in pancreatic cancerPancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts display normal allelotypesTransitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states: acquisition of malignant and stem cell traitsIL\u20106/STAT3 plays a regulatory role in the interaction between pancreatic stellate cells and cancer cellsCXCR3\u2010independent actions of the CXC chemokine CXCL10 in the infarcted myocardium and in isolated cardiac fibroblasts are mediated through proteoglycansNab\u2010paclitaxel plus S\u20101 shows increased antitumor activity in patient\u2010derived pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse modelsIncreased antitumor activity, intratumor paclitaxel concentrations, and endothelial cell transport of cremophor\u2010free, albumin\u2010bound paclitaxel, ABI\u2010007, compared with cremophor\u2010based paclitaxelRepurposed drug screen identifies cardiac glycosides as inhibitors of TGF\u2010beta\u2010induced cancer\u2010associated fibroblast differentiationReprogramming of normal fibroblasts into cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts by miRNAs\u2010mediated CCL2/VEGFA signalingIncreased fibrosis and impaired intratumoral accumulation of macromolecules in a murine model of pancreatic cancer co\u2010administered with FGF\u20102Hepatocellular carcinoma cells cause different responses in expressions of cancer\u2010promoting genes in different cancer\u2010associated fibroblastsBreast cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts in hepatocellular carcinomaStat3/Socs3 activation by IL\u20106 transsignaling promotes progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and development of pancreatic cancerIL\u20106 stimulates Th2 type cytokine secretion and upregulates VEGF and NRP\u20101 expression in pancreatic cancer cellsCharacterization of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and high serum interleukin\u20106 levelsCXCL10 and autoimmune diseasesInhibition of pulmonary fibrosis by the chemokine IP\u201010/CXCL10Immunomodulation by mesenchymal stem cells in treating human autoimmune disease\u2010associated lung fibrosisLow dose paclitaxel reduces S100A4 nuclear import to inhibit invasion and hematogenous metastasis of cholangiocarcinomaSabarubicin\u2010 (MEN 10755) and paclitaxel show different kinetics in nuclear factor\u2010kappaB (NF\u2010kB) activation: effect of parthenolide on their cytotoxicityMAPK signaling downstream to TLR4 contributes to paclitaxel\u2010induced peripheral neuropathy"

However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

        "content": "From a murine breast cancer cell line, 4T1, we established a subclone, 4T1.3, which consistently metastasizes to bone upon its injection into the mammary fat pad. 4T1.3 clone exhibited similar proliferation rate and migration capacity as the parental clone. However, the intra-bone injection of 4T1.3 clone caused larger tumors than that of the parental cells, accompanied with increases in fibroblast, but not osteoclast or osteoblast numbers. 4T1.3 clone displayed an enhanced expression of a chemokine, CCL4, but not its specific receptor, CCR5. CCL4 shRNA-transfection of 4T1.3 clone had few effects on its in vitro properties, but reduced the tumorigenicity arising from the intra-bone injection. Moreover, intra-bone injection of 4T1.3 clone caused smaller tumors in mice deficient in CCR5 or those receiving CCR5 antagonist than in wild-type mice. The reduced tumor formation was associated with attenuated accumulation of CCR5-positive fibroblasts expressing connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)/CCN2. Tumor cell-derived CCL4 could induce fibroblasts to express CTGF/CCN2, which could support 4T1.3 clone proliferation under hypoxic culture conditions. Thus, the CCL4-CCR5 axis can contribute to breast cancer metastasis to bone by mediating the interaction between cancer cells and fibroblasts in bone cavity.",

Although hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy have significantly improved efficacy in breast cancer patients, chemotherapy resistance is still a substantial challenge in the face of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), for which hormone therapy is not available. Chemotherapy resistance is becoming increasingly common and involves a variety of mechanisms, including P-glycoprotein-dependent drug efflux, DNA damage and repair, epigenetic changes and apoptosis disorders. In these mechanisms, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are activated fibroblasts, also play an important role in promoting the drug resistance of tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs can lead to chemotherapy resistance in tumor cells by secreting exosomes and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and HGF. CAFs can create obstacles to chemotherapeutic drug delivery. CAFs can lead to leakage in tumor blood vessels and decrease the concentration of intravenous drugs. In addition, CAFs can also increase collagen secretion in solid tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and breast cancer, enhance the density of tumor tissues, reduce vascular density, and pressure the tumor vascular system.Atractylenolide-I (ATL-1) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz [Family: Compositae] that has been applied in anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and antitumor treatments. ATL-1 has antitumor effects on a variety of cancers, including colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer. ATL-1 can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, ATL-1 was found to reduce the dryness of tumor cells and increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. However, the antitumor mechanism of ATL-1, especially the specific mechanism by which it increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, is still unclear and requires further study. ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. So we wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation in tumor microenvironment.Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, is a member of the CCN family. Initially, CTGF was found to promote tissue fibrosis and harden tissue structures. As a secreted protein, CTGF also plays important roles in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. On the one hand, CTGF can promote the proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and metastasis of tumor cells; on the other hand, CTGF can induce chemotherapy resistance. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with lower CTGF expression are more sensitive to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. CTGF can regulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes in tumor cells. CTGF can also induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. CTGF expression is increased in CAFs and negatively correlated with disease-free survival. It has also been reported that CTGF can induce autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by changing the metabolism of CAFs. CAFs have a role in inducing chemotherapy resistance, which explains the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance induction by CTGF from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment.Our previous clinical trials have proven that Huatan Sanjie decoction based on Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz can significantly increase the sensitivity of patients with TNBC to paclitaxel chemotherapy. Therefore, we examined the effect of ATL-I, which is the main component of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, on oncogene expression in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR. We found that ATL-I could significantly reduce the CTGF mRNA level in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. Through functional experiments, we found that ATL- I could significantly reduce the migration of TNBC cells, downregulate the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and increase the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. Therefore, we speculated that ATL- I could play a chemotherapy-sensitizing role by downregulating CTGF.Materials and MethodsChemicals and AntibodiesAtractylenolide-I (AT-I, purity > 98%) and paclitaxel (purity > 98%) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

The relative mRNA levels obtained by qRT-PCR were used to calculate the normalized log2 ratios. The calculation process was as follows:The relative mRNA levels of each gene were calculated by 2\u2013\u0394Ct method, whereThen the log2 ratios (mRNA levels with ATL-1 treatment/mRNA levels without ATL-1 treatment) were as follows:whereIt should be noticed that, each of three biological replicates were performed for the group with ATL-1 treatment and the group without ATL-1 treatment. One of the biological replicate in group without ATL-1 treatment was chose as the standard, then the mRNA level of the other two biological replicates without ATL-1 treatment and the three biological replicates with ATL-1 treatment were all calculated the log2 ratio to this standard. The log2 ratio of the standard to itself was zero.At last, all of the calculated log2 ratios were dealt with Z-score normalization:Gi means the log2 ratio of one of the replicate of gene G. Mean and SD were calculated using the six calculated log2 ratios of gene G (three in group with ATL-1 treatment and three in group without ATL-1 treatment). The normalized log2 ratio was then shown in different colors in the heatmap, which was drawn by Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA). Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. The\u00a0gene-specific primer sequences used in the heatmap are listed in  Supplementary Table S2 .Western BlottingEqual amounts of total protein (20 \u03bcg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes with a pore size of 0.45 \u00b5m (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies against CTGF (1:1000, ab209780), \u03b1-SMA (1:5000, ab124964), FAP (1:1000, ab207178) and \u03b2-tubulin (1:1000, TA-10), and then with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, ZB-2301) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, ZB-2305) antibodies for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate was used to visualize the blots with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system (Hercules, CA, USA). Protein expression levels were quantified with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at an appropriate density, resulting in 80% confluence within 16-24 hours. When the cell confluence reached 70-80%, rinsed the cell layer with PBS and cultured the cells in 5 mL fresh serum-free medium. Supernatants were harvested 24 hours later and used for subsequent ELISA. The secreted CTGF protein levels in the medium were measured with a Human CTGF ELISA kit. The total protein concentration was also examined, and then the concentrations of secreted protein of different samples were normalized to corresponding total protein.Lentiviral TransductionThe pLV-EF1\u03b1-CTGF-CMV-Puro lentiviral plasmid (CTGF-OE), negative control lentiviral plasmid (NC), CTGF-specific shRNAs (sh-CTGF), negative control shRNAs and the according lentivirus were purchased from Shanghai GeneChem Co. (Shanghai, China). Viral titres of approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 infectious units/ml were obtained. Lentivirus infection was performed with polybrene according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates (3-5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and cultured for 16-24 hours. Then, the culture medium was replaced with 480 \u03bcL fresh culture medium and 20\u03bcL polybrene (25\u00d7) per well. Lentivirus was then added to the culture medium at MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 20 (MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells) or 10 (HFF1 and WI-38 cells).Cells were incubated for 16 hours with lentivirus. Then the culture medium containing lentivirus was replaced with 1 mL fresh culture medium per well for the continuous culture. The stably transfected cells were selected by 1 \u03bcg/mL puromycin for 7 days. The sequences of CTGF-specific shRNAs are listed in  Table S3 .Transwell Migration AssayTranswell migration assays were performed using a 24-well Transwell chamber with a pore size of 8 \u00b5m (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105) were maintained in serum-free culture medium in the upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. Cancer cells were allowed to migrate for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, cells that had failed to migrate were removed from the upper chamber with swabs; the remaining cells on the bottom side of the basement membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet. The cells in the lower portion of transwell membrane were counted. A random selection of 3\u20135 fields were photographed and counted under the microscope (Olympus BX40, Tokyo, Japan).Co-Culture ExperimentsCo-culture was carried out as described by Su et\u00a0al.. Co-culture experiments were performed using 6-well or 24-well Transwell chambers with a 0.4-\u00b5m pore size (Costar, San Diego, CA, USA). Taking 6-well Transwell chambers for example, TNBC cells (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the lower chamber with 2.5 mL culture medium, and fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105) were seeded in the upper chamber with 1.5 mL culture medium. DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was used for HS578T and WI-38 cells co-culture experiments. DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS was used for MDA-MB-231 and HFF1 cells co-culture experiments.CCK8 AssayCell Counting Kit-8 was bought from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co. (Beijing, China). Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates or 24-well plates at a density of 1\u00d7104 cells/mL with indicated treatment. Six to eight parallel wells were assigned to each group. At different time points, the culture medium was replaced with 100 \u03bcl fresh medium per 96 well or 500 \u03bcl fresh medium per 24 well. Then, CCK-8 solution (10\u2009\u03bcl per 96 well or 50\u2009\u03bcl per 24 well) was added, followed by incubation for 2\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. A multiplate reader (Flexstation\u00ae 3, Molecular Devices, LLC., San Jose, CA, USA) was used to measure absorbance at 450\u2009nm.Trypan Blue Exclusion AssayAdherent cells were digested with trypsin into a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was mixed with a 0.4% trypan blue solution at a ratio of 9:1. The live and dead cells were counted within 3 minutes. The proportion of live cells was then calculated. In Vivo AssayMDA-MB-231 cells (6 \u00d7 106) were implanted into the fat pads of 6-week-old Balb/c mice. Tumor volumes were measured every three days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula Volume (mm3) = (length \u00d7 height2)/2. When the tumors reached approximately 3\u00a0mm in diameter, paclitaxel treatment was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p. once per week. ATL-1 was given at 50 mg/kg i.p. once daily as described by Li Y et\u00a0al.. After 6 weeks of treatment, all the animals were sacrificed. Partial fresh primary tumors were used for primary culture of fibroblasts as described by Calvo et\u00a0al.. Partial primary tumors and mouse organs were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for subsequent analysis.Primary Culture of Cancer-Associated FibroblastsPrimary culture was carried out as described by Calvo et\u00a0al., with some modifications. Tumor samples were cut into small pieces and digested by collagenase/dispase. Then, 44 \u03bcm nylon meshes were used to remove undigested tissue. After centrifuging at 1000 rpm/min for 10\u00a0min, the filtered cells were collected and then re-suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured in the culture dish. Thirty minutes later, the fibroblasts had already adhered to the culture dish, while other cell types remained in suspension. Afterward, the culture media were changed and fibroblasts were cultured for subsequent experiments.Statistical AnalysisData were assessed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Adobe Illustrator CC 2018 and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were used to represent the data. Student\u2019s t test was used to determine the difference between each two groups. Error bars in the experiments indicate standard deviation (SD). Any values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsATL-1 Inhibited Tumor Cell Migration and Increased the Sensitivity of Tumor Cells to PaclitaxelAs shown in  Figures\u00a01A, B , we found that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 significantly inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays. We chose 50\u03bcM as the ATL-1 concentration for subsequent experiments. To mimic the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HFF1 and WI38 cells), and then examined the growth effects of ATL-1 on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CCK8 assays. We found 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on TNBC cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a01C ,  S1A ). We then examined the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. We found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel for 48 hrs, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was lower than that of TNBC cells cultured alone (-)( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells in co-cultured systems was higher than that of TNBC cells cultured alone ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). However, we found that when TNBC cells were challenged with paclitaxel in co-cultured systems, the inhibition rate of TNBC cells with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment was higher than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01D ,  S1B ), and the proportion of survived TNBC cells with ATL-1 treatment was lower than that of TNBC cells without ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a01E ,  S1C ). These data suggested that ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on TNBC cells in co-culture systems.ATL-1 inhibited tumor cell migration and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. Wound healing (A) and Transwell migration (B) assays showed that 50 \u03bcM and 100 \u03bcM ATL-1 reduced the migratory capacities of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells. (C) CCK8 assays showed that 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 alone had no growth-inhibiting effect on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells). (D) CCK8 assays showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts (HFF1 or WI-38 cells) with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (E) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates CTGF Expression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells and Inhibits Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFTo reveal the potential mechanism by which ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. The normalized log2 ratio and p value for significantly downregulated genes were shown in  Table S1 . We found that the CTGF mRNA level was significantly decreased after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs ( Figure\u00a02A ). qRT-PCR and Western blotting verified the downregulation of CTGF at the mRNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T TNBC cells following ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a02B, C ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a02D ).ATL-1 downregulates CTGF expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell migration via CTGF. (A) Heatmaps of migration-related gene-expressions from MDA-MB-231 qRT-PCR analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with/without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24\u00a0h. Pink and blue colors represent gene expression levels above and below the mean, respectively. (B) qPCR illustrated the downregulation of CTGF mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (C) and ELISA (D) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 compared to without ATL-1 treatment by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Inhibits Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Migration via CTGFWe wondered whether ATL-1 inhibits TNBC cell migration via CTGF. We found that recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) could rescue the downregulation of cancer cell migration by ATL-1 in wound healing assays and Transwell migration assays ( Figures\u00a03A, B ). To further determine the role of CTGF, we overexpressed the expression of CTGF with CTGF-OE lentivirus in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a03C ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a03C ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated in CTGF-OE cells ( Figures\u00a03D, E ). We also knocked down the expression of CTGF with shRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells ( Figure S2A ). We found that the reduction in migration induced by ATL-1 could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs ( Figures S2B, C ). These data further confirmed that CTGF mediated the inhibitory effect of ATL-1 on tumor cell migration.ATL-1 inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell migration via CTGF. Wound healing (A) and transwell migration (B) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were rescued by rCTGF. (C) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF was overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells by CTGF-OE lentivirus. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. Wound healing (D) and Transwell migration (E) assays showed that the reductions in MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cell migration induced by ATL-1 were attenuated in CTGF-OE cells. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Downregulates Fibroblast Expression of CTGF and Inhibits the Ability of Breast Cancer Cells to Transform Fibroblasts Into CAF-Like CellsBecause CTGF is associated with the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, we examined the effect of ATL-1 on CTGF expression in fibroblasts. We found that CTGF mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased by ATL-1 treatment in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figures\u00a04A, B ). ELISA verified the downregulation of the secreted level of CTGF ( Figure\u00a04C ). To mimic fibroblast transformation in the tumor microenvironment, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts for 2 days and then examined the mRNA and protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA. Firstly, we examined the effect of recombinant CTGF (rCTGF) on the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs in co-culture systems. We found that the treatment with rCTGF (higher than 5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 days could significantly increase the mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, and we chose 10 \u03bcg/mL for the subsequence experiments ( Supplementary Figures S3A, B ). Then, we examined the effects of ATL-1 on fibroblasts transformation. We found that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 2 days dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA in co-cultured systems, which could be rescued by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a04D, E ;  Supplementary Figure S3C ).ATL-1 downregulates fibroblast expression of CTGF and inhibits the ability of breast cancer cells to transform fibroblasts into CAF-like cells. (A) qPCR illustrated downregulation of CTGF mRNA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. Western blotting (B) and ELISA (C) illustrated downregulation of the CTGF protein and secreted protein levels of HFF1 and WI-38 cells after treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 for 24 hrs. qRT-PCR (D) demonstrated that treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the mRNA levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. Western blotting (E) demonstrated that co-culture with cancer cells upregulated the protein levels of the CAF markers FAP and \u03b1-SMA in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. Treatment with 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 in the co-culture system for 48 hrs downregulated the protein levels of CAF markers compared with no ATL-1 treatment. rCTGF rescued the downregulation. (-) in (E) represent without ATL-1 and rCTGF treatment. (A\u2013E) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates. Mean \u00b1 SD, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Student\u2019s t test.ATL-1 Increased the Sensitivity of TNBC Cells to Paclitaxel by Downregulating the Expression of CTGF in FibroblastsTo study the role of CTGF in the sensitization of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, we co-cultured TNBC cells and fibroblasts and then examined the effects of ATL-1 and rCTGF on the sensitivity of the tumor cells to paclitaxel by CCK8 assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that the addition of ATL-1 could obviously increase the inhibition rates of TNBC cells in the co-culture systems, which could be attenuated by rCTGF ( Figures\u00a05A ,  S4A ). We then overexpressed CTGF expression with CTGF-OE lentivirus in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts (CTGF-OE), and used the NC lentivirus as the negative control (NC) ( Figure\u00a05B ). After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment ( Figure\u00a05B ). We examined the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel with CCK8 assays and trypan blue exclusion assays. All treatments lasted 48 hrs. We found that when TNBC cells were co-cultured with NC fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were reduced by ATL-1 treatment. While, when TNBC cells were co-cultured with CTGF-OE fibroblasts, the IC50 of paclitaxel and the proportion of survived TNBC cells after paclitaxel treatment were no longer reduced by ATL-1 treatment ( Figures\u00a05C, D ;  Figures S4B, C ). We also knocked down CTGF expression with shRNAs in HFF1 and WI-38 fibroblasts ( Figure S5A ) and found that the ATL-1-driven chemosensitization in co-cultured systems could be attenuated by CTGF-specific shRNAs acting on fibroblasts ( Figures S5B, C ). These data suggest that CTGF secreted by fibroblasts mediates the chemosensitizing effect of ATL-1 on TNBC cells.ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. CCK8 (A) assay showed the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment and rCTGF treatment for 48 hrs. (B) Western blotting demonstrated that CTGF expression was overexpressed in HFF1 and WI-38 cells. After being overexpressed, there was no difference in CTGF expression between with and without ATL-1 treatment. (C) CCK8 showed the IC50 of paclitaxel on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone (\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. (D) Trypan blue exclusion assay showed the live cell counts after paclitaxel treatment on MDA-MB-231 and HS578T cells cultured alone(\u2013) or co-cultured with fibroblasts with or without 50 \u03bcM ATL-1 treatment for 48 hrs. ATL-1 increased the growth-inhibiting effects of paclitaxel in co-culture systems (NC), which was attenuated by the overexpression of CTGF in fibroblasts (CTGF-OE). (A\u2013D) Three technical replicates were performed for each of the three biological replicates.

We found that in model mice bearing subcutaneously inoculated MDA-MB-231 cells, paclitaxel treatment inhibited tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases. ATL-1 dramatically enhanced these inhibitory effects ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). However, ATL-1 alone had no effect on tumor growth and lung and liver micrometastases ( Figures\u00a06A, B ). Western blotting showed that ATL-1 could reduce CTGF protein levels in primary tumors ( Figure\u00a06C ). In addition, qRT-PCR revealed that primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 alone (ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from control tumors (control) ( Figure\u00a06D ). And primary cultured fibroblasts derived from tumors treated with ATL-1 in combination with paclitaxel (paclitaxel+ATL-1) expressed lower mRNA levels of FAP and \u03b1-SMA than fibroblasts from tumors treated with paclitaxel alone (paclitaxel) ( Figure\u00a06D ).Atractylenolide-I sensitizes triple-negative breast cancer to paclitaxel in a mouse model. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were inoculated orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of 6-week-old female Balb/c mice (n = 6).

Long F et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could suppress tumorigenesis in breast cancer by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor 4-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. ATL-1 was found to inhibit melanoma and colorectal cancer cell proliferation via the JAK2/STAT3 or AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Ye Y et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 could induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells via ERK/GSK3beta signaling. Ma L et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could attenuate gastric cancer stem cell traits via the Notch pathway. However, the effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied.We found that ATL-1 could significantly increase the sensitivity to paclitaxel in triple-negative breast cancer in co-cultured systems. Huang JM et\u00a0al. found that ATL-1 sensitized human ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel by blocking activation of the TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway in cancer cells. However, we found that when TNBC cells were cultured alone, ATL-1 was not enough to affect the sensitivity to paclitaxel in TNBC cells. This may be due to the difference in cell types. We are the first to find that ATL-1 could affect chemotherapy sensitivity through fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment. We found that ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast transformation into CAFs. Guo Y et\u00a0al. reported that ATL-1 could repress the myofibroblastic phenotype and fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys by targeting fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD), as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which supports our findings. We found the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 is inseparable from co-cultured with fibroblasts. We speculate that the addition of ATL-1 could downregulate the expression and secretion levels of CTGF, which could inhibit fibroblasts transform to CAF. The change in fibroblasts\u2019 transformation level could alter some proteins or exosomes secreted by fibroblasts, which in turn affects the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel. The verification of this hypothesis needs further experiments. It has been reported that CAFs could induce chemoresistance by secreting IL-6, IL-8, HGF and exosomes, which explains our findings supporting the conclusion that ATL-1 could inhibit chemotherapy resistance via fibroblasts.To explain the biological function of ATL-1 we have discovered, we examined differentially expressed migration-related genes in MDA-MB-231 cells by qRT-PCR after ATL-1 treatment. Firstly we examined the genes that were involved in our past or on-going experiments. As shown in  Figure\u00a02A , most of these genes are classic genes closely related to cell migration. The down-regulation of these classic genes by ATL-1 can prove our observation to a certain extent that ATL-1 inhibits cell migration. In addition, most of these classic genes are associated not only with tumor cell migration but also with chemoresistance of tumor cells. They promote chemoresistance by different mechanisms. Because we are going to study the mechanism of ATL-1 on chemosensitization, the examination of these genes can provide ideas for us. For example, SOX9 is a key transcription factor and related with chemoresistance; HMGB2 is known to bind to DNA structure resulting from cisplatin-DNA adducts and affect the chemosensitivity of cells; CD44 is related with stemness of cancer cells; S100A4 and CTGF are related with fibroblast in tumor microenvironment. We chose CTGF for further study because it might help us to explain the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 from aspect of microenvironment and CAF. The effect of ATL-1 on tumor microenvironment has not been studied. As ATL-1 was reported to inhibit fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and repress fibrosis development in unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys. We wondered whether ATL-1 could inhibit fibroblast activation via CTGF in tumor microenvironment. As CTGF and CAF in tumor microenvironment have successfully explained the chemosensitization function of ATL-1 in the following experiments, we did not further examine other genes by RNA-seq at that moment.We found that the expression of CTGF in TNBC cells and fibroblasts could be reduced by ATL-1, which led to a decrease in cancer cell migration and an increase in chemosensitivity. Several studies have reported that CTGF can promote the migration of tumor cells, which supports our view. Our data also showed that CTGF expression was significantly higher in fibroblasts than in tumor cells ( Figures\u00a02D ,  4C ). This\u00a0also explains, to some extent, why ATL-1 treatment in co-culture systems could significantly increase chemotherapy sensitivity compared with treatment in single-culture systems of tumor cells. As for how the significant reduction of CTGF secretion level in fibroblasts affected the chemosensitivity of TNBC cells, we have the following two hypotheses. On the one hand, ATL-1 can directly affect the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy by reducing the secretion of CTGF by fibroblasts. CTGF has been reported to increase drug resistance to paclitaxel by upregulating survivin expression in human osteosarcoma cells. CTGF can promote chemoresistance in glioblastoma through TGF-\u03b21-dependent activation of Smad/ERK signaling. Even in vivo experiments have shown that CTGF antagonism with the mAb FG-3019 enhances the chemotherapy response in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, but to some extent that we think is more important, CTGF can promote the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs, and CAFs can promote chemotherapy resistance. ATL-1 can inhibit the transformation of fibroblasts into CAFs induced by CTGF and indirectly increase the chemotherapy sensitivity of tumor cells in a co-culture system. CTGF can induce a variety of cells to transform into CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Tsang M et\u00a0al. found that CTGF is required for the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts in a murine model of melanoma. As a downstream effector of the profibrotic molecule TGF-\u03b2, CTGF can promote the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts. All these observations support our findings.CTGF expression was reported to be controlled by TGFB1 signaling in fibroblasts and Hippo-YAP signaling in TNBC cells. In our results, we found that CTGF expression was reduced by ATL-1 in TNBC cells and fibroblasts. But the specific activated receptors and signaling pathways need to be further studied. RNA-seq, KEGG and GO analysis will be need for our further research.Our mice model showed that paclitaxel treatment and paclitaxel combined with ATL-1 treatment could reduce tumor volume and numbers of metastasis. Compared with single paclitaxel treatment, the addition of ATL-1 treatment could further enhance therapeutic effect. This was consistent with our results in vitro. But, we did not see any effect on single ATL-1 treatment on metastasis, though we saw ATL-1 treatment could inhibit TNBC cells migration via CTGF in the in-vitro model. Actually, metastasis is facilitated by at least four essential steps: detachment, migration, invasion and adhesion. These four essential, metastatic steps are inter-related and affected by multi-biochemical events and parameters. Just reducing the migration ability by ATL-1 may not be sufficient to reduce tumor metastasis in vivo models. Paclitaxel can cause the death of tumor cells by disrupting the normal microtubule dynamics required for cell division and vital interphase processes. Paclitaxel can significantly inhibit the growth of primary tumors and metastatic tumors and has been widely used in clinical practice. Although the reduction of CTGF and fibroblasts transformation induced by single ATL-1 treatment were not sufficient to inhibit tumor metastasis, these two steps played key roles in increasing the sensitivity of paclitaxel chemotherapy, and we have seen the enhanced therapeutic effect of the combination therapy in our in vivo models.In summary, our study demonstrated that ATL-1 could inhibit tumor cell migration via downregulation of CTGF in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, ATL-1 reduced the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts and inhibited fibroblast transformation into CAFs. ATL-1 increased the sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel by downregulating the expression of CTGF in fibroblasts. These results indicate that ATL-1 can increase chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and suppress breast cancer metastasis. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ATL-1.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary Material .

One in ten women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime in Western countries. The poor prognosis of patients with breast cancer is related to tumour recurrence and metastasis. Breast cancer is characterized by metastasis to regional lymph nodes, bone marrow, lungs and the liver. Previous studies demonstrated that sites of metastasis are determined not only by the characteristics of neoplastic cells but also by the microenvironment of the specific organs. Organ specific attractant molecules can promote homing of tumour cells to particular sites.Stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 (CXC chemokine ligand-12) is a member of CXC chemokine family, which was initially cloned from murine bone marrow and characterized as a pre-B-cell growth stimulating factor. SDF-1 exerts effects through its cognate receptor CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4), which is the only physiological receptor for SDF-1 and is known to play roles in chemotaxis, haematopoiesis, vasculogenesis and tumour spread and metastasis. It was recently shown that CXCR4 is involved in homing of tumour cells to specific organs and in tumour progression. Muller and coworkers found that SDF-1/CXCR4 plays a critical role in determining the metastatic destination of breast cancer cells. Moreover, they demonstrated that neutralization with a specific monoclonal antibody against CXCR4 effectively inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer cells to the lung or lymph nodes in mice.However, despite the accumulated information on CXCR4, few studies have been conducted to evaluate SDF-1 expression and its prognostic value in patients with breast cancer. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the SDF-1 gene in breast cancer cells on their invasive and migration properties, using a SDF-1 transfection technique. Furthermore, we analyzed SDF-1 expression by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, and its relation with clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes in human breast cancer.Materials and methodMaterialsThe RNA extraction kit and reverse transcription kit were obtained from AbGene Ltd (Epsom, Surrey, UK). PCR primers were designed using Beacon Designer (Palo Alto, CA, USA) and synthesized by Invitrogen Ltd (Paisley, UK). Molecular biology grade agarose and DNA ladder were obtained from Invitrogen. The master mix for routine PCR and quantitative PCR was from AbGene Ltd. Goat anti-human SDF-1 polyclonal antibodies and rabbit anti-human CXCR4 polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Ltd (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Peroxidase conjugated anti-goat and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, England, UK) and a biotin universal staining kit was from Vector Laboratories (Nottingham, England, UK). Matrigel (reconstituted basement membrane) was purchased from Collaborative Research Products (Bedford, MA, USA). A transwell plate equipped with a porous insert (pore size 8 \u03bcm] was obtained from Becton Dickinson Labware (Oxford, UK).Cell lines and culture conditionsThe following human breast cancer cell lines were used: MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, MCF7, BT549 and ZR751 (purchased from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Salisbury, UK). Human foetal lung fibroblast cell line MRC5 (from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures) and human vascular endothelial cell line HECV (from the Biology and Cellular and Molecular Pathology Department, Naples, Italy) were also used. The cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% foetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and at 37\u00b0C in a humid atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide/95% air.Construction of SDF-1 expression cassetteFull-length human SDF-1 cDNA was obtained by amplifying the mRNA from normal human fibroblasts, using RT-PCR with the following primers: sdf1exf1 (5'-atgaacgccaaggtcgtg-3'] and SDF1ExR1 (5'-tcacatcttgaacctcttgtt-3'). The discrete SDF-1 product was subsequently TA cloned into pcDNA4/GFP-NT vector (Invitrogen Ltd), followed by transformation using One-Shot E. coli (Invitrogen Ltd), verification, and amplification. Purified plasmid, or control plasmid, was used to transfect MDA-MB-231 cells by electroporation using an electroporator, EasyJet Plus (Flowgen, Boughton, Kent, England, UK), followed by selection with G418 (Sigma). Stable SDF-1 transfectant (MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+), or stable control plasmid transfectant (MDA-MB-231+/-), was subsequently established and verified.In vitro invasion analysisThis technique was previously reported and modified in our laboratory. Briefly, transwell inserts with 8 \u03bcm pore size were coated with 50 \u03bcg Matrigel and dried, before being rehydrated. Breast cancer cells (20 \u00d7 103) were added to each well. After 96 hours cells that had migrated through the matrix and stuck to the other side of the insert were fixed (4% formalin), stained with 0.5% (weight/volume) crystal violet and counted under a microscope.Migration assayThe migration assay was based on a method established in our laboratories. Confluent cells were first overlaid with light mineral oil and then placed on a stage heated to 37\u00b0C. The cell monolayer was scratched using a fine plastic pipette, creating wounds of approximate 250 \u03bcm in width. These wounds were then continuously monitored using a digital camera and time-lapse video recorder. Images were subsequently obtained at 10-min intervals and analyzed using a motion analysis package (Optimas 6) (Optimas Corporation, Bothell, Washington, USA). The accumulated distance that cells travelled over a period of 10 min was analyzed. More than 20 cells were analyzed in each setting, and data were automatically processed using Excel software.Tissue samplesTissue samples were collected from patients with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy. Breast cancer tissue samples (n = 120) and normal mammary tissue samples (from the same patients but away from tumours, and free from tumour cells, as confirmed by subsequent histological analysis; n = 32) were collected immediately after surgery and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Patients were routinely followed clinically after surgery and details were stored in a database. The median follow-up period was 72 months. Details of histology were obtained from pathology reports (Table 1).RT-PCR and real-time Quantitative PCRFrozen sections of tissues were cut at a thickness of 5\u201310 \u03bcm and kept for immunohistochemistry and routine histology. An additional 15\u201320 sections were mixed and homogenized using a hand-held homogenizer, in ice-cold RNA extraction solution. Total RNA extraction from frozen tissues and culture cells was performed using standard RNA isolation kit. The concentration of RNA was determined using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. Reverse transcription was conducted using a reverse transcription kit with an anchored oligo [dT] primer supplied by AbGene Ltd, using 1 \u03bcg total RNA in a 96-well plate. The quality of cDNA was verified using \u03b2-actin primers (5'-caggaggttgaaggactaaa-3' and 5'-gggatcagttttctttgtca-3').Conventional PCR was performed with specific primers for SDF-1 and CXCR4. Amplication conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. This was followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72\u00b0C. The products were visualized on 2% agarose gel after stain with ethidium brominde.The level of SDF-1 and CXCR4 transcripts from the prepared cDNA was determined using a real-time quantitative PCR, based on Amplifluor technology, modified from a method reported previously. (TCS Biologicals Oxford, England, UK) Briefly, pairs of PCR primers were similarly designed using Beacon Designer software, version 2 (Biosoft International, Palo Alto, California, USA) (primer sequence: sense SDF-1 5'-ttcaggagtacctggagaaa-3', CXCR4 5'-cttcttaactggcattgtgg-3'; antisense SDF-1 5'-actgaacctgaccgtacacctaacactggt-3', CXCR4 5'-actgaacctgaccgtacagtgatgacaaag-3'), but an additional sequence was added to one of the primers. This is known as the Z sequence (5'-actgaacctgaccgtaca-3') which is complementary to the universal Z probe (Intergen Inc, Oxford, UK). The primers used for quantitation of oestrogen receptor (ER) and ER-\u03b2 were as we reported previously (ER; 5'-cctactacctggagaacgag-3' and 5'-ctcttcggtcttttcgtatg-3'; and ER-\u03b2: 5'-aaaagaatcattcaatgaca-3' and 5'-attaacacctccatccaaca-3'). Primers used to quantify CK19 were as previously reported (5'-caggtccgaggttactgac-3' and 5'-actgaacctgaccgtacacactttctgc cagtgtgtcttc-3', respectively).The reaction was carried out using the following: Hot-start Q-master mix (AbGene Ltd); 10 pmol of specific forward primer; 1 pmol reverse primer, which has the Z sequence; 10 pmol of FAMtagged probe (Intergen Inc), and cDNA from ~50 ng of RNA. The reaction was conducted using IcyclerIQ (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, England, UK), which is equipped with an optic unit that allows real-time detection of 96 reactions, under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 12 min and 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. The levels of transcripts were generated from a standard that was simultaneously amplified with the samples.Immunohistochemical staining of SDF-1 proteinsIn the present study, normal breast tissue samples (n = 32) and their respective matched breast tumour samples (n = 32) were used for immunohistochmemical analysis. Tissues were frozen and sectioned at a thickness of 6 \u03bcm using a cryostat. The sections were mounted on SuperFrostPlus microscope slides (Ramond A Lamb, London, England, UK) and were air-dried and then fixed in a mixture of 50% acetone and 50% methanol. The sections were then placed in Optimax wash buffer (San Ramon, California, USA) for 5\u201310 min to rehydrate. Sections were incubated for 20 min in a 0.6% bovine serum albumin blocking solution and were then probed with the primary antibody for 1 hour. After extensive washings in buffer, sections were incubated for 30 min in the secondary biotinylated antibody (Multilink Swine anti-goat and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin; Dako Inc., Angel Drove, Ely, Cambridgeshire, England, UK). After washing, avidin biotin complex (Vector Laboratories) was then applied to the sections followed once more by extensive washings. Diaminobenzidine chromogen (Vector Laboratories) was then added to the sections, which were then incubated in the dark for 5 min. Sections were then counterstained in Gill's haematoxylin and were dehydrated in ascending grades of methanol before clearing in xylene and mounting under a coverslip.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was carried out using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test and the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, survival analysis was using Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis and Cox hazardous proportion analysis, using the SPSS version 11 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsExpression of SDF-1/CXCR4 mRNA in cell lines and in human breast cancer tissuresSDF-1 mRNA was identified in MRC5, MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-436 and breast cancer tissues, but not in other breast cancer cell lines and HECV cells. It has been suggested that the MDA-MB-435 cell line is of melanocyte origin, and MDA-MB-436 was the only SDF-1 positive breast cancer cell line of all the lines tested in the present study. In contrast, CXCR4 mRNA expression was detected in all eight breast cancer cell lines, in MRC5 and HECV cells (Fig. 1), and in breast cancer tissue (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of the SDF-1 transcript revealed that breast tumour tissues had high levels of SDF-1 transcript (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: 195 \u00b1 103 copies) as compared with normal mammary tissues (85.6 \u00b1 54), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.35). To take into account the contribution made by cellularity in mammary tissues, levels of SDF1 were normalized to the level of CK19. Dispite a higher SDF1:CK19 ratio in tumour tissues (39.3 \u00b1 13.6) than in normal breast tissue (30.7 \u00b1 3.97), the difference was not significant (P = 0.84). With respect to ER, those tumours negative for ER had higher levels of SDF-1 (246 \u00b1 138) than did ER-positive tumours (57.9 \u00b1 45.4; P = 0.20). A similar, insignificant trend was seen with ER-\u03b2 (248.0 \u00b1 131 for ER-\u03b2- tumours and 1.3 \u00b1 0.72 for ER-\u03b2+ tumours). The SDF-1:CK19 ratio for ER-negative tumours was 52.7 \u00b1 41.6 and that for ER-positive tumours was 30.8 \u00b1 14.4 (P = 0.62). The ratio was 41.2 \u00b1 17.3 for ER-\u03b2-negative and 8.3 \u00b1 5.1 for ER-\u03b2-positive tumours (P = 0.072).SDF-1 has the potential to promote invasion and migrationMDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells, which stably expressed SDF-1 (Fig. 2a), and MDA-MB-231+/- (stable control plasmid transfectant) and wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells, which were SDF-1 negative, were tested for their invasiveness and migration. MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells exhibited greater invasiveness through Matrigel than did wild-type and MDA-MB-231+/- cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 2b). In addition, the migration speed of MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells was markedly increased compared with the respective controls (Fig. 2c).SDF-1/CXCR4 immunohistochemical staining in human breast cancerImmunohistochemical staining confirmed expression of SDF-1 at the protein level in breast cancer tissue samples. In contrast to the adjacent nonmalignant tissue, we were able to demonstrate heterogeneous but consistent expression of SDF-1 antigen in tumour tissue. Immunohistochemical staining of SDF-1 appeared in most tumour cells and in stromal cells (Fig. 3a,b). As expected, staining of CXCR4 were seen in both normal and tumour cells (Fig. 3c,d), with staining in tumour cells being markedly stronger.SDF-1 expression and lymphatic nodal status, histological types, grades and stagingWe analyzed the levels of SDF-1 in relation to nodal status (Fig. 4a). Node-positive tumours had significantly higher levels of SDF-1 than did node-negative ones. The expression level of SDF-1 tended to be higher in the node-positive group, although there was no statistically significant difference between node-positive and node-negative groups (P = 0.05). The data were further analyzed by dividing node-positive and node-negative tumours into ER-positive and ER-negative groups. For SDF-1 no significant differences between subgroups were observed (ER-/node- versus ER-/node+, P = 0.25; ER-/node- versus ER+/node-, P = 0.57; P values for SDF1:CK19 were 0.27 and 0.32, respectively). No significant difference in SDF-1 was seen between ER-positive/node-negative and ER-positive/node-positive subgroups (P = 0.24; for SDF1:CK19 P = 0.27). Similarly, when node-positive and node-negative tumours were subdivided into ER-\u03b2-positive and ER-\u03b2-negative subgroups, no significant difference was seen.We examined expression of SDF-1 relative to tumor types, grade and staging (Table 2). There was a trend in the differences in SDF1 expression between tumour grades, in that grade 3 and grade 2 tumours tended to have higher SDF1 levels than did grade 1 tumours, but this was not statistically significant. There were no significant relations between expression level of SDF-1 and tumor type and stage.SDF-1 expression correlated with prognosis and long term survivalThe expression level of SDF-1 correlated with clinical outcome; patients with local recurrence (P = 0.05) and those who died from breast cancer (P = 0.03) had signfiantly higher levels of SDF-1 transcript (Fig. 4b). Those patients with metastasis and local recurrence, and who died from breast cancer had significantly higher levels of SDF-1 than did the disease-free group (P = 0.01; Fig. 4c).To determine whether SDF-1 transcript levels were associated with long-term survival, we divided patients into those with high levels (n = 79) and those with low levels (n = 41) of SDF-1. The cutoff point was determined using the Nottingham Prognostic Index, and was set at the level at which patients had moderate prognoses (Nottingham Prognostic Index 3.4\u20135.4). As shown in the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve (Fig. 5), high levels of SDF-1 significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (mean survival 94.1 months [95% confidence interval 65.4\u2013122.9 months] versus 143.6 months [95% confidence interval 135.2\u2013152.0 months] months for those with low levels of SDF-1; P = 0.001; Fig. 5a). Further analysis taking tumour grade into account was not possible because the sample number in each subgroup was too small. Similarly, high SDF-1 levels were associated with reduced incidence-free survival (P = 0.035 by Cox proportion analysis; Fig. 5b).DiscussionChemokines are a family of small molecular weight proteins (8\u201310 kDa) that are classified into four distinct groups, depending on the positioning of the cysteine motif at the NH2 terminus. The family members include CXC, CC, C and CXXXC chemokines. The specific effects of chemokines on their target cells are mediated by members of a family of seven-transmembrane-spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors.SDF-1 is a member of the CXC subfamily of chemokines and its receptor is CXCR4. SDF-1 is constitutively expressed in various organs including bone, lung, liver, brain, thymus and lymph nodes, but SDF-1 is mainly produced by stromal cells, such as osteoblasts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the bone marrow. Despite numerous studies on CXCR4 in breast cancer, reports on SDF-1 in human breast cancer are limited.In the present study the expression of CXCR4 was detected in various cell lines and in malignant and nonmalignant breast tissues, but SDF-1 expression was only observed in two out of the eight breast cancer cell lines and in the fibroblast cell line MRC5. These results indicate that certain breast cancer cells co-express SDF-1 and CXCR4, which may act as a potential autocrine mechanism in breast cancer. We have reported that the fibroblast cell line, MRC5, strongly expressed SDF-1. Furthermore, in the present study immunohistochemical staining of SDF-1 was apparent in most tumour cells and in stromal cells. Collectively, from the results, we suggest that SDF-1 in breast cancer is produced by both tumour cells and stromal cells. The other potential source is the infiltrated immune cells, which frequently express CXCR4 and SDF1. The present study did not examine the proportion of these cells that produced SDF1 or the degree of expression, which would be an interesting focus for future studies.The present study provides strong evidence that, when the SDF-1/CXCR4 complex existed (i.e. in MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells, which expressed both SDF-1 and CXCR4), breast cancer cells exhibited significant increases in invasiveness and faster migration. These findings suggest that breast cancer cells that co-express SDF-1 and CXCR4 may be more aggressive. In the present study we were unable to transfect fibroblasts with the current bacterial vector because no fibroblasts subsequently survived the electroporation and genetic marker selection process. It will be useful to develop viral expression for the purpose for future work. In addition, high levels of SDF-1 expression tended to be present in grade 3 and grade 2 tumors as compared with grade 1 tumours, further supporting the contention that breast cancer cells that express high levels of SDF-1 are more invasive.Recently, studies implicated CXCR4 in chemotaxis, invasiveness and metastasis of tumours, particularly in metastasis of breast cancer, in an organ-specific manner. Muller and coworkers found CXCR4 to be highly expressed in breast cancer cells, malignant breast tumours and metastases. On the other hand, peak levels of CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)12 occurred in those organs that represent the initial destinations of breast cancer metastasis (i.e. lymph nodes, lung, liver and bone marrow). Furthermore, neutralizing the interaction between CXCL12 and CXCR4 significantly impaired metastasis to regional lymph nodes and lung in mice. Other reports have also shown that the SDF-1/CXCR4 biological axis is involved in regulating metastasis of tumours. In the present study we found that that node-positive tumours had significantly higher levels of SDF-1 than did node-negative tumors, suggesting that SDF-1 may be involved in the lymph node metastatic process. Given that lymph node metastasis directly affects the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, we propose that SDF-1, via the CXCR4 pathway, is potentially a marker of nodal involvement. It was recently reported that SDF-1 can act as a direct target for ER-\u03b1 in breast cancer cells (e.g. MCF-7 cells). In the present study it is noteworthy that EF-negative and ER-\u03b2-negative tumours tended to have higher levels of SDF-1. Although differences between these subgroups were not statistically significant, the trend, together with the in vitro studies, indicate that this link warrants further investigation. It is also noteworthy that SDF-1 expression in mammary tissues was primarily confined to stromal cells and, to some degree, cancer cells. We did not observe SDF-1 staining in vascular endothelial cells, HECV, and in vascular endothelial cells in the tissues \u2013 observations echoed by other studies. This finding indicates that paracrine regulation may be the main pathway in breast cancer but that autocrine pathways may also exist. Secretion and production of SDF-1 are regulated by other factors. For example, expression of SDF-1 is decreased by IL-1, tumour necrosis factor and inflammation, whereas oestradiol can induce the production and secretion of SDF-1 in breast cancer cells. On the other hand, tumour cells exposed to high concentrations of SDF-1 induce reduction in CXCR4 expression. Furthermore, vascular edothelial grwoth factor can also induce CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cells. Factors contributing to over-expression of SDF-1 in breast cancer thus warrant further investigation.Finally, we demonstrated a significant correlation between SDF-1 expression and overall and disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer. The high level of SDF-1 expression suggests that there is a high likelihood of node metastasis, local recurrence and death from breast cancer in these patients. We and others found the expression pattern of CXCR4 to be significantly correlated with the degree of lymph node metastases but not with haematogenous metastases. Therefore, SDF-1, together with its receptor CXCR4, may have potential value when assessing long-term clinical outcome in breast cancer.ConclusionThe present study demonstrated that breast cancer cells that express SDF-1, and therefore that have an active SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway, are more invasive and motile, thus have a more aggressive phenotype. In clinical breast cancers, and supported by data from cell lines, we found that SDF-1 appears to exist primarily in stromal cells and, to some degree, in breast cancer cells. That levels of SDF-1 are significantly correlated with nodal status, recurrence and, most notably, both overall and disease-free survival indicates that SDF-1 \u2013 and indeed the SDF-1 receptor complex \u2013 have strong predictive value in assessing long-term clinical outcome.AbbreviationsCXCL = CXC chemokine ligand; CXCR = CXC chemokine receptor; ER = oestrogen receptor; RT-PCR = reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SDF = Stromal cell derived factor.Authors' contributionsHK carried out in vitro testing and data analysis, and prepared the manuscript.

CAFs can modulate drug response by different mechanisms including effects on tumour physiology which regulate tumour drug uptake or paracrine signalling altering cancer cell drug sensitivity 2, 3, 4. CAF\u2010derived markers, such as caveolin, stromal phospho\u2010Erk (pErk), and stroma\u2010derived gene signatures have been linked to sensitivity to chemotherapy and endocrine treatment 5, 6, 7.The PDGF family of growth factors, acting through PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 tyrosine kinase receptors, act as important regulators of CAFs 8, 9. Previous studies have demonstrated that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is linked to shorter survival in population\u2010based breast and prostate tumour collections 10, 11. Potential impact of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive fibroblasts on drug sensitivity is suggested by mechanistic studies, which have demonstrated that PDGFR\u2010signalling in fibroblasts can regulate treatment efficacy by controlling tumour drug uptake in a manner involving regulation of tumour interstitial fluid pressure 12, 13.Tamoxifen treatment represents a major component of clinical management of early breast cancer. Improved methods for identification of responsive patients remain a critical issue. Experimental and correlative studies have suggested a role for CAF\u2010derived markers as biomarkers for tamoxifen benefit 14, 15, 16.This study extends these earlier findings by analyses of the potential of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 as a tamoxifen\u2010sensitivity biomarker through analyses of two randomised study\u2010derived breast cancer collections.Material and methodsCohort 1Premenopausal patients with stage II (pT1pN1, pT2pN0, pT2pN1) primary breast cancer (n\u2009=\u2009564) were randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, in the SBII:2 multicentre trial 17. Radiotherapy was delivered after breast conserving therapy and in patients with axillary lymph node metastases; chemotherapy and ovarian suppression was administered to <2% (nine patients). Median follow\u2010up time was 13.6 years for patients without any event. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks were retrieved from 500/564 patients and a tissue micro array (TMA) with two individual cores was constructed 17. Assessment of ER, PR and HER2 were performed according to clinical protocols 18. For ER\u2010 and PR\u2010status the clinically used cut\u2010point of more than 10% was used.Cohort 2The Stockholm tamoxifen trial included a cohort of 1780 postmenopausal breast cancer patients with node negative disease and a tumour size not exceeding 30 mm, randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment, irrespective of hormone receptor status. Radiotherapy was administered to patients receiving breast\u2010conserving therapy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given in this group of patients. The trial has previously been described in more detail 19. TMAs with three individual cores were constructed from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumours from 912 patients. The assessments of ER, PR and HER2 with immunohistochemistry have been previously described 20.ImmunohistochemistryPDGFR\u03b2 IHC for the pre\u2010menopausal TMA series was performed as described earlier 21. The post\u2010menopausal TMA series was immunohistochemically stained for PDGFR\u03b2 using the anti\u2010PDGFR\u03b2 antibody (#3169, 1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) diluted in antibody diluent (Roche) in the Ventana system (Roche) with the Omnimap kit (5266548001, Roche). The secondary anti\u2010rabbit antibody was used according to manufacturer's instructions (5269679001, Roche). For antigen retrieval high pH buffer was used (T6455, Sigma Aldrich). After staining in the Ventana autostainer samples were dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95, 99%) and xylene and mounted using PERTEX (00871, Histolab). TMAs were then scanned at the tissue profiling facility at SciLifeLab, Uppsala University and pictures taken with the Aperio ImageScope software (v.11.2.0.780, Leica Biosystems). Final scores (0\u20133) were derived from two independent readings from JP and CS blinded to outcome data. In cases of dis\u2010concordance between readings (around 10%) slides were re\u2010visited for new consensus\u2010scoring. Cohort 1 was made with two cores/tumour, whereas cohort 2 was made up of three cores/tumour. Mean\u2010values for individual cores of each tumour were used for subsequent correlation and survival\u2010analyses.Statistical analysesThe association of PDGFR\u03b2 with other clinicopathological factors was evaluated using the \u03c72\u2010test. Time for follow\u2010up was defined as the time from randomisation until the first event, loco\u2010regional recurrence, distant recurrence, or death due to breast cancer. Survival curves and probabilities of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox hazard regression analysis.ResultsAssociations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological characteristics of early breast cancerTMAs from tumours of two different randomised studies on tamoxifen benefit in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal women 18, 19, was subjected to PDGFR\u03b2 IHC analyses and scored as previously described (Figure 1) 10, 11.Tumour stromal PDGFR\u03b2 immunohistochemical staining in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.

In this group, 65% of cases displayed high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression, whereas 42% of the post\u2010menopausal cases displayed high levels of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (Table 1).Clinico\u2010pathological characteristics and PDGFR\u03b2 status in the pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal cohortsPre\u2010menopausal patients stage II\tPost\u2010menopausal patients\t \t\t\tPDGFR\u03b2 n (%)\t\t\t\tPDGFR\u03b2 n (%)\t\t \tn\t<3+\t3+\tSignificance\tn\t<3+\t3+\tSignificance\t \tAll\t360\t127 (35)\t233 (65)\t\tAll\t528\t306 (58)\t222 (42)\t\t \tNode status\t\t\t\t\tNode status\t\t\t\t\t \tN0\t108\t34 (27)\t74 (32)\t\tN0\t528\t\t\t\t \tN+\t251\t93 (73)\t158 (68)\tp\u2009=\u20090.46\tN+\t0\t\t\t\t \tTumour size\t\t\t\t\tTumour size\t\t\t\t\t \t\u226420 mm\t128\t44 (35)\t84 (36)\t\t\u226420 mm\t385\t213 (71)\t172 (80)\t\t \t>20 mm\t231\t83 (65)\t148 (64)\tp\u2009=\u20090.77\t>20 mm\t132\t88 (29)\t44 (20)\tp\u2009=\u20090.023\t \tER status\t\t\t\t\tER status\t\t\t\t\t \tER+\t204\t72 (65)\t132 (70)\t\tER+\t393\t221 (74)\t172 (78)\t\t \tER\u2212\t97\t39 (35)\t58 (30)\tp\u2009=\u20090.41\tER\u2212\t127\t78 (26)\t49 (22)\tp\u2009=\u20090.31\t \tPgR status\t\t\t\t\tPgR status\t\t\t\t\t \tPgR+\t203\t67 (65)\t136 (71)\t\tPgR+\t236\t136 (49)\t100 (50)\t\t \tPgR\u2212\t241\t36 (35)\t56 (29)\tp\u2009=\u20090.49\tPgR\u2212\t241\t140 (51)\t101 (50)\tp\u2009=\u20090.92\t \tHER2 status\t\t\t\t\tHER2 status\t\t\t\t\t \tHER2\u2212\t226\t77 (82)\t149 (85)\t\tHER2\u2212\t420\t245 (87)\t175 (85)\t\t \tHER2+\t43\t17 (18)\t26 (15)\tp\u2009=\u20090.49\tHER2+\t69\t38 (13)\t31 (15)\tp\u2009=\u20090.61\t \tIn the post\u2010menopausal cohort a significant association (p\u2009=\u20090.023) was detected between high PDGFR\u03b2 expression and small tumour size (Table 1). No significant association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression and clinico\u2010pathological features were detected in the pre\u2010menopausal group.Impact of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression on RFS in tamoxifen\u2010treated ER+ breast cancerA set of analyses, restricted to ER+ cases, were performed which compared treatment effects in pre\u2010 and post\u2010menopausal subsets defined by stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status.As shown in Figure 2A, a significant benefit of tamoxifen treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.026), measured by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses of RFS, was detected in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group. Strikingly, this significant treatment benefit was not seen in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group. This differential effect of tamoxifen in the two marker\u2010defined patient sub\u2010groups was also seen in Cox regression analyses where treatment was associated with a significant HR in the low/moderate PDGFR\u03b2\u2010expressing pre\u2010menopausal group (HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)), but not in the high PDGFR\u03b2 expressing group (HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)).(A) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.40 (95% CI 0.18\u20130.90)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.84 (95% CI 0.49\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with more than 10% expression of ER in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort. (B) Kaplan\u2010Meier graphs showing recurrence free survival in the stromal PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate (0\u20132+, left panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (0.23\u20130.73)) and high (3+, right panel, RFS: HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (0.31\u20131.42)) groups treated or not with tamoxifen restricted to cases with >75% expression of ER in the post\u2010menopausal cohort.Initial analyses of the complete post\u2010menopausal cohort yielded results with a trend of reduced tamoxifen benefit in the subset with high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 expression (data not shown). Based on findings from earlier meta\u2010analyses that tamoxifen benefit is most prominent in cases with high ER expression novel analyses were performed on the subset of the post\u2010menopausal cohort with more than 75% ER\u2010positive cells (290 cases out of 393). Interestingly, analyses of this sub\u2010group yielded results similar to those seen in the pre\u2010menopausal cohort with significant tamoxifen\u2010benefit, determined both by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses and Cox hazard regression analyses, detected in the PDGFR\u03b2 low/moderate group (HR\u2009=\u20090.41 (95% CI 0.23\u20130.73)), but not in the PDGFR\u03b2 high group (HR\u2009=\u20090.67 (95% CI 0.31\u20131.42)) (Figure 2B).Together these analyses thus indicate that high stromal PDGFR\u03b2 is a marker for reduced benefit of tamoxifen.DiscussionIn contrast to the majority of studies analysing factors associated with benefit of tamoxifen this study describes previously un\u2010recognised associations between a tumour stroma marker and tamoxifen benefit.Support for the notion that stromal fibroblasts can impact on efficacy of drugs targeting malignant cells, have been presented from analyses of series of cases not derived from randomised studies 6, 7. The earlier analyses of the pre\u2010menopausal cohort of the present study which identified pERK as a marker associated with tamoxifen efficacy, is to our knowledge the only other study which have demonstrated associations between a fibroblast\u2010marker and treatment efficacy based on analyses of randomised studies 5. The present findings thus represent a significant addition in the efforts to translate and consolidate pre\u2010clinical findings by analyses of well\u2010annotated clinical samples.The present study identifies associations between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit. Earlier studies have shown that stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status is largely independent from stroma abundance in general or stromal \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin\u2010positivity 10, 22. These findings therefore suggest that the detected association is not related to stroma abundance but rather reflects more specific biology of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells.This study does not address if the detected association between stromal PDGFR\u03b2 and tamoxifen benefit reflects a direct involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 signalling in tamoxifen effects, or rather is related to other signalling effects of PDGFR\u03b2\u2010positive stromal cells. Concerning the former, findings from model studies have demonstrated effects of stromal PDGFR\u03b2 on tumour drug uptake 13, 23, 24. Paracrine signalling from fibroblasts have also been shown to directly affect drug efficacy 2, 25, 26. Previous experiments have indeed demonstrated tamoxifen\u2010protective effects by co\u2010cultured fibroblasts in tissue culture models 14, 15, 16. According to preliminary studies this effect is not related to PDGFR\u03b2 status of fibroblasts, since also fibroblast with down\u2010regulation of PDGFR\u03b2 displayed a protective effect (data not shown). The clinical associations therefore appear more likely to be related to PDGFR\u03b2\u2010controlled drug exposure. Future studies could explore this possibility be measuring tamoxifen uptake, or ER activity, in tumour samples with known stromal PDGFR\u03b2 status from tamoxifen treated cases.Both cohorts represent randomised clinical trials with long time of follow\u2010up, of importance as patients with ER\u2010positive breast cancer frequently experience late relapses. With few exceptions the patients received no other systemic treatment than tamoxifen. A limitation is that the study is retrospective and at the time when the trials were implemented less women than today had breast conserving surgery. Type of surgery had however no influence on the results (data not shown).Based on the results from the present study it seems highly appropriate to integrate fibroblast\u2010related markers, in general, and PDGFR\u03b2, specifically, in future prospective efforts to identify tamoxifen\u2010benefit biomarkers.Author contributionsAll authors provided substantial contributions, were involved in preparation of the manuscript and approved the final version Janna Paulsson: data collection, data analyses, manuscript writing; Lisa Ryd\u00e9n: conception of study, data analyses, manuscript writing; Carina Strell: data collection, data analyses; Oliver Frings: data analyses; Nicholas P.

Although traditional therapies including surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy have ameliorated OC prognosis, the occurrence of resistance to platinum, relapse, and metastasis still claim the lives of the majority of patients. The notorious prognosis of OC and the painfully slow progression of counteracting OC call for the development of novel therapeutic alternatives.OC is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity that has long impeded optimizing the treatment of patients with this disease. Recently, whole-genomic analyses have revealed that homologous recombination (HR) deficiency is a prevalent signature in high-grade serous OC. Cancers with defective HR have been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) by inducing synthetic lethality. This improved understanding of the molecular characterization of OC has contributed to incorporating PARPis into the management of OC. It is estimated that >50% of OC patients likely benefit from PARPis. Among PARPis, olaparib (Ola) was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat relapsed high-grade serous OC with germline BRCA1/2 mutations after progression to at least three prior lines of chemotherapy and has recently been approved for first-line maintenance treatment. While PARPis have reshaped the landscape of OC management and clinical challenges, including acquired resistance in the overwhelming majority of patients, the paucity of biomarkers to define populations who can benefit from PARPis, and potential combination therapies to expand the applications of PARPis, constantly drive ongoing investigations. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding this targeted therapy is confined to tumor cells and remains insufficient in the tumor microenvironment (TME).The TME, encompassing tumor cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM), has attracted much attention for its crucial role in tumor progression. There is increasing evidence revealing that conventional and targeted anticancer therapies could modulate the TME. Traditional chemotherapy destroys subsets of cancer cells and simultaneously activates the stroma to promote cancer recurrence and metastasis. In addition to eliminating HR-deficient tumors, PARPis could influence noncancerous cells such as by inducing genomic instability in normal cells. PARPis have also been reported to participate in the development of tumor immunosuppression, resulting in preclinical combinatory use of PARPis and immunomodulators (e.g., programmed cell death protein-1/programmed cell death ligand-1 inhibitors) in breast cancer and OC. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the dominant resident cells in the TME and have versatile functions, including matrix deposition and remodeling, extensive reciprocal signaling interactions with cancer cells, and crosstalk with infiltrating leukocytes. In confrontation with traditional chemotherapy, CAFs can be activated, which alters their features and enables them to fuel cancer progression. The extrapolation that PARPis also engage in modulating the TME, especially CAFs, is reasonable, but supporting evidence is sparse.In this study, we aimed to investigate how PARPis modulate stromal fibroblasts in OC. We observed that stromal fibroblasts were not susceptible to PARPis. Conversely, stromal fibroblasts were activated after long-term exposure to PARPis. In addition, we uncovered that PARPi-challenged fibroblasts displayed a unique secretory profile, where CCL5 was the most prominently upregulated. We also demonstrated that C-C chemokine motif ligand 5 (CCL5) is responsible for maintaining CAF activation, and neutralizing CCL5 could attenuate PARPi-induced CAF activation in vitro and in both BRCA1/2-wild type and BRCA1/2-mutant xenograft models and boost the tumor inhibitory effect of PARPis. Importantly, the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway is involved in regulating CCL5 secretion in PARPi-primed CAFs. Our results addressed the side effects of PARPis on the TME of OC, and effective blockade of these side effects could augment the efficacy of PARPis with the current therapeutic regimen.ResultsOC stromal fibroblasts are inherently not vulnerable to PARPisOC stromal fibroblasts are inherently not vulnerable to PARPis.a, b OC cell lines (SKOV3, OVCAR3, OVCAR8, A2780, OV90, and SW626), breast cancer cell line HCC1937, and CAFs (MRC5-CAFs and four primary CAFs) were treated with a range of concentrations of Ola or Nira for 72\u2009h and were then assayed using CCK-8 for cell viability and IC50. c, d Representative microphotographs and the quantification of RAD51 and \u03b3-H2AX foci formed in MRC5-CAFs upon exposure to 30\u2009\u03bcM Ola or 20\u2009\u03bcM Nira for the indicated periods.

In contrast to tumor cells, mutations are not commonly found in stromal fibroblasts. To evaluate the sensitivity of cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts to PARPis, five human BRCA1/2-wild type OC cell lines, SKOV3, OVCAR3, A2780, OVCAR8, and OV90; one strain of BRCA1/2-mutant OC cell line, SW626; and one strain of BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer cell line, HCC1937; MRC5-CAFs; and four other primary CAFs were exposed to various doses of PARPis. Representative immunofluorescence images identifying the CAFs by staining the traditional CAF marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a. Ola and niraparib (Nira) were chosen for their recognized effects in variant OC clinical trials. The results showed that the IC50 values of PARPis in fibroblasts were generally higher than those in tumor cell lines, except for HCC1937 cells that did not respond to Ola as previously reported (Fig. 1a, b). Then we analyzed the expression patterns of HR-related signatures in the tumoral and stromal compartments of OC in the microdissected ovarian profile GSE 40595 (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and found that genes such as PTEN and ATM mediating PARPi resistance were highly expressed in the OC stroma. Next, dual immunofluorescence of the DNA damage marker \u03b3-H2AX and the double-strand break repair marker RAD51 were dynamically evaluated in fibroblasts exposed to sublethal concentrations of Ola (30\u2009\u03bcM) and Nira (20\u2009\u03bcM), respectively (Fig. 1c, d). The foci of \u03b3-H2AX were detected at the earliest time point of 24\u2009h after treatment and continued to increase until 48\u2009h. From 48\u2009h, the number of \u03b3-H2AX foci began to decline until they were not detectable at 72\u2009h, in line with the dynamic alteration of G2/M cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). However, for RAD51, we observed that its foci number increased with exposure time until a plateau period at 48\u2009h but never dropped. Altogether, these data demonstrate that stromal fibroblasts are relatively insensitive to PARPis due to their competent HR function and timely escape of cell cycle arrest.PARPis promote the activation of OC stromal fibroblasts in vitroPARPis promote the activation of OC stromal fibroblasts in vitro.a Hierarchical clustering analysis results of RNA-seq in the PARPi-treated primary CAFs and control groups. b, c Gene ontology (GO) and GSEA showing significant enrichment for genes encoding ECM processes and signatures representing CAF activation in Ola-treated CAFs. d GSEA-derived heatmap showing the relative mRNA expression of the stroma activation signature genes. e Representative photographs of the cellular cytoskeleton by F-actin staining in MRC5-CAFs and primary CAFs after treatment with PARPis and their corresponding controls.

To explore the adaptive responses of stromal fibroblasts under PARPi stress, we performed RNA-seq analysis in primary CAFs before and after treatment with PARPis. There were 884 and 2631 significantly altered genes in the Ola and Nira-treated groups, respectively (Fig. 2a). The gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the upregulated genes were mainly related to extracellular regions and ECM components (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results showed that PARPis increased the stromal activation degree and the transcription of the most common CAF marker \u03b1-SMA (also known as ACTA2) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Quantitative real time\u2013PCR (qRT-PCR) verified the increased transcription of several stromal-associated genes, including \u03b1-SMA and COL6A1 (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Thus, we postulated that PARPis could promote stromal fibroblast activation. To further verify our postulation in vitro, using immunofluorescence, we discovered that PARPi-challenged fibroblasts presented a more stretched stellate morphology (Fig. 2e). Immunoblotting revealed that \u03b1-SMA expression was obviously improved following PARPi treatment (Fig. 2f, g and Supplementary Fig. 2e). Additionally, collagen contraction assays showed that fibroblasts treated with PARPis displayed a notably increased capacity to contract ECM (Fig. 2h, i and Supplementary Fig. 2f). The above findings suggested that PARPis exerted a pro-activation role in vitro in stromal fibroblasts.PARPis promote the activation of OC stromal fibroblasts in vivoPARPis promote the activation of OC stromal fibroblasts in vivo.a The schematic diagram of subcutaneous tumor models evaluating the effect of Ola or Nira on OC stroma in vivo. b Representative images and weight quantification of subcutaneous tumors from mice (n\u2009=\u20098) bearing SKOV3, OVCAR8, HCC1937, and OV90 cells in the control and Ola or Nira-treated groups. c\u2013f Representative photographs and quantification of Masson\u2019s trichrome and picrosirius red staining showing the contents of stromal and collagen deposition in SKOV3, OVCAR8, HCC1937, and OV90 xenografts.

Consistent with previous reports and the above Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays (Fig. 1a, b), PARPis showed evident role in inhibiting tumor growth while OV90 exhibited less sensitivity to Nira than other tumor cell lines (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, Masson\u2019s trichrome and picrosirius red staining indicated that the tumors in the PARPi treatment group presented a more significant enrichment of stromal components and a robust increase in collagen abundance compared with those in the control groups (Fig. 3c\u2013g). In addition, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of \u03b1-SMA was more substantial in tumors exposed to PARPis (Fig. 3h\u2013j). Although PARPi-induced killing effect on tumor cells might contribute to the relative increase of the stromal component, desmoplastic histological characteristics, such as increased interstitial spaces, excessive ECM deposition, and obvious derangement of stromal cells, suggested that PARPis exerted a pro-activation role in stromal fibroblasts in both BRCA1/2-wild type and BRCA1/2-mutant xenograft models.CCL5 secretion increases upon PARPi stimulation and correlates with the activation of OC stromal fibroblastsCCL5 secretion increases upon PARPi stimulation and correlates with stromal activation.a, b GSEA showing significant enrichment of the inflammatory response and cytokine activity signature in the Ola-treated CAFs. c, d Cytokine profiles from control MRC5-CAFs and MRC5-CAFs primed with either 30\u2009\u03bcM Ola or 20\u2009\u03bcM Nira for 72\u2009h.

Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m., *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01; ***p\u2009<\u20090.001.Numerous studies have revealed that stromal fibroblasts exposed to cancer-targeted genotoxic agents resulted in significant upregulation of inflammatory factors or cytokines, which in turn promoted the proliferation, invasion, and resistance of cancer cells. In our study, GSEA showed that PARPis also increased the degree of inflammatory response and the cytokine secretion activity of OC primary fibroblasts (Fig. 4a, b). To clarify these specific inflammatory cytokine secretion alterations, we detected conditioned medium (CM) from MRC5-CAFs before and after PARPi treatment using a human inflammatory cytokine array (Fig. 4c). A total of 10 cytokines were significantly increased (fold change >1.5) in CM from Ola-primed MRC5-CAFs, and 9 cytokines were increased in CM from Nira-primed MRC5-CAFs (Fig. 4d). Among these altered cytokines, five of the most upregulated cytokines, CCL5, MIP-3\u03b1, MCP3, CCL11, and ENA-78, were shared by both PARPis (Fig. 4e). The GSEA results of our RNA-seq data showed that CCL5 was elevated in the PARPi-treated group and was most relevant to smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation (Fig. 4f, g). The single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) results of public data demonstrated that CCL5 mRNA expression was positively related to the stromal activation score as well as \u03b1-SMA, FAP, and FSP1 expression (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). PARPi treatment increased intracellular CCL5 expression and CCL5 secretion in primary CAFs (Fig. 4i\u2013k). However, negligible induction of CCL5 expression in cancer cells was observed (Supplementary Fig. 3c\u2013f). Simultaneously, we confirmed that CCL5 was significantly upregulated in the tumoral stroma of both BRCA1/2-wild type and BRCA1/2-mutant xenografts after PARPi treatment (Fig. 4l\u2013n and Supplementary Fig. 3h). It is worth mentioning that not only more positive area of CCL5 along with more stroma proportion but also increased intensity of CCL5 staining in the stromal area could be observed in PARPi-treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. 3g, h). Therefore, IHC score, synthetically estimating both the positive area and staining intensity, can be more appropriate than quantification of positive area. The above results indicated that CCL5 secretion increases upon PARPi stimulation and probably correlates with stromal activation.Autocrine CCL5 is required for PARPi-induced activation of OC stromal fibroblastsCCL5 is required for PARPi-induced stromal fibroblast activation.a Immunoblotting of \u03b1-SMA in primary CAFs after exogenous CCL5 administration.

To identify whether CCL5 was involved in PARPi-induced stromal fibroblast activation, we performed a series of experiments. First, immunoblotting revealed that exposure of stromal fibroblasts to recombinant CCL5 resulted in a continuous increase in \u03b1-SMA expression (Fig. 5a). The CCL5 neutralizing antibody significantly hampered the PARPi-induced activation of stromal fibroblasts (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). In addition, CM from PARPi-treated fibroblasts recruited more stromal fibroblasts to the microenvironment, and the addition of CCL5 neutralizing antibody reduced this recruitment effect (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 4c). Most importantly, the addition of CCL5 neutralizing antibody significantly boosted the tumor-suppression role of PARPis in both BRCA1/2-wild type and BRCA1/2-mutant xenografts (Fig. 5e, f and Supplementary Fig. 4d, e), accompanied with partial reversal of PARPi-induced stromal activation (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. f-h), indicating that this enhanced tumor growth inhibition may be partially due to the elimination of CCL5 exertion on sustaining stromal fibroblast activation. Altogether, these data suggested that PARPi-induced CCL5 expression and secretion were indeed involved in the maintenance of stromal fibroblast activation and neutralization of CCL5 boosted the antitumor efficacy of PARPis in both BRCA1/2-wild type and BRCA1/2-mutant xenograft models.PARPis induce CCL5 expression in CAFs through the NF-\u03baB signaling pathwayPARPis induce CCL5 expression in fibroblasts through NF-\u03baB signaling.a GSEA of RNA-seq data showing significant enrichment for signature representing the NF-\u03baB pathway activation in Ola-treated CAFs. b Spearman\u2019s correlation analyses showing the relationship between calculated BIOCARTA_NFKB_PATHWAY score and CCL5 expression in the TCGA dataset, GSE 9891, GSE 51088, and GSE 40595. c The luciferase activity of p-NF-\u03baB in CAFs with or without PARPi exposure. d Representative IHC images and quantification of p-P65 protein expression in the Ola-challenged and control tumor stroma of SKOV3 xenografts.

Here GSEA results using our RNA-seq data showed that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was significantly enriched in fibroblasts treated with Ola, while the AP-1 signaling pathway did not change significantly (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 5a). ssGSEA results showed that CCL5 mRNA levels were significantly correlated with NF-\u03baB pathway activation scores in multiple OC databases (Fig. 6b). Therefore, we hypothesized that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was involved in PARPi-induced CCL5 elevation in fibroblasts, and a series of experiments were performed to verify this hypothesis. First, a p-NF-\u03baB reporter plasmid assay confirmed increased p-NF-\u03baB pathway activity in stromal fibroblasts after PARPi treatment (Fig. 6c). IHC of xenograft tumor sections revealed that p-NF-\u03baB protein was significantly elevated in the tumor stroma exposed to PARPis (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 5b, d). Additionally, correlation analysis of IHC scores demonstrated that CCL5 expression was markedly correlated with p-NF-\u03baB expression in xenograft tumor stroma (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Fig. 5c). In vitro, PARPi treatment increased p-NF-\u03baB protein expression in stromal fibroblasts (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 5e). Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that more p-NF-\u03baB particles entered the nucleus after PARPi treatment (Fig. 6g). In addition, BAY-117082, a specific inhibitor of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, effectively reduced the intracellular expression of p-NF-\u03baB, CCL5, and \u03b1-SMA induced by PARPi (Fig. 6h and Supplementary Fig. 5f) and significantly reversed extracellular CCL5 upregulation in fibroblasts treated with PARPi (Fig. 6i and Supplementary Fig. 5g). Collagen contraction assays showed that PARPi-induced fibroblast-upregulated ability in contracting ECM was attenuated through inhibiting NF-\u03baB pathway (Fig. 6j, k and Supplementary Fig. 5h). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway was involved in PARPi-induced CCL5 elevation in fibroblast activation.PARPis induce activation of stromal fibroblasts in human OC tumor specimensOlaparib induces stromal fibroblast activation in human OC tumor specimens.a Immunohistochemical detection of \u03b1-SMA in matched tumor specimens from patients with OC before and after administration with Ola.

Data are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m., *p\u2009<\u20090.05; **p\u2009<\u20090.01; ***p\u2009<\u20090.001.To extend these experimental observations to the clinical paradigm, we analyzed matched tumor specimens from six patients with OC before and after treatment with PARPis, and the corresponding clinical data are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The Ola-post tumor specimens were collected during the second surgery after at least 6 months of Ola maintenance and Ola was stopped within 3 days before the surgery. Details about the treatment of patient#14 and the collection of corresponding tumor specimens are exhibited in the Gantt chart (Supplementary Fig. 6). The results of IHC showed that \u03b1-SMA was significantly increased in tumor specimens after PARPi administration (Fig. 7a, b). Masson\u2019s trichrome and picrosirius red staining revealed that tumor specimens after PARPi administration had more abundant stroma accumulation (Fig. 7c\u2013e). Further IHC analysis showed higher expression of CCL5 and p-NF-\u03baB in tumor specimens after PARPi therapy (Fig. 7f, g). Furthermore, correlation analysis of IHC score showed that CCL5 expression was positively correlated with \u03b1-SMA expression, and p-NF-\u03baB expression was positively correlated with CCL5 expression (Fig. 7h, i). Collectively, the above results suggested that PARPi promoted stromal fibroblast activation in human OC tumor specimens.DiscussionThe majority of studies on PARPis have focused on defining appropriate candidates for them and expanding their applicability. Herein we extended the investigation of PARPis from cancer cells to stromal fibroblasts and discovered that stromal fibroblasts were intrinsically invulnerable to PARPis. Intriguingly, PARPis were found to promote stromal fibroblast activation in vitro and in both BRCA1/2-wild type and BRCA1/2-mutant xenograft models, which was further validated in clinically matched specimens derived from patients who had undergone administration of Ola until disease progression. PARPi-primed fibroblasts exhibited a specific secretory profile, in which CCL5 was identified to be required for PARPi-induced fibroblast recruitment and activation. Furthermore, neutralization of CCL5 blunted PARPi-driven fibroblast activation and boosted the cancer suppression efficiency of PARPis in BRCA1/2-wild type and BRCA1/2-mutant OC xenograft models. Further results implied that the NF-\u03baB pathway was involved in PARPi-induced secretion of CCL5 and that targeting this pathway could effectively reverse CCL5 secretion and decrease the continued activation of stromal fibroblasts (Fig. 7j). Together, our work uncovered a side effect of PARPis on tumor stromal fibroblast activation, suggesting that overcoming this \u201cside effect\u201d could potentially sensitize PARPis in OC.As the most paradigm-shifting breakthrough in OC management, PARPis have made great strides in OC. Ola was the first PARPi approved for the treatment of advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in patients harboring germline BRCA mutations and is now used for maintenance treatment of BRCA mutated advanced EOC patients. Importantly, Nira was approved for maintenance treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC who have achieved a complete or partial response regardless of BRCA status. As the widespread use and great benefits of Ola and Nira have been witnessed, the impacts of Ola and Nira on stromal fibroblasts are worth exploring. Here we observed that PARPis abnormally increased stromal fibroblast activation in vitro and in both BRCA1/2-wild type and BRCA1/2-mutant xenograft models. More importantly, matched post-treatment tumor specimens showed significantly elevated \u03b1-SMA and more abundant stromal content than pre-treatment specimens, indicating that PARPi-induced stromal activation also occurred in patients receiving PARPis. Activated CAFs are characterized by a more stretched morphology, upregulation of activated CAF markers, and a specific secretory phenotype and play important roles in cancer progression. Activated CAFs mainly stem from local resident normal fibroblasts educated by cancer cells, rather than directly from normal fibroblasts that have undergone somatic genetic mutation. Cancer cell-derived cytokines such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor-2 were reported to be capable of transforming normal fibroblasts to CAFs. In addition to cancer cells, other resident cells in the TME, such as macrophages, were also proven to activate adjacent fibroblasts. Strikingly, traditional chemotherapy reportedly triggers remodeling of the TME, including fibroblast transformation, thus promoting cancer recurrence and metastasis. These observations of fibroblast activation induced by traditional chemotherapy and targeted drugs such as PARPis in our study implied that stromal fibroblasts vigorously responded to DNA damage agents. As coevolution of CAFs and cancer cells during tumorigenesis is fundamental for cancer progression, disruption of the drug\u2013cancer microenvironment interplay could foster optimized therapeutic efficiency of traditional chemotherapy and targeted drugs.Molecular alternations and functional consequences associated with chemotherapy-primed CAFs have been profoundly investigated. Myriad studies have revealed that exposing stromal fibroblasts to cancer-targeted genotoxic agents resulted in significant upregulation of inflammatory factors or cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, matrix metalloproteinase-3, IL-6, WNT16B, and IL-8. Increases in proinflammatory factors enhance tumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic cancer, fuel the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells, and promote cell survival and resistance to apoptosis in prostate cancer. Mechanistically, the chemotherapy-induced persistent DNA damage response accounts for the upregulation of inflammatory factors or cytokines in fibroblasts. Similarly, PARPis were also observed to induce DNA damage in ovarian CAFs. However, unlike those facing traditional chemotherapies, PARPi-challenged CAFs could be liberated from this type of DNA damage and survive, which may be associated with factors including cell type and the duration, intensity, and nature of DNA damage. PARPi-treated CAFs in this study exhibited a specific secretory profile primarily characterized by upregulation of CCL5, MIP-3\u03b1, MCP3, CCL11, and ENA-78, in which CCL5 elevation was most prominent and was required for PARPi-induced fibroblast activation. Recently, PARPis were found to enhance CCL5 secretion in ERCC1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer by triggering the pTBK1/IRF3/NF-\u03baB signaling cascade. Similarly, our further results demonstrated that the NF-\u03baB pathway was involved in the PARPi-induced CCL5 secretion in CAFs. In summary, the effects of chemotherapy and targeted therapy on CAFs implicated several limitations of current treatment and indicated that targeting stromal fibroblast activation is also an avenue for novel therapies.Overcoming the host response induced by chemotherapy could substantially improve therapeutic outcome and patient survival. For instance, altering the dosing schedule of systemic chemotherapy from a maximum-tolerated dose to a low-dose metronomic (LDM) regimen was proven to temper the stromal response and treatment resistance. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin was shown to alleviate senescence-associated secretory phenotype in fibroblasts and to avoid their cancer-promoting effect in breast cancer. To optimize the anticancer efficacy of PARPis in OC, it might be pivotal to develop adjuvant therapies that curb stromal fibroblast activation. Among the PARPi-induced secretion profile of CAFs, we found that elevation of CCL5 was the most prominent and that PARPi-driven fibroblast activation was dependent on increased CCL5. In addition, neither OC cells nor OC cells treated with PARPis showed remarked CCL5 secretion compared with CAFs. Blocking CCL5 successfully alleviated PARPi-induced fibroblast activation and sensitized PARPis in OC and BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancer xenograft models, indicating that potential strategies to curb fibroblast activation, including neutralizing CCL5, facilitate augmenting the efficacy of PARPis in OC and BRCA1/2-mutant breast cancers. Our findings added to the knowledge of PARPi exertion in the context of the stromal compartment, which helped further complete our recognition of the effect of PARPis in OC.In conclusion, this study depicted the responses of OC stromal fibroblasts to PARPi that was distinct but highly complementary to its established role of causing synthetic lethality in HR-deficient cancer cells. PARPi-elicited specific secretory profile was proved to be required for PARPi-induced fibroblast activation. Together, our work uncovered a side effect of PARPi on stromal fibroblast activation, suggesting that overcoming this negative consequence could potentially sensitize PARPi in OC.MethodsCellsHuman OC cell lines, including OV90, OVCAR3, A2780, OVCAR8, SKOV3, and SW626, and human breast cancer cell line, HCC1937, were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured in MCDB 105 and Medium 199 (1:1), Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), RPMI-1640, RPMI-1640, McCoy\u20195A, L-15, and RPMI-1640 media, respectively. MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts were obtained from the cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Primary OC stromal fibroblasts were isolated and purified from fresh cancer tissues of OC patients as previously described, and baseline information is summarized in Supplementary Table 2, all participants provided written informed consent at recruitment, and the institutional ethics review committee of Tongji Hospital approved all study procedures for human subjects. MRC-5 cells were transformed into activated phenotype MRC5-CAFs by TGF-\u03b21 (50\u2009ng/ml). All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium (Gibco). All the above growth media were supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Scientific) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Mycoplasma testing (Lonza) was performed regularly in our institution, and all cell lines were tested once after thawing or isolation and before other experiments.Drug sensitivity assayCell viability was examined using a CCK-8 (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). A total of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were seeded into 96-well plates per well followed by treatment with serial concentrations of Ola or Nira (MCE, Shanghai, China) for 72\u2009h. After incubation with CCK-8, the number of viable cells was measured at an absorbance of 450\u2009nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Each assay was performed in triplicate (n\u2009=\u20093).IHC, picrosirius red staining, and Masson\u2019s trichrome stainingFirst, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene. After antigen retrieval, the slides were treated using 3% H2O2, blocked with 5% bovine serum, and incubated with primary antibodies against \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam, USA, used at 1/200 dilution), CCL5 (710001, Invitrogen, USA, used at 1/20 dilution), and phosphorylated (p)-NF-\u03baB(Ser536) (ab28856, Abcam, USA, used at 1/100 dilution) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The next day, the slides were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody and then treated using the DAB Kit (BD Bioscience). Subsequently, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. These results were also reviewed and scored independently by two investigators based on the staining intensity and the positively stained areas. Masson\u2019s trichrome and picrosirius red (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) staining was carried out on paraffin-embedded sections of xenograft tumors and human OC tumor specimens, and the results were analyzed using ImageJ as described previously.Western blot analysisCell extracts were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). A total of 40\u2009\u00b5g of protein for each sample was separated on 8\u201312% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight, followed by secondary antibodies for 1\u2009h. Antibodies against \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, used at 1/400 dilution) and CCL5 (ab18984, used at 1/1000 dilution) were obtained from Abcam Biotechnology (Abcam, CA, USA). Antibodies against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were obtained from Proteintech (Manchester, United Kingdom). The p-NF-\u03baB p65 antibody (#3033, used at 1/1000 dilution) and total NF-\u03baB p65 antibody (#8242, used at 1/1000 dilution) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Finally, the membranes were treated with the corresponding HRP-linked secondary antibody (Abcam, USA) and were then detected with an enhanced ECL system (Pierce). All blots were derived from the same experiment and then they were processed in parallel; un-cropped images of all blots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.Immunofluorescence analysisCells were fixed on coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Next, the cells were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin and then treated with primary antibodies, such as \u03b1-SMA (ab124964, Abcam, USA, used at 1/250 dilution), p-NF-\u03baB p65 antibody (#3033, CST, USA, used at 1/1600 dilution), RAD51 (ab133534, Abcam, USA, used at 1/1000 dilution), and \u03b3-H2AX (ab22551, Abcam, USA, used at 1/200 dilution) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The next day, the cells were incubated with secondary donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated, Antgene, China, used at 1/200 dilution) or secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated, Antgene, China, used at 1/200 dilution). Then coverslips were treated with Phalloidin-iFluor 488 Reagent (ab176753) and DAPI (Servicebio, Wuhan, China). The fluorescence images were photographed with an Olympus BX53 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Each experiment was conducted in triplicate (n\u2009=\u20093).Collagen gel contraction assayAn in vitro floating collagen matrix contraction model was utilized to determine the contractile capacity of fibroblasts as described in our prior study. The images of gels were analyzed with the ImageJ software. All results are presented as a percentage of the original well area, and all contraction assays were performed in triplicate (n\u2009=\u20093).Cell cycle assayFor cell cycle analysis, the cells were trypsinized and fixed with 70% cold ethanol overnight at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C. The next day, the cells were centrifuged and then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20\u2009mg/ml propidium iodide solution (Roche Diagnostics) and 50\u2009mg/ml RNAse A (Qiagen). Finally, the cell cycle status was detected using flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter), and the results were analyzed by the FlowJo software. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate (n\u2009=\u20093).Transwell migration assayFirst, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MRC5-CAFs or primary CAFs were seeded into the upper chamber of the Transwell apparatus, and 600\u2009\u03bcl of CM collected from Ola or Ola with anti-CCL5 (Human CCL5 antibody, AF-278-NA, R&D Systems, USA), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated MRC5-CAFs or primary CAFs, was added into the lower chamber of the 24-well plate. The upper chambers were removed and fixed with methanol for 30\u2009min and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20\u2009min after 24\u2009h of culture. Finally, cells that did not migrate and remained stuck on the inner side of the chamber were wiped using a cotton bud, and the remaining migrated cells on the external side were observed and analyzed under microscopy. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate (n\u2009=\u20093).Luciferase reporter assayFor the luciferase reporter assay, cells were prepared in a six-well plate and transfected with the p-NF-\u03baB reporter plasmid (D2206, Beyotime, Shanghai). After 24\u2009h of transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with PARPis for 72\u2009h. Then the luciferase activities were measured by a Firefly Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Each measurement was performed in triplicate (n\u2009=\u20093).RT-PCR and RNA-seqTotal RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) in accordance with standard manufacturer\u2019s protocols. For RT-PCR analysis, complementary DNA was synthesized using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase (Takara, Japan). RT-PCR was performed in triplicate (n\u2009=\u20093) using the Bio-Rad CFX96 system with SYBR Green. The relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the comparative Cq method (\u0394\u0394 Cq method) on the basis of GAPDH as the reference gene. List of the primer sequences are included in Supplementary Table 3. For RNA-seq analysis, total RNA was sent to the sequencing company for sequencing using the Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencing platform. According to the |log2Ratio|\u2009\u2265\u20091 and p value <0.05 difference standards, edgeR R-3.3.3 was used to screen for differential genes. GO analysis was conducted using the topGO software. KOBAS 2.0 software was used to test the statistical enrichment of differentially expressed genes in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways.Human antibody arrayHuman antibody arrays were performed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, CM samples from different groups were collected in centrifuge tubes, and the cells remaining on the dish were counted to normalize CM volumes for cell number. The CM samples were clarified by brief centrifugation, diluted with serum-free medium to a concentration equivalent to 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells per 1.5\u2009ml, and applied to the human cytokine antibody array AAH-CYT-G5 (RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, USA). Signals of proteins were determined with a GenePix 4200\u2009A professional microarray scanner.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)CM samples from PARPi-treated CAFs and control CAFs were collected as described above and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. The concentration of CCL5 in each supernatant was measured using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Absorbance at 450\u2009nm was measured by a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Each measurement was performed in triplicate (n\u2009=\u20093).Animal assaysAll animal experiments were conducted in compliance with approval of the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments in Hubei Province. BALB/c nude mice (weight 20\u201323\u2009g, 4\u20136 weeks) were purchased and were manipulated in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions and used as a xenograft model. Twenty-four mice were injected subcutaneously with each tumor cell line (including SKOV3, OVCAR8, OV90, and HCC1937) for 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cell per mouse. Seven days after inoculation, mice were randomly assigned to the PARPi single agent group (n\u2009=\u20098), the control group (n\u2009=\u20098), and the combination treatment group (n\u2009=\u20098). For PARPi single agent group, mice were injected intraperitoneally with Ola (50\u2009mg/kg/day) or Nira (50\u2009mg/kg/day). Mice in the control group were injected intraperitoneally with equal volume of saline mixed with 1% DMSO. To verify the effect of CCL5 blockade on stromal activation, we added the combination treatment group of mice that were administered with intraperitoneal Ola (50\u2009mg/kg/day) or Nira (50\u2009mg/kg/day) combining with CCL5 neutralizing antibodies (1\u2009mg/kg, twice a week) (AF-478, R&D Systems, USA). Every 7 days after cell injection, the subcutaneous tumor volume was measured. On day 35 after cell injection, all mice were humanely sacrificed under anesthesia. Macroscopic lesions were recorded and tumor nodules were dissected, weighed, and paraffin embedded for subsequent detection.Statistical analysisAll results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 and are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m. based on at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance between two groups was calculated by Student\u2019s unpaired two-tailed t test. Comparisons between multiple groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered as statistically significant (*), p\u2009<\u20090.01 was considered highly significant (**), and p\u2009<\u20090.001 was considered extremely significant (***).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.These authors contributed equally: Xiaoting Li, Tian Fang, Sen Xu, Ping Jin, Dongchen Zhou.Supplementary informationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41698-021-00189-w.Author contributionsConception and design of the work: X.L., S.X., and Q.G.
