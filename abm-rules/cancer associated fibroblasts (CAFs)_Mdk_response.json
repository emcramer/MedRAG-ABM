    "I apologize, but I cannot provide any rules for the signal \"Mdk\" and the cell type \"cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs)\" based on the provided documents. The documents you provided do not mention \"Mdk\" as a signal or discuss its effects on CAFs. To generate rules for \"Mdk\" and CAFs, I would need additional information, such as: * **Research papers:** Provide research papers that specifically discuss the effects of \"Mdk\" on CAFs. * **Signal type:** Is \"Mdk\" a secreted ligand, a cell-cell contact signal, or another type of signal? * **Specific behavior:** What behavior do you want to model for CAFs in response to \"Mdk\"? (e.g., proliferation, migration, death, secretion, etc.) Once you provide this information, I can help you generate rules in the desired format. "
